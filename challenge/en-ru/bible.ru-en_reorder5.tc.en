God called the light " day , " and the darkness he called " night . " there was evening and there was morning , one day .
God said , " Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters . "
God called the dry land " earth , " and the gathering together of the waters he called " seas . " God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the earth yield grass , herbs yielding seed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with its seed in it , on the earth " ; and it was so .
God said , " Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days and years ;
and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth " ; and it was so .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky . "
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
to every animal of the earth , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that creeps on the earth , in which there is life , I have given every green herb for food " ; and it was so .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
and the gold of that land is good . there is aromatic resin and the onyx stone .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
Yahweh God said , " It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him a helper suitable for him . "
Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man , and he slept ; and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
he made the rib , which Yahweh God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
the man said , " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . she will be called ' woman , ' because she was taken out of Man . "
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made . he said to the woman , " Has God really said , ' You shall not eat of any tree of the garden ? ' "
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
the man said , " I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself . "
Yahweh God said to the woman , " What is this you have done ? " the woman said , " The serpent deceived me , and I ate . "
to the woman he said , " I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth . in pain you will bear children . your desire will be for your husband , and he will rule over you . "
it will yield thorns and thistles to you ; and you will eat the herb of the field .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
again she gave birth , to Cain 's brother Abel . Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don 't do well , sin crouches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
Cain said to Abel , his brother , " Let 's go into the field . " it happened when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel , his brother , and killed him .
Yahweh said to Cain , " Where is Abel , your brother ? " he said , " I don 't know . am I my brother 's keeper ? "
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
behold , you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me . "
Zillah also gave birth to tubal Cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron . tubal Cain 's sister was Naamah .
Lamech said to his wives , " Adah and Zillah , hear my voice . you wives of Lamech , listen to my speech , for I have slain a man for wounding me , a young man for bruising me .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own likeness , after his image , and named him Seth .
Enoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah three hundred years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
and he named him Noah , saying , " This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands , because of the ground which Yahweh has cursed . "
Yahweh said , " My Spirit will not strive with man forever , because he also is flesh ; yet will his days be one hundred twenty years . "
Yahweh said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground ; man , along with animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . "
God said to Noah , " The end of all flesh has come before me , for the earth is filled with violence through them . behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make a ship of gopher wood . you shall make rooms in the ship , and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
you shall make a roof in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cubit upward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
take with you of all food that is eaten , and gather it to yourself ; and it will be for food for you , and for them . "
you shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you , the male and his female . of the animals that are not clean , take two , the male and his female .
also of the birds of the sky , seven and seven , male and female , to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
in the same day Noah , and Shem , Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
the waters prevailed , and increased greatly on the earth ; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters .
he sent out a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground ,
but the dove found no place to rest her foot , and she returned to him into the ship ; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth . he put out his hand , and took her , and brought her to him into the ship .
the dove came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
in the second month , on the twenty @-@ seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
" go out of the ship , you , and your wife , and your sons , and your sons ' wives with you .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh , including birds , livestock , and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth , that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply on the earth . "
while the earth remains , seed time and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease . "
the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground teems with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will surely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
" as for me , behold , I establish my covenant with you , and with your offspring after you ,
I set my rainbow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth .
it will happen , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud ,
the rainbow will be in the cloud . I will look at it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . "
God said to Noah , " This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth . "
Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they didn 't see their father 's nakedness .
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as you go toward Gerar , to Gaza ; as you go toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , to Lasha .
to Eber were born two sons . the name of the one was Peleg , for in his days the earth was divided . his brother 's name was Joktan .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations . of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
they said one to another , " Come , let 's make bricks , and burn them thoroughly . " they had brick for stone , and they used tar for mortar .
Yahweh said , " Behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be withheld from them , which they intend to do .
so Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Babel , because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth . from there , Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
Abram and Nahor took wives . the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah .
now Yahweh said to Abram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
Yahweh appeared to Abram and said , " I will give this land to your seed . " he built an altar there to Yahweh , who appeared to him .
there was a famine in the land . Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sarai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
please say that you are my sister , that it may be well with me for your sake , and that my soul may live because of you . "
why did you say , ' She is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Abram called on the name of Yahweh .
there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .
Abram said to Lot , " Please , let there be no strife between me and you , and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen ; for we are relatives .
lot lifted up his eyes , and saw all the plain of the Jordan , that it was well @-@ watered everywhere , before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , like the garden of Yahweh , like the land of Egypt , as you go to Zoar .
Abram lived in the land of Canaan , and Lot lived in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as Sodom .
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
that they made war with Bera , king of Sodom , and with Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , and Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) .
all these joined together in the valley of Siddim ( the same is the Salt Sea ) .
in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came , and the kings who were with him , and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzim in Ham , and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim ,
they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their food , and went their way .
one who had escaped came and told Abram , the Hebrew . now he lived by the oaks of Mamre , the Amorite , brother of Eshcol , and brother of Aner ; and these were allies of Abram .
the king of Sodom said to Abram , " Give me the people , and take the goods to yourself . "
Abram said to the king of Sodom , " I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh , God Most High , possessor of heaven and earth ,
that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours , lest you should say , ' I have made Abram rich . '
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men who went with me : Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . let them take their portion . "
after these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision , saying , " Don 't be afraid , Abram . I am your shield , your exceedingly great reward . "
Abram said , " Lord Yahweh , what will you give me , since I go childless , and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus ? "
Abram said , " Behold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
Yahweh brought him outside , and said , " Look now toward the sky , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . " he said to Abram , " So shall your seed be . "
he said to him , " I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give you this land to inherit it . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he didn 't divide the birds .
he said to Abram , " Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs , and will serve them . they will afflict them four hundred years .
in the fourth generation they will come here again , for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full . "
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
in that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram , saying , " To your seed I have given this land , from the river of Egypt to the great river , the river Euphrates :
now Sarai , Abram 's wife , bore him no children . she had a handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
but Abram said to Sarai , " Behold , your maid is in your hand . do to her whatever is good in your eyes . " Sarai dealt harshly with her , and she fled from her face .
the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
he said , " Hagar , Sarai 's handmaid , where did you come from ? where are you going ? " she said , " I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " Behold , you are with child , and will bear a son . you shall call his name Ishmael , because Yahweh has heard your affliction .
he will be like a wild donkey among men . his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him . he will live opposite all of his brothers . "
when Abram was ninety @-@ nine years old , Yahweh appeared to Abram , and said to him , " I am God Almighty . walk before me , and be blameless .
neither will your name any more be called Abram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will give to you , and to your seed after you , the land where you are traveling , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession . I will be their God . "
he who is born in your house , and he who is bought with your money , must be circumcised . my covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my covenant . "
then Abraham fell on his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , " Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old ? will Sarah , who is ninety years old , give birth ? "
God said , " No , but Sarah , your wife , will bear you a son . you shall call his name Isaac . I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him .
Abraham took Ishmael his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Abraham 's house , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day , as God had said to him .
Abraham was ninety @-@ nine years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
and said , " My lord , if now I have found favor in your sight , please don 't go away from your servant .
Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah , and said , " Quickly prepare three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes . "
they asked him , " Where is Sarah , your wife ? " he said , " See , in the tent . "
is anything too hard for Yahweh ? at the set time I will return to you , when the season comes round , and Sarah will have a son . "
since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him ?
for I have known him , to the end that he may command his children and his household after him , that they may keep the way of Yahweh , to do righteousness and justice ; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him . "
I will go down now , and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me . if not , I will know . "
Yahweh said , " If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sake . "
Abraham answered , " See now , I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord , who am but dust and ashes .
what if there will lack five of the fifty righteous ? will you destroy all the city for lack of five ? " he said , " I will not destroy it , if I find forty @-@ five there . "
he spoke to him yet again , and said , " What if there are forty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it for the forty 's sake . "
he said , " Oh don 't let the Lord be angry , and I will speak . what if there are thirty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it , if I find thirty there . "
the two angels came to Sodom at evening . lot sat in the gate of Sodom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bowed himself with his face to the earth ,
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
when the morning came , then the angels hurried Lot , saying , " Get up ! take your wife , and your two daughters who are here , lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city . "
but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
it came to pass , when they had taken them out , that he said , " Escape for your life ! Don 't look behind you , and don 't stay anywhere in the plain . escape to the mountains , lest you be consumed ! "
he said to him , " Behold , I have granted your request concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken .
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived .
the firstborn said to the younger , " Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth .
the younger also bore a son , and called his name Ben Ammi . he is the father of the children of Ammon to this day .
Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South , and lived between Kadesh and Shur . he lived as a foreigner in Gerar .
didn 't he tell me , ' She is my sister ? ' she , even she herself , said , ' He is my brother . ' in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this . "
God said to him in the dream , " Yes , I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this , and I also withheld you from sinning against me . therefore I didn 't allow you to touch her .
now therefore , restore the man 's wife . for he is a prophet , and he will pray for you , and you will live . if you don 't restore her , know for sure that you will die , you , and all who are yours . "
to Sarah he said , " Behold , I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver . behold , it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you . in front of all you are vindicated . "
Sarah conceived , and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
therefore she said to Abraham , " Cast out this handmaid and her son ! for the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son , Isaac . "
I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid , because he is your seed . "
Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread and a bottle of water , and gave it to Hagar , putting it on her shoulder ; and gave her the child , and sent her away . she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bow shot away . for she said , " Don 't let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and wept .
God heard the voice of the boy . the angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hagar ? Don 't be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
get up , lift up the boy , and hold him in your hand . for I will make him a great nation . "
he lived in the wilderness of Paran . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
he said , " You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand , that it may be a witness to me , that I have dug this well . "
so they made a covenant at Beersheba . Abimelech rose up with Phicol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba , and called there on the name of Yahweh , the Everlasting God .
it happened after these things , that God tested Abraham , and said to him , " Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Abraham rose early in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
Abraham said to his young men , " Stay here with the donkey . the boy and I will go yonder . we will worship , and come back to you . "
Abraham said , " God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering , my son . " so they both went together .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
the angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky , and said , " Abraham , Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
he said , " Don 't lay your hand on the boy , neither do anything to him . for now I know that you fear God , since you have not withheld your son , your only son , from me . "
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
it happened after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , " Behold , Milcah , she also has borne children to your brother Nahor :
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a burying @-@ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying @-@ place . "
" no , my lord , hear me . I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you . bury your dead . "
" my lord , listen to me . what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you ? therefore bury your dead . "
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
so the field of Ephron , which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field , the cave which was in it , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all of its borders , were deeded
the field , and the cave that is in it , were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth .
but you shall go to my country , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son Isaac . "
if the woman isn 't willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the servant took ten camels , of his master 's camels , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
he said , " Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , please give me success this day , and show kindness to my master Abraham .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher on her shoulder .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
the servant ran to meet her , and said , " Please give me a drink , a little water from your pitcher . "
she said , " Drink , my lord . " she hurried , and let down her pitcher on her hand , and gave him drink .
when she had done giving him drink , she said , " I will also draw for your camels , until they have done drinking . "
it happened , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
and said , " Whose daughter are you ? please tell me . is there room in your father 's house for us to lodge in ? "
the man came into the house , and he unloaded the camels . he gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
food was set before him to eat , but he said , " I will not eat until I have told my message . " he said , " Speak on . "
Yahweh has blessed my master greatly . he has become great . he has given him flocks and herds , silver and gold , male servants and female servants , and camels and donkeys .
Sarah , my master 's wife , bore a son to my master when she was old . he has given all that he has to him .
my master made me swear , saying , ' You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I live ,
but you shall go to my father 's house , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son . '
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don 't give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
before I had finished speaking in my heart , behold , Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder . she went down to the spring , and drew . I said to her , ' Please let me drink . '
I asked her , and said , ' Whose daughter are you ? ' she said , ' The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bore to him . ' I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her hands .
I bowed my head , and worshiped Yahweh , and blessed Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left . "
behold , Rebekah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yahweh has spoken . "
the servant brought out jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
her brother and her mother said , " Let the young lady stay with us a few days , at least ten . after that she will go . "
he said to them , " Don 't hinder me , since Yahweh has prospered my way . send me away that I may go to my master . "
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she dismounted from the camel .
she said to the servant , " Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? " the servant said , " It is my master . " she took her veil , and covered herself .
Jokshan became the father of Sheba , and Dedan . the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , Letushim , and Leummim .
the sons of Midian : ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . all these were the children of Keturah .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
Yahweh said to her , " Two nations are in your womb . two peoples will be separated from your body . the one people will be stronger than the other people . the elder will serve the younger . "
Esau said , " Behold , I am about to die . what good is the birthright to me ? "
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will bless you . for to you , and to your seed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father .
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was caressing Rebekah , his wife .
Abimelech said , " What is this you have done to us ? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife , and you would have brought guilt on us ! "
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
the herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac 's herdsmen , saying , " The water is ours . " he called the name of the well Esek , because they contended with him .
Yahweh appeared to him the same night , and said , " I am the God of Abraham your father . Don 't be afraid , for I am with you , and will bless you , and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham 's sake . "
Isaac said to them , " Why have you come to me , since you hate me , and have sent me away from you ? "
they said , " We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you . we said , ' Let there now be an oath between us , even between us and you , and let us make a covenant with you ,
that you will do us no harm , as we have not touched you , and as we have done to you nothing but good , and have sent you away in peace . ' you are now the blessed of Yahweh . "
they rose up some time in the morning , and swore one to another . Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
he said , " See now , I am old . I don 't know the day of my death .
now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison .
make me savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them savory food for your father , such as he loves .
you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . "
what if my father touches me ? I will seem to him as a deceiver , and I would bring a curse on myself , and not a blessing . "
Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
he came to his father , and said , " My father ? " he said , " Here I am . who are you , my son ? "
Jacob said to his father , " I am Esau your firstborn . I have done what you asked me to do . please arise , sit and eat of my venison , that your soul may bless me . "
Isaac said to his son , " How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? " he said , " Because Yahweh your God gave me success . "
Isaac said to Jacob , " Please come near , that I may feel you , my son , whether you are really my son Esau or not . "
Jacob went near to Isaac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau . "
he said , " Are you really my son Esau ? " he said , " I am . "
he said , " Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
he came near , and kissed him . he smelled the smell of his clothing , and blessed him , and said , " Behold , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed .
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
he also made savory food , and brought it to his father . he said to his father , " Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that your soul may bless me . "
when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " Bless me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac answered Esau , " Behold , I have made him your lord , and all his brothers have I given to him for servants . with grain and new wine have I sustained him . what then will I do for you , my son ? "
Isaac his father answered him , " Behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him . Esau said in his heart , " The days of mourning for my father are at hand . then I will kill my brother Jacob . "
the words of Esau , her elder son , were told to Rebekah . she sent and called Jacob , her younger son , and said to him , " Behold , your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you .
until your brother 's anger turn away from you , and he forgets what you have done to him . then I will send , and get you from there . why should I be bereaved of you both in one day ? "
Rebekah said to Isaac , " I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth . if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these , of the daughters of the land , what good will my life do me ? "
and give you the blessing of Abraham , to you , and to your seed with you , that you may inherit the land where you travel , which God gave to Abraham . "
Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sleep .
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
Jacob awakened out of his sleep , and he said , " Surely Yahweh is in this place , and I didn 't know it . "
he was afraid , and said , " How dreadful is this place ! this is none other than God 's house , and this is the gate of heaven . "
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
Jacob vowed a vow , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clothing to put on ,
he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and , behold , three flocks of sheep lying there by it . for out of that well they watered the flocks . the stone on the well 's mouth was large .
there all the flocks were gathered . they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again on the well 's mouth in its place .
Jacob said to them , " My relatives , where are you from ? " they said , " We are from Haran . "
he said to them , " Is it well with him ? " they said , " It is well . see , Rachel , his daughter , is coming with the sheep . "
they said , " We can 't , until all the flocks are gathered together , and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth . then we water the sheep . "
it happened , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban , his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban , his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Laban heard the news of Jacob , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jacob , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . Jacob told Laban all these things .
Laban said , " It is better that I give her to you , than that I should give her to another man . stay with me . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
it happened in the morning that , behold , it was Leah . he said to Laban , " What is this you have done to me ? didn 't I serve with you for Rachel ? why then have you deceived me ? "
fulfill the week of this one , and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years . "
she conceived again , and bore a son , and said , " Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated , he has therefore given me this son also . " she named him Simeon .
she said , " Behold , my maid Bilhah . go in to her , that she may bear on my knees , and I also may obtain children by her . "
Rachel said , " God has judged me , and has also heard my voice , and has given me a son . " therefore called she his name Dan .
when Leah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zilpah , her handmaid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them to his mother , Leah . then Rachel said to Leah , " Please give me some of your son 's mandrakes . "
she said to her , " Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband ? would you take away my son 's mandrakes , also ? " Rachel said , " Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son 's mandrakes . "
Jacob came from the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , " You must come in to me ; for I have surely hired you with my son 's mandrakes . " he lay with her that night .
it happened , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
Laban said to him , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , stay here , for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake . "
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multitude . Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
he said , " What shall I give you ? " Jacob said , " You shall not give me anything . if you will do this thing for me , I will again feed your flock and keep it .
that day , he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted , and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were feeble , he didn 't put them in . so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
the man increased exceedingly , and had large flocks , female servants and male servants , and camels and donkeys .
he heard the words of Laban 's sons , saying , " Jacob has taken away all that was our father 's . from that which was our father 's , has he gotten all this wealth . "
Yahweh said to Jacob , " Return to the land of your fathers , and to your relatives , and I will be with you . "
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a pillar , where you vowed a vow to me . now arise , get out from this land , and return to the land of your birth . ' "
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead .
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ' Take heed to yourself that you don 't speak to Jacob either good or bad . '
Laban went into Jacob 's tent , into Leah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he didn 't find them . he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the teraphim , put them in the camel 's saddle , and sat on them . Laban felt about all the tent , but didn 't find them .
she said to her father , " Don 't let my lord be angry that I can 't rise up before you ; for I 'm having my period . " he searched , but didn 't find the teraphim .
now that you have felt around in all my stuff , what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven 't eaten the rams of your flocks .
that which was torn of animals , I didn 't bring to you . I bore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
this was my situation : in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep fled from my eyes .
may this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
when he saw them , Jacob said , " This is God 's army . " he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , the field of Edom .
the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , " We came to your brother Esau . not only that , but he comes to meet you , and four hundred men with him . "
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks , and the herds , and the camels , into two companies ;
and he said , " If Esau comes to the one company , and strikes it , then the company which is left will escape . "
Jacob said , " God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , Yahweh , who said to me , ' Return to your country , and to your relatives , and I will do you good , '
please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Esau , when you find him .
you shall say , ' Not only that , but behold , your servant , Jacob , is behind us . ' " for , he said , " I will appease him with the present that goes before me , and afterward I will see his face . perhaps he will accept me . "
when he saw that he didn 't prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was strained , as he wrestled .
the man said , " Let me go , for the day breaks . " Jacob said , " I won 't let you go , unless you bless me . "
he said , " Your name will no longer be called Jacob , but Israel ; for you have fought with God and with men , and have prevailed . "
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Leah , Rachel , and the two handmaids .
Esau said , " What do you mean by all this company which I met ? " Jacob said , " To find favor in the sight of my lord . "
Jacob said , " Please , no , if I have now found favor in your sight , then receive my present at my hand , because I have seen your face , as one sees the face of God , and you were pleased with me .
please take the gift that I brought to you , because God has dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . " he urged him , and he took it .
Jacob said to him , " My lord knows that the children are tender , and that the flocks and herds with me have their young , and if they overdrive them one day , all the flocks will die .
please let my lord pass over before his servant , and I will lead on gently , according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord to Seir . "
Esau said , " Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me . " he said , " Why ? let me find favor in the sight of my lord . "
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan Aram ; and encamped before the city .
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
his soul joined to Dinah , the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the young lady , and spoke kindly to the young lady .
the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it . the men were grieved , and they were very angry , because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; a which thing ought not to be done .
ask me a great amount for a dowry , and I will give whatever you ask of me , but give me the young lady as a wife . "
and said to them , " We can 't do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised ; for that is a reproach to us .
then will we give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if you will not listen to us , to be circumcised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man didn 't wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
" these men are peaceful with us . therefore let them live in the land and trade in it . for behold , the land is large enough for them . let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor , and to Shechem his son ; and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
it happened on the third day , when they were sore , that two of Jacob 's sons , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brothers , each took his sword , came upon the unsuspecting city , and killed all the males .
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
God said to Jacob , " Arise , go up to Bethel , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " Put away the foreign gods that are among you , purify yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they traveled , and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them , and they didn 't pursue the sons of Jacob .
God said to him , " I am God Almighty . be fruitful and multiply . a nation and a company of nations will be from you , and kings will come out of your body .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
when she was in hard labor , the midwife said to her , " Don 't be afraid , for now you will have another son . "
Jacob set up a pillar on her grave . the same is the Pillar of Rachel 's grave to this day .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father 's concubine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon , the Hittite ; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , the Hivite ;
Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jalam , and Korah . these are the sons of Esau , who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
Timna was concubine to Eliphaz , Esau 's son ; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek . these are the sons of Adah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Reuel : Nahath , Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah . these were the sons of Basemath , Esau 's wife .
these were the sons of Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : she bore to Esau Jeush , Jalam , and Korah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau : chief Teman , chief Omar , chief Zepho , chief Kenaz ,
chief Korah , chief Gatam , chief Amalek : these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Adah .
these are the sons of Reuel , Esau 's son : chief Nahath , chief Zerah , chief Shammah , chief Mizzah : these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Basemath , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Oholibamah , Esau 's wife : chief Jeush , chief Jalam , chief Korah : these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the children of Zibeon : Aiah and Anah . this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness , as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father .
chief Dishon , chief Ezer , and chief Dishan : these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , according to their chiefs in the land of Seir .
these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before any king reigned over the children of Israel .
Husham died , and hadad , the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . the name of his city was Avith .
Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his place . the name of his city was Pau . his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
chief Magdiel , and chief Iram . these are the chiefs of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession . this is Esau , the father of the Edomites .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age , and he made him a coat of many colors .
for behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves came around , and bowed down to my sheaf . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brothers , and said , " Behold , I have dreamed yet another dream : and behold , the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . "
Israel said to Joseph , " aren 't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send you to them . " he said to him , " Here I am . "
he said to him , " Go now , see whether it is well with your brothers , and well with the flock ; and bring me word again . " so he sent him out of the valley of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Reuben heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , " Let 's not take his life . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead , with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
come , and let 's sell him to the Ishmaelites , and not let our hand be on him ; for he is our brother , our flesh . " his brothers listened to him .
Midianites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
he returned to his brothers , and said , " The child is no more ; and I , where will I go ? "
they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a male goat , and dipped the coat in the blood .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . he said , " For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning . " his father wept for him .
the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard .
it happened at that time , that Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
Judah said to Onan , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
Onan knew that the seed wouldn 't be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
he said , " I will send you a young goat from the flock . " she said , " Will you give me a pledge , until you send it ? "
he said , " What pledge will I give you ? " she said , " Your signet and your cord , and your staff that is in your hand . " he gave them to her , and came in to her , and she conceived by him .
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
then he asked the men of her place , saying , " Where is the prostitute , that was at Enaim by the road ? " they said , " There has been no prostitute here . "
he returned to Judah , and said , " I haven 't found her ; and also the men of the place said , ' There has been no prostitute here . ' "
it happened about three months later , that it was told Judah , saying , " Tamar , your daughter @-@ in @-@ law , has played the prostitute ; and moreover , behold , she is with child by prostitution . " Judah said , " Bring her out , and let her be burnt . "
Judah acknowledged them , and said , " She is more righteous than I , because I didn 't give her to Shelah , my son . " he knew her again no more .
it happened in the time of her travail , that behold , twins were in her womb .
when she travailed , one put out a hand , and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand , saying , " This came out first . "
it happened , as he drew back his hand , that behold , his brother came out , and she said , " Why have you made a breach for yourself ? " therefore his name was called Perez .
afterward his brother came out , that had the scarlet thread on his hand , and his name was called Zerah .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
she called to the men of her house , and spoke to them , saying , " Behold , he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us . he came in to me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice .
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mock me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand . "
but remember me when it will be well with you , and please show kindness to me , and make mention of me to Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon . "
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said to Joseph , " I also was in my dream , and behold , three baskets of white bread were on my head .
in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head . "
behold , seven heads of grain , thin and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
it happened , as he interpreted to us , so it was : he restored me to my office , and he hanged him . "
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . he shaved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Pharaoh .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " I have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpret it . "
and behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , fat and sleek . they fed in the marsh grass ,
and behold , seven heads of grain , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
Joseph said to Pharaoh , " The dream of Pharaoh is one . what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh .
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of famine .
that is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh .
there will arise after them seven years of famine , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt . the famine will consume the land ,
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , " Why do you look at one another ? "
he said , " Behold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth .
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them , and said to them , " You are spies ! you have come to see the nakedness of the land . "
they said , " We , your servants , are twelve brothers , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is no more . "
send one of you , and let him get your brother , and you shall be bound , that your words may be tested , whether there is truth in you , or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies . "
they said one to another , " We are certainly guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the distress of his soul , when he begged us , and we wouldn 't listen . therefore this distress has come upon us . "
Reuben answered them , saying , " didn 't I tell you , saying , ' Don 't sin against the child , ' and you wouldn 't listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
he said to his brothers , " My money is restored ! behold , it is in my sack ! " their hearts failed them , and they turned trembling one to another , saying , " What is this that God has done to us ? "
we are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan . '
bring your youngest brother to me . then I will know that you are not spies , but that you are honest men . so I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall trade in the land . ' "
Jacob , their father , said to them , " You have bereaved me of my children ! Joseph is no more , Simeon is no more , and you want to take Benjamin away . all these things are against me . "
it happened , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " Go again , buy us a little more food . "
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
Judah said to Israel , his father , " Send the boy with me , and we 'll get up and go , so that we may live , and not die , both we , and you , and also our little ones .
they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
when we came to the lodging place , we opened our sacks , and behold , each man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
he said , " Peace be to you . Don 't be afraid . your God , and the God of your father , has given you treasure in your sacks . I received your money . " he brought Simeon out to them .
he asked them of their welfare , and said , " Is your father well , the old man of whom you spoke ? is he yet alive ? "
they said , " Your servant , our father , is well . he is still alive . " they bowed down humbly .
he washed his face , and came out . he controlled himself , and said , " Serve the meal . "
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don 't eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination to the Egyptians .
he commanded the steward of his house , saying , " Fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
when they had gone out of the city , and were not yet far off , Joseph said to his steward , " Up , follow after the men . when you overtake them , ask them , ' Why have you rewarded evil for good ?
isn 't this that from which my lord drinks , and by which he indeed divines ? you have done evil in so doing . ' "
they said to him , " Why does my lord speak such words as these ? far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing !
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
with whomever of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondservants . "
he searched , beginning with the eldest , and ending at the youngest . the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
Joseph said to them , " What deed is this that you have done ? Don 't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine ? "
Judah said , " What will we tell my lord ? what will we speak ? or how will we clear ourselves ? God has found out the iniquity of your servants . behold , we are my lord 's bondservants , both we , and he also in whose hand the cup is found . "
he said , " Far be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the cup is found , he will be my bondservant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Judah came near to him , and said , " Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and don 't let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even as Pharaoh .
we said to my lord , ' We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother ; and his father loves him . '
you said to your servants , ' Bring him down to me , that I may set my eyes on him . '
we said to my lord , ' The boy can 't leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " Surely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven 't seen him since .
now therefore when I come to your servant my father , and the boy is not with us ; since his life is bound up in the boy 's life ;
it will happen , when he sees that the boy is no more , that he will die . your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant , our father , with sorrow to Sheol .
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bondservant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
Joseph said to his brothers , " Come near to me , please . " they came near . " he said , I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
for these two years the famine has been in the land , and there are yet five years , in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
so now it wasn 't you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to Pharaoh , lord of all his house , and ruler over all the land of Egypt .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
the sons of Israel did so . Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
he gave each one of them changes of clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing .
he sent the following to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
they told him , saying , " Joseph is still alive , and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt . " his heart fainted , for he didn 't believe them .
he said , " I am God , the God of your father . Don 't be afraid to go down into Egypt , for there I will make of you a great nation .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt .
these are the sons of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram , with his daughter Dinah . all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty @-@ three .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
these are the sons of Rachel , who were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
all the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt , who were his direct descendants , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were sixty @-@ six .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
Joseph prepared his chariot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Goshen . he presented himself to him , and fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
Israel said to Joseph , " Now let me die , since I have seen your face , that you are still alive . "
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Pharaoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Canaan , have come to me .
that you shall say , ' Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now , both we , and our fathers : ' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians . "
Pharaoh said to his brothers , " What is your occupation ? " they said to Pharaoh , " Your servants are shepherds , both we , and our fathers . "
they said to Pharaoh , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pasture for your servants ' flocks . for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . now therefore , please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , and said , " Give us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh , for every man of the Egyptians sold his field , because the famine was severe on them , and the land became Pharaoh 's .
only he didn 't buy the land of the priests , for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh , and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them . that is why they didn 't sell their land .
then Joseph said to the people , " Behold , I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh . behold , here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land .
they said , " You have saved our lives ! let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone didn 't become Pharaoh 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen ; and they got themselves possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @-@ seven years .
he said , " swear to me , " and he swore to him . Israel bowed himself on the bed 's head .
it happened after these things , that someone said to Joseph , " Behold , your father is sick . " he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
someone told Jacob , and said , " Behold , your son Joseph comes to you , " and Israel strengthened himself , and sat on the bed .
and said to me , ' Behold , I will make you fruitful , and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession . '
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
as for me , when I came from Paddan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath , and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath ( the same is Bethlehem ) . "
Joseph said to his father , " They are my sons , whom God has given me here . " he said , " Please bring them to me , and I will bless them . "
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he couldn 't see . he brought them near to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
Israel said to Joseph , " I didn 't think I would see your face , and behold , God has let me see your seed also . "
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . "
Israel said to Joseph , " Behold , I am dying , but God will be with you , and bring you again to the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . "
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
" Reuben , you are my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength ; excelling in dignity , and excelling in power .
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
" Judah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
Judah is a lion 's cub . from the prey , my son , you have gone up . he stooped down , he crouched as a lion , as a lioness . who will rouse him up ?
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleasant . he bows his shoulder to the burden , and becomes a servant doing forced labor .
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Almighty , who will bless you , with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies below , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb .
he instructed them , and said to them , " I am to be gathered to my people . bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place .
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
forty days were fulfilled for him , for that is how many the days it takes to embalm . the Egyptians wept for him for seventy days .
when the days of weeping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation . he mourned for his father seven days .
when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of Atad , they said , " This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians . " therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim , which is beyond the Jordan .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field , for a possession of a burial site , from Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
when Joseph 's brothers saw that their father was dead , they said , " It may be that Joseph will hate us , and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him . "
now therefore don 't be afraid . I will nourish you and your little ones . " he comforted them , and spoke kindly to them .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am dying , but God will surely visit you , and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . "
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
and they made their lives bitter with hard service , in mortar and in brick , and in all kinds of service in the field , all their service , in which they ruthlessly made them serve .
the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said to them , " Why have you done this thing , and have saved the boys alive ? "
the woman conceived , and bore a son . when she saw that he was a fine child , she hid him three months .
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
Pharaoh 's daughter came down to bathe at the river . her maidens walked along by the riverside . she saw the basket among the reeds , and sent her handmaid to get it .
then his sister said to Pharaoh 's daughter , " Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for you ? "
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
he said , " Who made you a prince and a judge over us ? do you plan to kill me , as you killed the Egyptian ? " Moses was afraid , and said , " Surely this thing is known . "
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
he said to his daughters , " Where is he ? why is it that you have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread . "
the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush . he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
Moses said , " I will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt . "
when Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see , God called to him out of the midst of the bush , and said , " Moses ! Moses ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Yahweh said , " I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters , for I know their sorrows .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
Moses said to God , " Behold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fathers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and tell them , ' Yahweh , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , has appeared to me , saying , " I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt ;
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jewels of silver , jewels of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall plunder the Egyptians . "
Moses answered , " But , behold , they will not believe me , nor listen to my voice ; for they will say , ' Yahweh has not appeared to you . ' "
he said , " Throw it on the ground . " he threw it on the ground , and it became a snake ; and Moses ran away from it .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand , and take it by the tail . " he stretched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a rod in his hand .
" that they may believe that Yahweh , the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has appeared to you . "
Yahweh said to him , " Who made man 's mouth ? or who makes one mute , or deaf , or seeing , or blind ? isn 't it I , Yahweh ?
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a donkey , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
Yahweh said to Moses , " When you go back into Egypt , see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand , but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go .
and I have said to you , " Let my son go , that he may serve me " ; and you have refused to let him go . behold , I will kill your son , your firstborn . ' "
it happened on the way at a lodging place , that Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him .
then Zipporah took a flint , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet ; and she said , " Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me . "
so he let him alone . then she said , " You are a bridegroom of blood , " because of the circumcision .
Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him , and all the signs with which he had instructed him .
the people believed , and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Pharaoh , " This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
Pharaoh said , " Who is Yahweh , that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go ? I don 't know Yahweh , and moreover I will not let Israel go . "
they said , " The God of the Hebrews has met with us . please let us go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Yahweh , our God , lest he fall on us with pestilence , or with the sword . "
the king of Egypt said to them , " Why do you , Moses and Aaron , take the people from their work ? get back to your burdens ! "
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
no straw is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Make brick ! ' and behold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
but he said , " You are idle ! you are idle ! therefore you say , ' Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh . '
and they said to them , " May Yahweh look at you , and judge , because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to kill us . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh , for by a strong hand he shall let them go , and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land . "
I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
" go in , speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land . "
Moses spoke before Yahweh , saying , " Behold , the children of Israel haven 't listened to me . how then shall Pharaoh listen to me , who am of uncircumcised lips ? "
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
the sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . these are the families of the Levites according to their generations .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Yahweh said , " Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
Moses said before Yahweh , " Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh listen to me ? "
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
go to Pharaoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand .
you shall tell him , ' Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , has sent me to you , saying , " Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : " and behold , until now you haven 't listened .
thus says Yahweh , " In this you shall know that I am Yahweh . behold , I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
Moses and Aaron did so , as Yahweh commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , " This is what Yahweh says , ' Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the frogs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , " entreat Yahweh , that he take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may sacrifice to Yahweh . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your rod , and strike the dust of the earth , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt . ' "
they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and struck the dust of the earth , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
then the magicians said to Pharaoh , " This is the finger of God : " and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; behold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth .
I will put a division between my people and your people : by tomorrow shall this sign be . " ' "
Yahweh did so ; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies .
Pharaoh said , " I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness , only you shall not go very far away . pray for me . "
Moses said , " Behold , I go out from you , and I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , tomorrow ; only don 't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh . "
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
then Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron , " Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh . the thunders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh 's .
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go , just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their midst ,
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yahweh . "
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh . "
not so ! go now you who are men , and serve Yahweh ; for that is what you desire ! " they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste , and he said , " I have sinned against Yahweh your God , and against you .
now therefore please forgive my sin again , and pray to Yahweh your God , that he may also take away from me this death . "
but Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go .
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
Moses said , " You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God .
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
but against any of the children of Israel a dog won 't even bark or move its tongue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Pharaoh won 't listen to you , that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt . "
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh , and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
Don 't eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Yahweh .
the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you , when I strike the land of Egypt .
this day shall be to you for a memorial , and you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh : throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever .
" ' seven days you shall eat unleavened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leavened , that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said to them , " Draw out , and take lambs according to your families , and kill the Passover .
for Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lintel , and on the two doorposts , Yahweh will pass over the door , and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it happened at midnight , that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in haste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . they despoiled the Egyptians .
the children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot who were men , besides children .
Moses said to the people , " Remember this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place . no leavened bread shall be eaten .
seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh .
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth ; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt .
" it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , as he swore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons .
it shall be for a sign on your hand , and for symbols between your eyes : for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt . "
it happened , when Pharaoh had let the people go , that God didn 't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , " Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war , and they return to Egypt " ;
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swear , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you . "
Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and he will follow after them ; and I will get honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies ; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh . " they did so .
it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled ; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people , and they said , " What is this we have done , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? "
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over all of them .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
they said to Moses , " Because there were no graves in Egypt , have you taken us away to die in the wilderness ? why have you treated us this way , to bring us out of Egypt ?
Moses said to the people , " Don 't be afraid . stand still , and see the salvation of Yahweh , which he will work for you today : for the Egyptians whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground .
I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies , over his chariots , and over his horsemen .
the angel of God , who went before the camp of Israel , moved and went behind them ; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them , and stood behind them .
it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel ; and there was the cloud and the darkness , yet gave it light by night : and the one didn 't come near the other all the night .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
he took off their chariot wheels , and they drove them heavily ; so that the Egyptians said , " Let 's flee from the face of Israel , for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians ! "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the sea , that the waters may come again on the Egyptians , on their chariots , and on their horsemen . "
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
your right hand , Yahweh , is glorious in power . your right hand , Yahweh , dashes the enemy in pieces .
in the greatness of your excellency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stubble .
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Yahweh , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea .
Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances .
Miriam answered them , " Sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea . "
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
then he cried to Yahweh . Yahweh showed him a tree , and he threw it into the waters , and the waters were made sweet . there he made a statute and an ordinance for them , and there he tested them ;
they took their journey from Elim , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
and in the morning , then you shall see the glory of Yahweh ; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh . who are we , that you murmur against us ? "
Moses said to Aaron , " Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel , ' Come near before Yahweh , for he has heard your murmurings . ' "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the frost on the ground .
when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , " What is it ? " for they didn 't know what it was . Moses said to them , " It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat . "
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one , and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it didn 't become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
Moses said , " Eat that today , for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh . today you shall not find it in the field .
behold , because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
Moses said to Aaron , " Take a pot , and put an Omer @-@ full of manna in it , and lay it up before Yahweh , to be kept throughout your generations . "
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
all the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
therefore the people quarreled with Moses , and said , " Give us water to drink . " Moses said to them , " Why do you quarrel with me ? why do you test Yahweh ? "
the people were thirsty for water there ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
behold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
Moses said to Joshua , " Choose men for us , and go out , fight with Amalek . tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God 's rod in my hand . "
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
now Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , received Zipporah , Moses ' wife , after he had sent her away ,
and her two sons . the name of one son was Gershom , for Moses said , " I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land . "
the name of the other was Eliezer , for he said , " My father 's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh 's sword . "
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped , at the Mountain of God .
he said to Moses , " I , your father @-@ in @-@ law Jethro , have come to you with your wife , and her two sons with her . "
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro said , " Blessed be Yahweh , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
when Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law saw all that he did to the people , he said , " What is this thing that you do for the people ? why do you sit alone , and all the people stand around you from morning to evening ? "
Moses said to his father @-@ in @-@ law , " Because the people come to me to inquire of God .
when they have a matter , they come to me , and I judge between a man and his neighbor , and I make them know the statutes of God , and his laws . "
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
all the people answered together , and said , " All that Yahweh has spoken we will do . " Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Behold , I come to you in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with you , and may also believe you forever . " Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh .
and be ready against the third day ; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai .
you shall set bounds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don 't go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death .
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet ; and all the people who were in the camp trembled .
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain .
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
Moses said to Yahweh , " The people can 't come up to Mount Sinai , for you warned us , saying , ' Set bounds around the mountain , and sanctify it . ' "
Yahweh said to him , " Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don 't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh , lest he break forth on them . "
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day ; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day , and made it holy .
" you shall not covet your neighbor 's house . you shall not covet your neighbor 's wife , nor his male servant , nor his female servant , nor his ox , nor his donkey , nor anything that is your neighbor 's . "
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
" if you buy a Hebrew servant , he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything .
but if the servant shall plainly say , ' I love my master , my wife , and my children . I will not go out free ; '
then his master shall bring him to God , and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost , and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl , and he shall serve him for ever .
" if a man sells his daughter to be a female servant , she shall not go out as the male servants do .
if a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him , you shall take him from my altar , that he may die .
" if men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone , or with his fist , and he doesn 't die , but is confined to bed ;
" if a man strikes his servant 's eye , or his maid 's eye , and destroys it , he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if the bull Gores a male servant or a female servant , thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master , and the ox shall be stoned .
" if a man opens a pit , or if a man digs a pit and doesn 't cover it , and a bull or a donkey falls into it ,
" if one man 's bull injures another 's , so that it dies , then they shall sell the live bull , and divide its price ; and they shall also divide the dead animal .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of GORING in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
if the thief is found breaking in , and is struck so that he dies , there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
if the thief isn 't found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
" you shall not wrong an alien , neither shall you oppress him , for you were aliens in the land of Egypt .
and my wrath will grow hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
" you shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses . " you shall give the firstborn of your sons to me .
you shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep . seven days it shall be with its mother , then on the eighth day you shall give it to me .
" you shall be holy men to me , therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field . you shall cast it to the dogs .
" you shall not follow a crowd to do evil ; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice ;
" if you meet your enemy 's ox or his donkey going astray , you shall surely bring it back to him again .
if you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under his burden , don 't leave him , you shall surely help him with it .
but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow , that the poor of your people may eat ; and what they leave the animal of the field shall eat . in the same way , you shall deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don 't invoke the name of other gods , neither let them be heard out of your mouth .
and the feast of harvest , the first fruits of your labors , which you sow in the field : and the feast of harvest , at the end of the year , when you gather in your labors out of the field .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread , neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning .
" behold , I send an angel before you , to keep you by the way , and to bring you into the place which I have prepared .
but if you indeed listen to his voice , and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy to your enemies , and an adversary to your adversaries .
for my angel shall go before you , and bring you in to the Amorite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Canaanite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; and I will cut them off .
you shall serve Yahweh your God , and he will bless your bread and your water , and I will take sickness away from your midst .
I will not drive them out from before you in one year , lest the land become desolate , and the animals of the field multiply against you .
he said to Moses , " Come up to Yahweh , you , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship from a distance .
Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh , and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do . "
Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh , and rose up early in the morning , and built an altar under the mountain , and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel .
he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Yahweh has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Come up to me on the mountain , and stay here , and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written , that you may teach them . "
he said to the elders , " Wait here for us , until we come again to you . behold , Aaron and Hur are with you . whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them . "
the glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days . the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up on the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .
" speak to the children of Israel , that they take an offering for me . from everyone whose heart makes him willing you shall take my offering .
according to all that I show you , the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all of its furniture , even so you shall make it .

it is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever ; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed . ' "
Aaron said to them , " Take off the golden rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . "
all the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears , and brought them to Aaron .
he received what they handed him , and fashioned it with an engraving tool , and made it a molten calf ; and they said , " These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
they rose up early on the next day , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " Go , get down ; for your people , who you brought up out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves !
now therefore leave me alone , that my wrath may burn hot against them , and that I may consume them ; and I will make of you a great nation . "
Moses turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand ; tablets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
the tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , engraved on the tables .
he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it with fire , ground it to powder , and scattered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
Aaron said , " Don 't let the anger of my lord grow hot . you know the people , that they are set on evil .
for they said to me , ' Make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
I said to them , ' Whoever has any gold , let them take it off : ' so they gave it to me ; and I threw it into the fire , and out came this calf . "
Moses said , " consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh , yes , every man against his son , and against his brother ; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day . "
Moses returned to Yahweh , and said , " Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made themselves gods of gold .
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . behold , my angel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " Depart , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . '
it happened that when Moses went out to the Tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Moses , until he had gone into the Tent .
it happened , when Moses entered into the Tent , that the pillar of cloud descended , stood at the door of the Tent , and spoke with Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , a young man , didn 't depart out of the Tent .
he said , " My presence will go with you , and I will give you rest . "
then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back ; but my face shall not be seen . "
be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai , and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain .
he chiseled two tablets of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount Sinai , as Yahweh had commanded him , and took in his hand two stone tablets .
Yahweh passed by before him , and proclaimed , " Yahweh ! Yahweh , a merciful and gracious God , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness and truth ,
keeping loving kindness for thousands , forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the children 's children , on the third and on the fourth generation . "
he said , " If now I have found favor in your sight , Lord , please let the Lord go in the midst of us ; although this is a stiff @-@ necked people ; pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for your inheritance . "
observe that which I command you this day . behold , I drive out before you the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
be careful , lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a snare in the midst of you :
" you shall keep the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt .
the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb : and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck . all the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem . no one shall appear before me empty .
" six days you shall work , but on the seventh day you shall rest : in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Write you these words : for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel . "
he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights ; he neither ate bread , nor drank water . he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
afterward all the children of Israel came near , and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
but when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
the children of Israel saw Moses ' face , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
'Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you , a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh : whoever does any work in it shall be put to death .
and the altar of incense with its poles , the anointing oil , the sweet incense , the screen for the door , at the door of the tabernacle ;

they came , both men and women , as many as were willing @-@ hearted , and brought brooches , earrings , signet rings , and armlets , all jewels of gold ; even every man who offered an offering of gold to Yahweh .
Moses said to the children of Israel , " Behold , Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah .
in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship .
he has put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Oholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
" Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise @-@ hearted man , in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that Yahweh has commanded . "
Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab , and every wise @-@ hearted man , in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom , even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it :
and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , with which to make it . they brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning .
they spoke to Moses , saying , " The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make . "
Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , " Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary . " so the people were restrained from bringing .
all the wise @-@ hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains ; of fine twined linen , blue , purple , and scarlet , with cherubim , the work of the skillful workman , they made them .

when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward , throughout all their journeys ;

Moses said to Aaron , " Draw near to the altar , and offer your sin offering , and your burnt offering , and make atonement for yourself , and for the people ; and offer the offering of the people , and make atonement for them ; as Yahweh commanded . "
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the cover from the liver of the sin offering , he burned upon the altar ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .

the waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place , you , and your sons , and your daughters with you : for they are given as your portion , and your sons ' portion , out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel .
Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burned : and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar , the sons of Aaron who were left , saying ,
" why haven 't you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary , since it is most holy , and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before Yahweh ?
behold , its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary : you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary , as I commanded . "
Aaron spoke to Moses , " Behold , this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh ; and such things as these have happened to me : and if I had eaten the sin offering today , would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh ? "

" ' when you reap the harvest of your land , you shall not wholly reap into the corners of your field , neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest : you shall leave them for the poor , and for the foreigner . I am Yahweh your God . ' "
you shall do no kind of work in that same day ; for it is a day of atonement , to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God .
you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year : it is a statute forever throughout your generations ; you shall keep it in the seventh month .
you shall dwell in booths seven days . all who are native @-@ born in Israel shall dwell in booths ,
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt . I am Yahweh your God . ' "
" command the children of Israel , that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light , to cause a lamp to burn continually .
outside of the veil of the Testimony , in the Tent of Meeting , shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations .
" you shall take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes of it : two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake .
you shall put pure frankincense on each row , that it may be to the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually . it is on the behalf of the children of Israel an everlasting covenant .

" bring out of the camp him who cursed ; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp , and stoned him with stones . the children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land which I give you , then the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh .
six years you shall sow your field , and six years you shall prune your vineyard , and gather in its fruits ;
but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land , a Sabbath to Yahweh . you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard .
what grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap , and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather . it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land .
the Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you ; for yourself , for your servant , for your maid , for your hired servant , and for your stranger , who lives as a foreigner with you .
" ' you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years , seven times seven years ; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years , even forty @-@ nine years .

you shall make the fiftieth year holy , and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants . it shall be a jubilee to you ; and each of you shall return to his own property , and each of you shall return to his family .
for it is a jubilee ; it shall be holy to you . you shall eat of its increase out of the field .
according to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor . according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you .
according to the length of the years you shall increase its price , and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price ; for he is selling the number of the crops to you .
" ' therefore you shall do my statutes , and keep my ordinances and do them ; and you shall dwell in the land in safety .
then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years .
you shall sow the eighth year , and eat of the fruits , the old store ; until the ninth year , until its fruits come in , you shall eat the old store .
then let him reckon the years since its sale , and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it ; and he shall return to his property .
" ' if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold . for a full year he shall have the right of redemption .
if it isn 't redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it , throughout his generations . it shall not be released in the Jubilee .
but the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall be released in the Jubilee .
the Levites may redeem the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , and it shall be released in the Jubilee ; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
" ' if your brother has become poor , and his hand can 't support him among you ; then you shall uphold him . he shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
" ' if your brother has grown poor among you , and sells himself to you ; you shall not make him to serve as a slave .
as a hired servant , and as a temporary resident , he shall be with you ; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee :
" ' as for your male and your female slaves , whom you may have ; of the nations that are around you , from them you may buy male and female slaves .
" ' if an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich , and your brother beside him has grown poor , and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you , or to a member of the stranger 's family ;
if he isn 't redeemed by these means , then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee , he , and his children with him .
for to me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt . I am Yahweh your God .
" ' you shall make for yourselves no idols , neither shall you raise up an engraved image or a pillar , neither shall you place any figured stone in your land , to bow down to it : for I am Yahweh your God .
then I will give you your rains in their season , and the land shall yield its increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand ; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that you should not be their slaves ; and I have broken the bars of your yoke , and made you go upright .
" ' but if you will not listen to me , and will not do all these commandments ;
I also will do this to you : I will appoint terror over you , even consumption and fever , that shall consume the eyes , and make the soul to pine away ; and you will sow your seed in vain , for your enemies will eat it .
and your strength will be spent in vain ; for your land won 't yield its increase , neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit .
" ' if you walk contrary to me , and won 't listen to me , then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins .
I will send the wild animals among you , which will rob you of your children , destroy your livestock , and make you few in number ; and your roads will become desolate .
I will bring a sword upon you , that will execute the vengeance of the covenant ; and you will be gathered together within your cities : and I will send the pestilence among you ; and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
then I will walk contrary to you in wrath ; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins .
I will destroy your high places , and cut down your incense altars , and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols ; and my soul will abhor you .
as long as it lies desolate it shall have rest , even the rest which it didn 't have in your sabbaths , when you lived on it .
I also walked contrary to them , and brought them into the land of their enemies : if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled , and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity ;
then I will remember my covenant with Jacob ; and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham ; and I will remember the land .
the land also will be left by them , and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them : and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity ; because , even because they rejected my ordinances , and their soul abhorred my statutes .
" ' if it is an animal , of which men offer an offering to Yahweh , all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy .
if it is any unclean animal , of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh , then he shall set the animal before the priest ;
" ' when a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh , then the priest shall evaluate it , whether it is good or bad : as the priest shall evaluate it , so shall it stand .
but if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee , then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee ; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation .
if he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it , and it shall remain his .
if he will not redeem the field , or if he has sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more ;
but the field , when it goes out in the Jubilee , shall be holy to Yahweh , as a field devoted ; it shall be owned by the priests .
then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee ; and he shall give your valuation on that day , as a holy thing to Yahweh .
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the Tent of Meeting , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
from twenty years old and upward , all who are able to go out to war in Israel . you and Aaron shall number them by their divisions .
they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month ; and they declared their ancestry by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , one by one .
the children of Reuben , Israel 's firstborn , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , one by one , every male from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
these are those who were numbered , whom Moses and Aaron numbered , and the princes of Israel , being twelve men : they were each one for his fathers ' house .
so all those who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers ' houses , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war in Israel ;
" only the tribe of Levi you shall not number , neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel ;
when the tabernacle is to move , the Levites shall take it down ; and when the tabernacle is to be set up , the Levites shall set it up . the stranger who comes near shall be put to death .
but the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony , that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of the Testimony . "

every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they present to the priest , shall be his .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them : ' if any man 's wife goes astray , and is unfaithful to him ,
and the spirit of jealousy comes on him , and he is jealous of his wife , and she is defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy comes on him , and he is jealous of his wife , and she isn 't defiled :

it happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle , and had anointed it and sanctified it , with all its furniture , and the altar with all its vessels , and had anointed and sanctified them ;
and they brought their offering before Yahweh , six covered wagons , and twelve oxen ; a wagon for every two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they presented them before the tabernacle .
and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari , according to their service , under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but to the sons of Kohath he gave none , because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them ; they carried it on their shoulders .
the princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes gave their offerings before the altar .
Yahweh said to Moses , " They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedication of the altar . "
he who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah ,
and his offering was : one silver platter , the weight of which was one hundred thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering ;
he offered for his offering : one silver platter , the weight of which was one hundred thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering ;
one young bull , one ram , one male lamb a year old , for a burnt offering ;

this was the dedication of the altar , on the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve silver platters , twelve silver bowls , twelve golden ladles ;
the twelve golden ladles , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; all the gold of the ladles weighed one hundred twenty shekels ;
all the cattle for the burnt offering twelve bulls , the rams twelve , the male lambs a year old twelve , and their meal offering ; and the male goats for a sin offering twelve ;
when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh , he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony , from between the two cherubim : and he spoke to him .
" speak to Aaron , and tell him , ' When you light the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand . ' "
Aaron did so . he lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lampstand , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
this was the workmanship of the lampstand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand .
you shall do this to them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of cleansing on them , let them shave their whole bodies with a razor , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves .
" after that , the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting : and you shall cleanse them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for myself .
Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so the children of Israel did to them .
the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh ; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them .
after that , the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron , and before his sons : as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so they did to them .
but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
on the fourteenth day of this month , at evening , you shall keep it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes , and according to all its ordinances , you shall keep it . "
they kept the Passover in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , at evening , in the wilderness of Sinai . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were unclean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
those men said to him , " We are unclean because of the dead body of a man . why are we kept back , that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? "
" say to the children of Israel , ' If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body , or is on a journey far away , he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh .
in the second month , on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it ; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it .
whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent , then after that the children of Israel traveled ; and in the place where the cloud remained , there the children of Israel encamped .
sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle ; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped , and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled .
sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning ; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning , they traveled : or by day and by night , when the cloud was taken up , they traveled .
whether it was two days , or a month , or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle , remaining on it , the children of Israel remained encamped , and didn 't travel ; but when it was taken up , they traveled .
at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped , and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled . they kept Yahweh 's command , at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .
when you blow an alarm the second time , the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward . they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
" the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets . this shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations .
when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you , then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets . then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God , and you will be saved from your enemies .
the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies . Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army .
the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies . Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
Moses said to Hobab , the son of Reuel the Midianite , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , " We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said , ' I will give it to you . ' come with us , and we will treat you well ; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel . "
he said to him , " I will not go ; but I will depart to my own land , and to my relatives . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days ' journey . the ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the ark went forward , that Moses said , " Rise up , Yahweh , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh . when Yahweh heard it , his anger was kindled ; and Yahweh 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly : and the children of Israel also wept again , and said , " Who will give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
but now we have lost our appetite . there is nothing at all except this manna to look at . "
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in mortars , and boiled it in pots , and made cakes of it . its taste was like the taste of fresh oil .
Moses said to Yahweh , " Why have you treated with your servant so badly ? why haven 't I found favor in your sight , that you lay the burden of all this people on me ?
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they weep to me , saying , ' Give us meat , that we may eat . '
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don 't let me see my wretchedness . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spirit which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yourself alone .
Moses said , " The people , among whom I am , are six hundred thousand men on foot ; and you have said , ' I will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month . '
Yahweh said to Moses , " Has Yahweh 's hand grown short ? now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not . "
a wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cubits above the surface of the earth .
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the quails . he who gathered least gathered ten homers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people , and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague .
Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses , to Aaron , and to Miriam , " You three come out to the Tent of Meeting ! " the three of them came out .
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the Tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forward .
he said , " Hear now my words . if there is a prophet among you , I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .
with him I will speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in riddles ; and he shall see Yahweh 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ? "
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
they came to the valley of Eshcol , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , " Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it . "
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said to them , " Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who spied out the land , tore their clothes :
only don 't rebel against Yahweh , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Yahweh is with us . Don 't fear them . "
but all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Yahweh appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
Yahweh said to Moses , " How long will this people despise me ? and how long will they not believe in me , for all the signs which I have worked among them ?
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
tell them , ' As I live , says Yahweh , surely as you have spoken in my ears , so will I do to you :
your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness ; and all who were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , who have murmured against me ,
surely you shall not come into the land , concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
after the number of the days in which you spied out the land , even forty days , for every day a year , you will bear your iniquities , even forty years , and you will know my alienation . '
I , Yahweh , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , " Behold , we are here , and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised : for we have sinned . "
Moses said , " Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh , since it shall not prosper ?
then the Amalekite came down , and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain , and struck them and beat them down , even to Hormah .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habitations , which I give to you ,
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a Hin of oil :
when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or for peace offerings to Yahweh ;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a Hin of oil :
if a stranger lives as a foreigner with you , or whoever may be among you throughout your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh ; as you do , so he shall do .
for the assembly , there shall be one statute for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner , a statute forever throughout your generations : as you are , so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh .
one law and one ordinance shall be for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you . ' "
the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and they shall be forgiven ; for it was an error , and they have brought their offering , an offering made by fire to Yahweh , and their sin offering before Yahweh , for their error :
" ' if one person sins unwittingly , then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering .
the priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs , when he sins unwittingly , before Yahweh , to make atonement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
you shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly , for him who is native @-@ born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them .
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue :
and they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred fifty princes of the congregation , called to the assembly , men of renown ;
and put fire in them , and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow : and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses , he shall be holy . you have gone too far , you sons of Levi ! "
is it a small thing to you , that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself , to do the service of the tabernacle of Yahweh , and to stand before the congregation to minister to them ;
and that he has brought you near , and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you ? and do you seek the priesthood also ?
therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh : and Aaron , what is he that you murmur against him ? "
Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab ; and they said , " We won 't come up :
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
moreover you haven 't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : will you put out the eyes of these men ? we won 't come up . "
Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation .
" separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment ! "
they fell on their faces , and said , " God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and will you be angry with all the congregation ? "
he spoke to the congregation , saying , " Depart , please , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest you be consumed in all their sins ! "
so they went away from the tent of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood at the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little ones .
but if Yahweh make a new thing , and the ground open its mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain to them , and they go down alive into Sheol ; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh . "
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who appertained to Korah , and all their goods .
so they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into Sheol : and the earth closed on them , and they perished from among the assembly .
Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers , which those who were burnt had offered ; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar ,
it happened , when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Yahweh appeared .
Moses said to Aaron , " Take your censer , and put fire from off the altar in it , and lay incense on it , and carry it quickly to the congregation , and make atonement for them ; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh ! the plague has begun . "
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the incense , and made atonement for the people .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .
you shall write Aaron 's name on the rod of Levi ; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers ' houses .
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion ; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me , that they not die . "
everyone who comes near , who comes near to the tabernacle of Yahweh , dies ! will we all perish ? "
your brothers also , the tribe of Levi , the tribe of your father , bring near with you , that they may be joined to you , and minister to you : but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony .
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the Tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
they shall be joined to you , and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting , for all the service of the Tent : and a stranger shall not come near to you .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Yahweh , to do the service of the Tent of Meeting .
you shall eat of it like the most holy things . every male shall eat of it . it shall be holy to you .
everything that opens the womb , of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh , both of man and animal shall be yours : nevertheless you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man , and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals .
you shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old , according to your estimation , for five shekels of money , after the shekel of the sanctuary ( the same is twenty gerahs ) .
their flesh shall be yours , as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh , it shall be yours .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
" to the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the Tent of Meeting .
but the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
" moreover you shall speak to the Levites , and tell them , ' When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh , a tithe of the tithe .
thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes , which you receive of the children of Israel ; and of it you shall give Yahweh 's wave offering to Aaron the priest .
you shall eat it in every place , you and your households : for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting .
" this is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded : speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red heifer without spot , in which is no blemish , and which was never yoked .
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times .
one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the evening .
he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening : and it shall be to the children of Israel , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them , for a statute forever .
the same shall purify himself with water on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he doesn 't purify himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
" whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify him ; and he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at evening .
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month : and the people stayed in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them .
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock , and he said to them , " Hear now , you rebels ; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you ? "
and when we cried to Yahweh , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth out of Egypt : and behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of your border .
Edom said to him , " You shall not pass through me , lest I come out with the sword against you . "
he said , " You shall not pass through . " Edom came out against him with many people , and with a strong hand .
they traveled from Kadesh : and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came to Mount Hor .
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah .
when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they wept for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them captive .
Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities . "
the people spoke against God , and against Moses , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there is no bread , and there is no water ; and our soul loathes this light bread . "
Moses made a serpent of brass , and set it on the standard : and it happened , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he looked to the serpent of brass , he lived .
from there they traveled to Beer : that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses , " Gather the people together , and I will give them water . "
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looks down on the desert .
" let me pass through your land : we will not turn aside into field , or into vineyard ; we will not drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king 's highway , until we have passed your border . "
Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Jahaz ; and he fought against Israel .
Israel struck him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , even to the children of Ammon ; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even to the Arnon .
we have shot at them . Heshbon has perished even to Dibon . we have laid waste even to Nophah , Which reaches to Medeba . "
they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Don 't fear him : for I have delivered him into your hand , and all his people , and his land ; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon . "
Moab said to the elders of Midian , " Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us , as the ox licks up the grass of the field . " Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time .
the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came to Balaam , and spoke to him the words of Balak .
he said to them , " Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as Yahweh shall speak to me . " the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
'Behold , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the surface of the earth : now , come curse me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
God said to Balaam , " You shall not go with them . you shall not curse the people ; for they are blessed . "
Balaam rose up in the morning , and said to the princes of Balak , " Go to your land ; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you . "
they came to Balaam , and said to him , " Thus says Balak the son of Zippor , ' Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me :
for I will promote you to very great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . please come therefore , and curse this people for me . ' "
God came to Balaam at night , and said to him , " If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . "
God 's anger was kindled because he went ; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the donkey turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam struck the donkey , to turn her into the way .
then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she lay down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , " What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? "
the donkey said to Balaam , " Am I not your donkey , on which you have ridden all your life long to this day ? was I ever in the habit of doing so to you ? " he said , " No . "
then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
when Balak heard that Balaam had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Moab , which is on the border of the Arnon , which is in the utmost part of the border .
Balak said to Balaam , " didn 't I earnestly send to you to call you ? why didn 't you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? "
Balaam said to Balak , " Behold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . "
God met Balaam : and he said to him , " I have prepared the seven altars , and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar . "
Yahweh put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , " Return to Balak , and thus you shall speak . "
who can count the dust of Jacob , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous ! let my last end be like his ! "
Balak said to him , " Please come with me to another place , where you may see them ; you shall see but the utmost part of them , and shall not see them all : and curse me them from there . "
he came to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . Balak said to him , " What has Yahweh spoken ? "
he took up his parable , and said , " Rise up , Balak , and hear ! listen to me , you son of Zippor .
surely there is no enchantment with Jacob ; Neither is there any divination with Israel . now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What has God done !
Balak said to Balaam , " Come now , I will take you to another place ; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there . "
when Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel , he didn 't go , as at the other times , to meet with enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came on him .
water shall flow from his buckets . his seed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than Agag . his kingdom shall be exalted .
Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he struck his hands together ; and Balak said to Balaam , " I called you to curse my enemies , and , behold , you have altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee you to your place ! I thought to promote you to great honor ; but , behold , Yahweh has kept you back from honor . "
he took up his parable , and said , " Balaam the son of Beor says , the man whose eye was closed says ;
he looked at Amalek , and took up his parable , and said , " Amalek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods ; and the people ate , and bowed down to their gods .
Moses said to the judges of Israel , " Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor . "
and it shall be to him , and to his seed after him , the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was jealous for his God , and made atonement for the children of Israel . ' "
it happened after the plague , that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , saying ,
the sons of Eliab : Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . these are that Dathan and Abiram , who were called of the congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against Yahweh ,
these are those who were numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
notwithstanding , the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , who was born to Levi in Egypt : and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
those who were numbered of them were twenty @-@ three thousand , every male from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
for Yahweh had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . there was not left a man of them , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter .
if his father has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute and ordinance , as Yahweh commanded Moses . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go up into this mountain of Abarim , and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel .
" let Yahweh , the God of the spirits of all flesh , appoint a man over the congregation ,
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
you shall put of your honor on him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' My offering , my food for my offerings made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to me , you shall observe to offer to me in their due season . '
with the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with the fourth part of a Hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
the other lamb you shall offer at evening : as the meal offering of the morning , and as the drink offering of it , you shall offer it , an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
" ' on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish , and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , and the drink offering of it :
this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath , besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for each bull ; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb ; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
one male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh ; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
but you shall offer an offering made by fire , a burnt offering to Yahweh : two young bulls , and one ram , and seven male lambs a year old ; they shall be to you without blemish ;
" ' also in the day of the first fruits , when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast of weeks , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no servile work ;
but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : two young bulls , one ram , seven male lambs a year old ;
besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , you shall offer them ( they shall be to you without blemish ) , and their drink offerings .
" ' in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you .
you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : one young bull , one ram , seven male lambs a year old without blemish ;
" ' on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation ; and you shall afflict your souls : you shall do no kind of work ;
but you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh for a pleasant aroma : one young bull , one ram , seven male lambs a year old ; they shall be to you without blemish ;
and one male goat for a sin offering , besides the continual burnt offering , the meal offering of it , and the drink offering of it .
" ' on the second day you shall offer twelve young bulls , two rams , fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and one male goat for a sin offering ; besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , and their drink offerings .
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
" ' on the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly : you shall do no servile work ;
" ' you shall offer these to Yahweh in your set feasts , besides your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meal offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings . ' "
Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded .
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
" but the vow of a widow , or of her who is divorced , everything with which she has bound her soul , shall stand against her .
Moses spoke to the people , saying , " Arm men from among you for the war , that they may go against Midian , to execute Yahweh 's vengeance on Midian .
so there were delivered , out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain : Evi , and Rekem , and zur , and Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their flocks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their encampments , they burnt with fire .
they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan at Jericho .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor , and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh .
" Encamp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred ; of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys , and of the flocks .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
the donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred ; of which Yahweh 's tribute was sixty @-@ one .
Moses gave the tribute , which was Yahweh 's wave offering , to Eleazar the priest , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
we have brought Yahweh 's offering , what every man has gotten , of jewels of gold , armlets , and bracelets , signet rings , earrings , and necklaces , to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh . "
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the Tent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh .
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don 't bring us over the Jordan . "
Moses said to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , " Shall your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them ?
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
" behold , you have risen up in your fathers ' place , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel .
for if you turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and you will destroy all this people . "
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
Moses said to them , " If you will do this thing , if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war ,
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
build cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth . "
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying , " Your servants will do as my lord commands .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our livestock , shall be there in the cities of Gilead ;
Moses said to them , " If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan , every man who is armed to battle , before Yahweh , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession :
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , " As Yahweh has said to your servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan . "
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
they traveled from before Hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness : and they went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and encamped in Marah .
Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
you shall take possession of the land , and dwell therein ; for I have given given the land to you to possess it .
" but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides , and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Canaan ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan according to its borders ) ,
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass along to Zin ; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea ; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar , and pass along to Azmon ;
" ' for the western border , you shall have the great sea and its border : this shall be your west border .
and the border shall go forth to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , " This is the land which you shall inherit by lot , which Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine tribes , and to the half @-@ tribe ;
these are the names of the men : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
these are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Levites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @-@ two cities .
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the Avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
or in enmity struck him with his hand , so that he died ; he who struck him shall surely be put to death ; he is a murderer : the Avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death , when he meets him .
and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the Avenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge , where he was fled : and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with the holy oil .
and the Avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the Avenger of blood kill the manslayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong : so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . "
Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Yahweh , saying , " The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right .
this is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .
for Mahlah , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married to their father 's brothers ' sons .
they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness , in the Arabah over against Suph , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give to them and to their seed after them . "
I spoke to you at that time , saying , " I am not able to bear you myself alone :
so I took the heads of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , and captains of fifties , and captains of tens , and officers , according to your tribes .
I commanded your judges at that time , saying , " Hear cases between your brothers , and judge righteously between a man and his brother , and the foreigner who is living with him .
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which Yahweh our God gives to us .
behold , Yahweh your God has set the land before you : go up , take possession , as Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has spoken to you ; don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
and you murmured in your tents , and said , " Because Yahweh hated us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
where are we going up ? our brothers have made our heart to melt , saying , ' The people are greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there . ' "
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh : he shall see it ; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on , and to his children , because he has wholly followed Yahweh . "
Joshua the son of Nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
Yahweh said to me , " Tell them , ' Don 't go up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest you be struck before your enemies . ' "
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yahweh spoke to me ; and we encircled Mount Seir many days .
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
Yahweh said to me , " Don 't bother Moab , neither contend with them in battle ; for I will not give you of his land for a possession ; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession . "
the Horites also lived in Seir before , but the children of Esau succeeded them ; and they destroyed them from before them , and lived in their place ; as Israel did to the land of his possession , which Yahweh gave to them . )
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the valley of the Arnon : behold , I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land ; begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the valley , even to Gilead , there was not a city too high for us ; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us :
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
( for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; isn 't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was its length , and four cubits its breadth , after the cubit of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and called them , even Bashan , after his own name , Havvoth Jair , to this day . )
the Arabah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
but Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and didn 't listen to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " Let it suffice you ; speak no more to me of this matter .
now , Israel , listen to the statutes and to the ordinances , which I teach you , to do them ; that you may live , and go in and possess the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , gives you .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you .
keep therefore and do them ; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples , who shall hear all these statutes , and say , " Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people . "
you came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
but Yahweh has taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be to him a people of inheritance , as at this day .
furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over the Jordan ; but you shall go over , and possess that good land .
did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as you have heard , and live ?
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , for the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , for the Manassites .
beyond the Jordan , in the valley over against Beth Peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel struck , when they came forth out of Egypt .
they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , even to Mount Sion ( the same is Hermon ) ,
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , Hear , Israel , the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day , that you may learn them , and observe to do them .
Yahweh didn 't make this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm : therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
" neither shall you covet your neighbor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neighbor 's house , his field , or his male servant , or his female servant , his ox , or his donkey , or anything that is your neighbor 's . "
these words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more . he wrote them on two tables of stone , and gave them to me .
for who is there of all flesh , that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
but as for you , stand here by me , and I will tell you all the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which you shall teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it . "
you shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
that you might fear Yahweh your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
it shall be , when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give you , great and goodly cities , which you didn 't build ,
you shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples who are around you ;
you shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he swore to our fathers .
and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you , and you shall strike them ; then you shall utterly destroy them : you shall make no covenant with them , nor show mercy to them ;
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God : Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Yahweh didn 't set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fewest of all peoples :
but because Yahweh loves you , and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers , has Yahweh brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire . you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them , nor take it for yourself , lest you be snared in it ; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
it shall be , if you shall forget Yahweh your God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish .
hear , Israel : you are to pass over the Jordan this day , to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself , cities great and fortified up to the sky ,
remember , don 't forget , how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebellious against Yahweh .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
Yahweh said to me , " Arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image . "
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sinned against Yahweh your God ; you had made yourselves a molten calf : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you . but Yahweh listened to me that time also .
when Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea , saying , " Go up and possess the land which I have given you " ; then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God , and you didn 't believe him , nor listen to his voice .
I prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , don 't destroy your people and your inheritance , that you have redeemed through your greatness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yahweh gave them to me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
at that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , to stand before Yahweh to minister to him , and to bless in his name , to this day .
Yahweh said to me , " Arise , take your journey before the people ; and they shall go in and possess the land , which I swore to their fathers to give to them . "
for Yahweh your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who doesn 't respect persons , nor takes reward .
you shall fear Yahweh your God ; you shall serve him ; and you shall cling to him , and you shall swear by his name .
know this day : for I don 't speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his outstretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them , as the days of the heavens above the earth .
for if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Yahweh your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on , as he has spoken to you .
and the curse , if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which you have not known .
these are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Asherim with fire ; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
only you shall not eat the blood ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
only be sure that you don 't eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh .
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
you shall walk after Yahweh your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and you shall serve him , and cling to him .
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you .
certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you , and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city , saying , " Let us go and serve other gods , " which you have not known ;
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
the hart , and the gazelle , and the Roebuck , and the wild goat , and the ibex , and the antelope , and the chamois .
nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud , or of those who have the hoof cloven : the camel , and the hare , and the rabbit ; because they chew the cud but don 't part the hoof , they are unclean to you .
but these are they of which you shall not eat : the eagle , and the vulture , and the osprey ,
you shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your needy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
then you shall take an awl , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
you shall eat it within your gates : the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gazelle , and as the hart .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
six days you shall eat unleavened bread . on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God ; you shall do no work .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress :
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Levite , and the foreigner , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within your gates .
you shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God , in Transgressing his covenant ,
and has gone and served other gods , and worshiped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not commanded ;
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire diligently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in Israel ,
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Yahweh has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
this is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
when a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh , if the thing doesn 't follow , nor happen , that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken : the prophet has spoken it presumptuously , you shall not be afraid of him .
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
you shall prepare you the way , and divide the borders of your land , which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , into three parts , that every manslayer may flee there .
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there , and deliver him into the hand of the Avenger of blood , that he may die .
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
those who remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , chariots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yahweh your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall tell them , " Hear , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don 't let your heart faint ; don 't be afraid , nor tremble , neither be scared of them ;
for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you . "
what man is there who has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but you shall utterly destroy them : the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , and the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; as Yahweh your God has commanded you ;
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated ;
but he shall acknowledge the firstborn , the son of the hated , by giving him a double portion of all that he has ; for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they chasten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
you shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
and the young lady 's father shall tell the elders , " I gave my daughter to this man to wife , and he hates her ;
and behold , he has accused her of shameful things , saying , ' I didn 't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity ; ' and yet these are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity . " they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
he who is wounded in the stones , or has his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
a bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever :
you shall not abhor an Edomite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abhor an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleases him best : you shall not oppress him .
there shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel , neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God , a freewill offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
you shall not deprive the foreigner , or the fatherless of justice , nor take a widow 's clothing in pledge ;
but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you reap your harvest in your field , and have forgot a sheaf in the field , you shall not go again to get it : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow ; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
if there is a controversy between men , and they come to judgment , and the judges judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked ;
it shall be , that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blotted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don 't want to take her " ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
therefore it shall be , when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around , in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it , that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky ; you shall not forget .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I profess this day to Yahweh your God , that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us . "
you shall answer and say before Yahweh your God , " A Syrian ready to perish was my father ; and he went down into Egypt , and lived there , few in number ; and he became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous .
and we cried to Yahweh , the God of our fathers , and Yahweh heard our voice , and saw our affliction , and our toil , and our oppression ;
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yahweh , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yahweh your God , and worship before Yahweh your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
and to make you high above all nations that he has made , in praise , and in name , and in honor ; and that you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God , as he has spoken .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
there you shall build an altar to Yahweh your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel , saying , " Keep silence , and listen , Israel : this day you have become the people of Yahweh your God .
you shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command you this day . "
" these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people , when you have passed over the Jordan : Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin .
'Cursed is the man who makes an engraved or molten image , an abomination to Yahweh , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and sets it up in secret . ' all the people shall answer and say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who the foreigner , fatherless , and widow of justice . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with his father 's wife , because he has uncovered his father 's skirt . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who doesn 't confirm the words of this law to do them . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . ' "
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself , as he has sworn to you ; if you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and walk in his ways .
Yahweh will make you plenteous for good , in the fruit of your body , and in the fruit of your livestock , and in the fruit of your ground , in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you .
Yahweh will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
Yahweh will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with blight , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
you shall become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away .
you shall carry much seed out into the field , and shall gather little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil ; for your olives shall drop off .
because you didn 't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send against you , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck , until he has destroyed you .
Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far , from the end of the earth , as the eagle flies ; a nation whose language you shall not understand ;
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Yahweh your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , Yahweh YOUR GOD ;
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Yahweh will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
it shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
these are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
you stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God ; your heads , your tribes , your elders , and your officers , even all the men of Israel ,
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick ;
even all the nations shall say , " Why has Yahweh done thus to this land ? what does the heat of this great anger mean ? "
then men shall say , " Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
the secret things belong to Yahweh our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul .
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse : therefore choose life , that you may live , you and your seed ;
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid , nor be scared of them : for Yahweh your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor forsake you . "
Yahweh , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither forsake you : Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yahweh your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
Yahweh said to Moses , " Behold , your days approach that you must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting , that I may commission him . " Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting .
Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , saying ,
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall condense as the dew , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the herb .
they have dealt corruptly with him . they are not his children , because of their defect . they are a perverse and crooked generation .
as an eagle that stirs up her nest , that flutters over her young , he spread abroad his wings , he took them , he bore them on his feathers .
but Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sleek . then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faithfulness .
for a fire is kindled in my anger , Burns to the lowest Sheol , devours the earth with its increase , and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , of the fields of Gomorrah . their grapes are grapes of gall , Their clusters are bitter .
which ate the fat of their sacrifices , And drank the wine of their drink offering ? let them rise up and help you ! let them be your protection .
" see now that I , even I , am he , There is no god with me . I kill , and I make alive . I wound , and I heal . there is no one who can deliver out of my hand .
if I whet my glittering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will recompense those who hate me .
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will avenge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make expiation for his land , for his people .
he said to them , " Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day , which you shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
" go up into this mountain of Abarim , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and see the land of Canaan , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
he was king in Jeshurun , When the heads of the people were gathered , All the tribes of Israel together .
this is for Judah . he said , " Hear , Yahweh , the voice of Judah . bring him in to his people . with his hands he contended for himself . you shall be a help against his adversaries . "
they shall teach Jacob your ordinances , and Israel your law . they shall put incense before you , and whole burnt offering on your altar .
Yahweh , bless his substance . accept the work of his hands . strike through the hips of those who rise up against him , of those who hate him , that they not rise again . "
of Benjamin he said , " The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him . he covers him all the day long . he dwells between his shoulders . "
of Naphtali he said , " Naphtali , satisfied with favor , full of the blessing of Yahweh , possess the west and the south . "
of Asher he said , " Asher is blessed with children . let him be acceptable to his brothers . let him dip his foot in oil .
" there is none like God , Jeshurun , who rides on the heavens for your help , In his excellency on the skies .
the eternal God is your dwelling place . underneath are the everlasting arms . he thrust out the enemy from before you , and said , ' Destroy ! '
you are happy , Israel . who is like you , a people saved by Yahweh , the shield of your help , the sword of your excellency ! your enemies shall submit themselves to you . you shall tread on their high places . "
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead , to Dan ,
and the South , and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees , to Zoar .
so Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of Yahweh .
the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended .
in all the signs and the wonders , which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel .
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
" remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , saying , ' Yahweh your God gives you rest , and will give you this land .
your wives , your little ones , and your livestock , shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan ; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed , all the mighty men of valor , and shall help them
whoever rebels against your commandment , and doesn 't listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of shittim as spies , saying , " Go , view the land , including Jericho . " they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab , and slept there .
the woman took the two men and hid them . then she said , " Yes , the men came to me , but I didn 't know where they came from .
and she said to the men , " I know that Yahweh has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
for we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you , when you came out of Egypt ; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon and to Og , whom you utterly destroyed .
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
now therefore , please swear to me by Yahweh , since I have dealt kindly with you , that you also will deal kindly with my father 's house , and give me a true token ;
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
she said to them , " Go to the mountain , lest the pursuers find you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers have returned . afterward , you may go your way . "
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had returned . the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but didn 't find them .
they said to Joshua , " Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land . moreover , all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us . "
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " Come here , and hear the words of Yahweh your God . "
Joshua said , " Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Hivite , and the Perizzite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Jebusite out from before you .
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people ,
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
for the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan , until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua ; and the people hurried and passed over .
about forty thousand men , ready and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle , to the plains of Jericho .
on that day , Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the east border of Jericho .
he spoke to the children of Israel , saying , " When your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ' What do these stones mean ? '
then you shall let your children know , saying , ' Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
for Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh , that it is mighty ; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever . ' "
at that time , Yahweh said to Joshua , " Make flint knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time . "
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circumcised by Joshua ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circumcising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . " therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal , to this day .
the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal . they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho .
they ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover , in the same day .
the manna ceased on the next day , after they had eaten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel didn 't have manna any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
he said , " No ; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh 's army . " Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and worshipped , and said to him , " What does my lord say to his servant ? "
the prince of Yahweh 's army said to Joshua , " Take your shoes off of your feet ; for the place on which you stand is holy . " Joshua did so .
Joshua the son of Nun called the priests , and said to them , " Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of Yahweh . "
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the dawning of the day , and marched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they marched around the city seven times .
it happened at the seventh time , when the priests blew the trumpets , Joshua said to the people , " Shout , for Yahweh has given you the city !
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things ; for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yahweh 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
the men of Ai struck about thirty @-@ six men of them , and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
Joshua tore his clothes , and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening , he and the elders of Israel ; and they put dust on their heads .
therefore the children of Israel can 't stand before their enemies . they turn their backs before their enemies , because they have become devoted for destruction . I will not be with you any more , unless you destroy the devoted things from among you .
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
Joshua said to Achan , " My son , please give glory to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and make confession to him . tell me now what you have done ! Don 't hide it from me ! "
Achan answered Joshua , and said , " I have truly sinned against Yahweh , the God of Israel , and this is what I have done .
they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day . Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger . therefore the name of that place was called " The valley of Achor " to this day .
you shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king , except its spoil and its livestock , you shall take for a plunder for yourselves . set an ambush for the city behind it . "
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to Ai . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
he commanded them , saying , " Behold , you shall lie in ambush against the city , behind the city . Don 't go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
and you shall rise up from the ambush , and take possession of the city ; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and killed the men of Ai .
all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of Ai .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua .
as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of uncut stones , on which no man had lifted up any iron . they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , and sacrificed peace offerings .
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a covenant with us . "
the men of Israel said to the Hivites , " What if you live among us . how could we make a covenant with you ? "
they said to him , " Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God ; for we have heard of his fame , all that he did in Egypt ,
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
these wineskins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel didn 't strike them , because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel . all the congregation murmured against the princes .
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Why have you deceived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now therefore you are cursed , and some of you will never fail to be bondservants , both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they didn 't kill them .
that they were very afraid , because Gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than Ai , and all its men were mighty .
" come up to me , and help me , and let us strike Gibeon ; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel . "
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace . none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
Joshua said to them , " Don 't be afraid , nor be dismayed . be strong and courageous , for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight . "
Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with all the souls who were in it , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Don 't be afraid because of them ; for tomorrow at this time , I will deliver them up all slain before Israel . you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire . "
Joshua turned back at that time , and took Hazor , and struck its king with the sword : for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breathed . he burnt Hazor with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
so Joshua captured all that land , the hill country , all the South , all the land of Goshen , the lowland , the Arabah , the hill country of Israel , and the lowland of the same ;
from Mount Halak , that goes up to Seir , even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon . he took all their kings , struck them , and put them to death .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , except the Hivites , the inhabitants of Gibeon . they took all in battle .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the Anakim from the hill country , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the hill country of Judah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
there were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , did some remain .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . the land had rest from war .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon , and all the Arabah eastward :
and the border of Og king of Bashan , of the remnant of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
and ruled in Mount Hermon , and in Salecah , and in all Bashan , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them . Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
in the hill country , and in the lowland , and in the Arabah , and in the slopes , and in the wilderness , and in the South ; the Hittite , the Amorite , and the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite :
the king of Dor in the height of Dor , one ; the king of Goiim in Gilgal , one ;
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim , even all the Sidonians ; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel didn 't drive out the Geshurites , nor the Maacathites : but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
their border was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , to Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
and in the valley , Beth Haram , Beth Nimrah , Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , the Jordan 's bank , to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward .
their border was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , sixty cities .
these are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan at Jericho , eastward .
but to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance . Yahweh , the God of Israel , is their inheritance , as he spoke to them .
by the lot of their inheritance , as Yahweh commanded by Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half @-@ tribe .
for Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half @-@ tribe beyond the Jordan ; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;
and it passed along to Azmon , went out at the brook of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . this shall be your south border .
the east border was the Salt Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward ; and the border extended to Shikkeron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out at Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
it happened , when she came , that she had him ask her father fore a field . she got off of her donkey , and Caleb said , " What do you want ? "
she said , " Give me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
the farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel , Eder , Jagur ,
as for the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah couldn 't drive them out ; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho , at the waters of Jericho on the east , even the wilderness , going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel .
and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites , to the border of Beth Horon the lower , even to Gezer ; and ended at the sea .
this was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families . the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar , to Beth Horon the upper .
the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north . the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh , and passed along it on the east of Janoah .
it went down from Janoah to Ataroth , to Naarah , reached to Jericho , and went out at the Jordan .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
they didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh , for he was the firstborn of Joseph . as for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
they came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying , " Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers . " therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .
the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , which is before Shechem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
the land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh ; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
the border went down to the brook of Kanah , southward of the brook . these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh . the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook , and ended at the sea .
yet the children of Manasseh couldn 't drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , " Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance , since I am a great people , because Yahweh has blessed me so far ? "
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land , which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you ?
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
you shall survey the land into seven parts , and bring the description here to me ; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God .
for the Levites have no portion among you ; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance . Gad , Reuben , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward , which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them . "
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward . it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven .
the border passed along from there to Luz , to the side of Luz ( the same is Bethel ) , southward . the border went down to Ataroth Addar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter southward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward ; and ended at Kiriath Baal ( the same is Kiriath jearim ) , a city of the children of Judah . this was the west quarter .
it extended northward , went out at En Shemesh , and went out to Geliloth , which is over against the ascent of Adummim . it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
Zelah , Eleph , the Jebusite ( the same is Jerusalem ) , Gibeath , and Kiriath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath Beer , Ramah of the South . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families . the border of their inheritance was to Sarid .
their border went up westward , even to Maralah , and reached to Dabbesheth . it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam .
the border turned around it on the north to Hannathon ; and it ended at the valley of Iphtah El ;
the border turned to Ramah , to the fortified city of Tyre ; and the border turned to Hosah . it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib ;
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
according to the commandment of Yahweh , they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim ; and he built the city , and lived there .
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Yahweh , these cities with their suburbs .
the rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
the children of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , out of the tribe of Asher , out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh in Bashan .
the children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben , out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun .
but they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession .
to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Libnah with its suburbs ,
all the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country of Ephraim , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Gezer with its suburbs ,
they gave to the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Be Eshterah with its suburbs ; two cities .
out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Hammothdor with its suburbs , and Kartan with its suburbs ; three cities .
to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of Gad , Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Mahanaim with its suburbs ,
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers , as he spoke to them . therefore now return and go to your tents , to the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan .
now to the one half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan ; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward . moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them ,
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh ,
didn 't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel ? that man didn 't perish alone in his iniquity . ' "
" the Mighty One , God , Yahweh , the Mighty One , God , Yahweh , he knows ; and Israel shall know : if it was in rebellion , or if in trespass against Yahweh ( don 't save us this day ) ,
for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you , you children of Reuben and children of Gad . you have no portion in Yahweh . " ' so your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh .
" far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh , and turn away this day from following Yahweh , to build an altar for burnt offering , for meal offering , or for sacrifice , besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle ! "
the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and spoke no more of going up against them to war , to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived .
that Joshua called for all Israel , for their elders and for their heads , and for their judges and for their officers , and said to them , " I am old and well advanced in years .
behold , I have allotted to you these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from the Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you , as he spoke to you .
" but if you do at all go back , and hold fast to the remnant of these nations , even these who remain among you , and make marriages with them , and go in to them , and they to you ;
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
Joshua said to all the people , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River , even Terah , the father of Abraham , and the father of Nahor : and they served other gods .
I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave to Esau Mount Seir , to possess it . Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
" now therefore fear Yahweh , and serve him in sincerity and in truth . put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River , in Egypt ; and serve Yahweh .
Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples , even the Amorites who lived in the land . therefore we also will serve Yahweh ; for he is our God . "
Joshua said to the people , " You can 't serve Yahweh ; for he is a holy God . he is a jealous God . he will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins .
Joshua said to the people , " You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves , to serve him . " they said , " We are witnesses . "
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh .
Joshua said to all the people , " Behold , this stone shall be a witness against us ; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us . it shall be therefore a witness against you , lest you deny your God . "
Judah said to Simeon his brother , " Come up with me into my lot , that we may fight against the Canaanites ; and I likewise will go with you into your lot . " so Simeon went with him .
they found Adoni @-@ Bezek in Bezek ; and they fought against him , and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the lowland .
from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir . ( now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher . )
it happened , when she came , that she got him to ask her father for a field : and she alighted from off her donkey ; and Caleb said to her , " What would you like ? "
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel . ( now the name of the city before was Luz . )
the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him , " Please show us the entrance into the city , and we will deal kindly with you . "
the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Zebulun didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their altars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
therefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare to you . "
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals ;
and they forsook Yahweh , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yahweh to anger .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
yet they didn 't listen to their judges ; for they played the prostitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obeying the commandments of Yahweh . they didn 't do so .
when Yahweh raised them up judges , then Yahweh was with the judge , and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them .
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing of it :
the five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years .
when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel , who saved them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
the Spirit of Yahweh came on him , and he judged Israel ; and he went out to war , and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand : and his hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
but when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised them up a savior , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a man left @-@ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
but he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , " I have a secret errand to you , king . " the king said , " Keep silence ! " all who stood by him went out from him .
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he didn 't draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
he said to them , " Follow me ; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . " they followed him , and took the Fords of the Jordan against the Moabites , and didn 't allow any man to pass over .
they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , when Ehud was dead .
now Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lappidoth , she judged Israel at that time .
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
I will draw to you , to the river Kishon , Sisera , the captain of Jabin 's army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into your hand . ' "
Barak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
Deborah said to Barak , " Go ; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand . hasn 't Yahweh gone out before you ? " so Barak went down from Mount Tabor , and ten thousand men after him .
Yahweh confused Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his army , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera alighted from his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don 't be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Please give me a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . " she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inquires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
" Yahweh , when you went forth out of Seir , when you marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Machir . those who handle the marshal 's staff came out of Zebulun .
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
" the kings came and fought , then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo . they took no plunder of silver .
" Jael shall be blessed above women , the wife of Heber the Kenite ; blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , until you come to Gaza , and left no sustenance in Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor donkey .
and I said to you , " I am Yahweh your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
Yahweh looked at him , and said , " Go in this your might , and save Israel from the hand of Midian . haven 't I sent you ? "
he said to him , " O Lord , how shall I save Israel ? behold , my family is the poorest in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father 's house . "
he said to him , " If now I have found favor in your sight , then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me .
please don 't go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
the angel of God said to him , " Take the meat and the unleavened cakes , and lay them on this rock , and pour out the broth . " he did so .
then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh , and called it " Yahweh is Peace . " to this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
it happened the same night , that Yahweh said to him , " Take your father 's bull , even the second bull seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has , and cut down the Asherah that is by it ;
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and encamped in the valley of Jezreel .
he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
behold , I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and encamped beside the spring of Harod : and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
Yahweh said to Gideon , " The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand , lest Israel vaunt themselves against me , saying , ' My own hand has saved me . '
now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , ' Whoever is fearful and trembling , let him return and depart from Mount Gilead . ' " twenty @-@ two thousand of the people returned , and ten thousand remained .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yahweh said to Gideon , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink . "
Yahweh said to Gideon , " By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into your hand . let all the other people go , each to his own place . "
so the people took food in their hand , and their trumpets ; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men : and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
it happened the same night , that Yahweh said to him , " Arise , go down into the camp ; for I have delivered it into your hand .
and you shall hear what they say ; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
his fellow answered , " This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel . God has delivered Midian into his hand , with all the army . "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets , and empty pitchers , with torches within the pitchers .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the outermost part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
the three companies blew the trumpets , and broke the pitchers , and held the torches in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow ; and they shouted , " The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon ! "
they blew the three hundred trumpets , and Yahweh set every man 's sword against his fellow , and against all the army ; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah , as far as the border of Abel Meholah , by Tabbath .
the men of Ephraim said to him , " Why have you treated us this way , that you didn 't call us , when you went to fight with Midian ? " they rebuked him sharply .
he said to them , " What have I now done in comparison with you ? isn 't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer ?
God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb ! what was I able to do in comparison with you ? " then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
he said to the men of Succoth , " Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me ; for they are faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian . "
the princes of Succoth said , " Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your army ? "
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
he came to the men of Succoth , and said , " See Zebah and Zalmunna , concerning whom you taunted me , saying , ' Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are weary ? ' "
then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna , " What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor ? " they answered , " They were like you . each one resembled the children of a king . "
he said to Jether his firstborn , " Get up , and kill them ! " but the youth didn 't draw his sword ; for he was afraid , because he was yet a youth .
then Zebah and Zalmunna said , " Rise and fall on us ; for as the man is , so is his strength . " Gideon arose , and killed Zebah and Zalmunna , and took the crescents that were on their camels ' necks .
Gideon said to them , " I would make a request of you , that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil . " ( for they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites . )
Gideon made an ephod of it , and put it in his city , even in Ophrah : and all Israel played the prostitute after it there ; and it became a snare to Gideon , and to his house .
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , Gideon , according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel .
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
he went to his father 's house at Ophrah , and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal , being seventy persons , on one stone : but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " Listen to me , you men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
" the bramble said to the trees , ' If in truth you anoint me king over you , then come and take refuge in my shade ; and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon . '
" now therefore , if you have dealt truly and righteously , in that you have made Abimelech king , and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands
( for my father fought for you , and risked his life , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ;
but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech . "
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
Abimelech rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
then Zebul said to him , " Now where is your mouth , that you said , ' Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? ' isn 't this the people that you have despised ? please go out now and fight with them . "
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it , they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith .
all the people likewise each cut down his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them at the base of the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer , and said to him , " Draw your sword , and kill me , that men not say of me , ' A woman killed him . ' his young man thrust him through , and he died . "
and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads : and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim .
they troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year . for eighteen years , they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was very distressed .
the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , saying , " We have sinned against you , even because we have forsaken our God , and have served the Baals . "
the Sidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , oppressed you ; and you cried to me , and I saved you out of their hand .
the children of Israel said to Yahweh , " We have sinned : do you to us whatever seems good to you ; only deliver us , please , this day . "
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Yahweh ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpah .
Gilead 's wife bore him sons ; and when his wife 's sons grew up , they drove out Jephthah , and said to him , " You shall not inherit in our father 's house ; for you are the son of another woman . "
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
and they said to Jephthah , " Come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of Ammon . "
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , " didn 't you hate me , and drive me out of my father 's house ? why have you come to me now when you are in distress ? "
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , " If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon , and Yahweh deliver them before me , shall I be your head ? "
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Yahweh shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea , and came to Kadesh ;
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said to him , ' Please let us pass through your land to my place . '
Yahweh , the God of Israel , delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they struck them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
so now Yahweh , the God of Israel , has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel , and should you possess them ?
now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ?
I therefore have not sinned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yahweh , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon . "
however the king of the children of Ammon didn 't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand ,
he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith , even twenty cities , and to Abelcheramim , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
Jephthah said to them , " I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , you didn 't save me out of their hand .
when I saw that you didn 't save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Yahweh delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
the Gileadites took the Fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites . it was so , that when the fugitives of Ephraim said , " Let me go over , " the men of Gilead said to him , " Are you an Ephraimite ? " if he said , " No " ;
Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the hill country of the Amalekites .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and didn 't bear .
but he said to me , ' Behold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death . ' "
then Manoah entreated Yahweh , and said , " Oh , Lord , please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
God listened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah , her husband , wasn 't with her .
Manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said to him , " Are you the man who spoke to the woman ? " he said , " I am . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah , " Though you detain me , I won 't eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Yahweh . " for Manoah didn 't know that he was the angel of Yahweh .
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " What is your name , that when your words happen , we may honor you ? "
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
but the angel of Yahweh didn 't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more . then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh .
but his wife said to him , " If Yahweh were pleased to kill us , he wouldn 't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand , neither would he have shown us all these things , nor would at this time have told such things as these . "
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion : and behold , there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
he took it into his hands , and went on , eating as he went ; and he came to his father and mother , and gave to them , and they ate : but he didn 't tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion .
his father went down to the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
Samson said to them , " Let me tell you a riddle now . if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing ;
he said to them , " Out of the eater came forth food . out of the strong came forth sweetness . " they couldn 't in three days declare the riddle .
her father said , " I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to your companion . isn 't her younger sister more beautiful than she ? please take her , instead . "
Samson said to them , " This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines , when I harm them . "
Samson said to them , " If you behave like this , surely I will be avenged of you , and after that I will cease . "
the men of Judah said , " Why have you come up against us ? " they said , " We have come up to bind Samson , to do to him as he has done to us . "
they spoke to him , saying , " No ; but we will bind you fast , and deliver you into their hand ; but surely we will not kill you . " they bound him with two new ropes , and brought him up from the rock .
when he came to Lehi , the Philistines shouted as they met him : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him , and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire , and his bands dropped from off his hands .
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
he was very thirsty , and called on Yahweh , and said , " You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? "
it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
Samson said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
Delilah said to Samson , " Behold , you have mocked me , and told me lies : now please tell me with which you might be bound . "
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
she fastened it with the pin , and said to him , " The Philistines are on you , Samson ! " he awakened out of his sleep , and plucked away the pin of the beam , and the web .
she made him sleep on her knees ; and she called for a man , and shaved off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
she said , " The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! " he awoke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he didn 't know that Yahweh had departed from him .
the Philistines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hearts were merry , that they said , " Call for Samson , that he may entertain us . " they called for Samson out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women , who saw while Samson performed .
Samson called to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , remember me , please , and strengthen me , please , only this once , God , that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes . "
then his brothers and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father . he judged Israel twenty years .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engraved image and a molten image : and it was in the house of Micah .
Micah said to him , " Dwell with me , and be to me a father and a priest , and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year , a suit of clothing , and your food . " so the Levite went in .
then Micah said , " Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me , since I have a Levite to my priest . "
he said to them , " Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me , and he has hired me , and I am become his priest . "
when you go , you shall come to a secure people , and the land is large ; for God has given it into your hand , a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth . "
then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered , and said to their brothers , " Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod , and teraphim , and an engraved image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what you have to do . "
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them .
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan said to him , " Don 't let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
they took that which Micah had made , and the priest whom he had , and came to Laish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the sword ; and they burnt the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
his concubine played the prostitute against him , and went away from him to her father 's house to Bethlehem Judah , and was there the space of four months .
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your handmaid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
behold , here is my virgin daughter and his concubine . I will bring them out now . humble them , and do with them what seems good to you ; but to this man don 't do any such folly . "
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the donkey ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
it was so , that all who saw it said , " There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day ! consider it , take counsel , and speak . "
then all the children of Israel went out , and the congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , to Yahweh at Mizpah .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , " What wickedness is this that is happen among you ?
the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty @-@ six thousand men who drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , who were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
the children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening ; and they asked of Yahweh , saying , " Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? " Yahweh said , " Go up against him . "
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
the children of Israel asked of Yahweh ( for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
and Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , stood before it in those days ) , saying , " Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother , or shall I cease ? " Yahweh said , " Go up ; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand . "
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar : and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place , even out of Maareh Geba .
Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty @-@ five thousand one hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon : and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men , and followed hard after them to Gidom , and struck of them two thousand men .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , why has this happened in Israel , that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel ? "
it happened on the next day that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
how shall we provide wives for those who remain , since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ? "
the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant , and commanded them , saying , " Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the little ones .
this is the thing that you shall do : you shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman who has lain with a man . "
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon , and proclaimed peace to them .
the people grieved for Benjamin , because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
they said , " There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
they said , " Behold , there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh , which is on the north of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah . "
they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , " Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
it happened in the days when the judges judged , that there was a famine in the land . a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
the name of the man was Elimelech , and the name of his wife Naomi , and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah . they came into the country of Moab , and continued there .
they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they lived there about ten years .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
Naomi said to her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law , " Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Yahweh deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother @-@ in @-@ law , but Ruth joined with her .
she said , " Behold , your sister @-@ in @-@ law has gone back to her people , and to her god . follow your sister @-@ in @-@ law . "
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Naomi ? "
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech , and his name was Boaz .
Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , " Let me now go to the field , and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor . " she said to her , " Go , my daughter . "
she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , " Yahweh be with you . " they answered him , " Yahweh bless you . "
then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers , " Whose young lady is this ? "
she said , ' Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves . ' so she came , and has continued even from the morning until now , except that she stayed a little in the house . "
then Boaz said to Ruth , " Listen , my daughter . Don 't go to glean in another field , and don 't go from here , but stay here close to my maidens .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comforted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid , though I am not as one of your handmaidens . "
also pull out some for her from the bundles , and leave it , and let her glean , and don 't rebuke her . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @-@ in @-@ law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed .
Naomi said to Ruth her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , " It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his maidens , and that they not meet you in any other field . "
so she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz , to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Naomi her mother @-@ in @-@ law said to her , " My daughter , shall I not seek rest for you , that it may be well with you ?
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
it shall be , when he lies down , that you shall mark the place where he shall lie , and you shall go in , and uncover his feet , and lay down ; then he will tell you what you shall do . "
when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain . she came softly , uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
it happened at midnight , that the man was startled and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
he said , " Who are you ? " she answered , " I am Ruth your handmaid . therefore spread your skirt over your handmaid ; for you are a near kinsman . "
now , my daughter , don 't be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
he said , " Bring the mantle that is on you , and hold it . " she held it ; and he measured six measures of barley , and laid it on her ; and he went into the city .
when she came to her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she said , " How did it go , my daughter ? " she told her all that the man had done to her .
she said , " He gave me these six measures of barley ; for he said , ' Don 't go empty to your mother @-@ in @-@ law . ' "
then she said , " Sit still , my daughter , until you know how the matter will fall ; for the man will not rest , until he has finished the thing this day . "
now Boaz went up to the gate , and sat down there . behold , the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by ; to whom he said , " Come over here , friend , and sit down ! " he turned aside , and sat down .
he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , " Sit down here . " they sat down .
then Boaz said , " On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi , you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance . "
the near kinsman said , " I can 't redeem it for myself , lest I mar my own inheritance . take my right of redemption for yourself ; for I can 't redeem it . "
now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man took off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was the way of attestation in Israel .
so the near kinsman said to Boaz , " Buy it for yourself . " he took off his shoe .
the women said to Naomi , " Blessed be Yahweh , who has not left you this day without a near kinsman ; and let his name be famous in Israel .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Naomi " ; and they named him Obed . he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim , of the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh . the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , priests to Yahweh , were there .
but to Hannah he gave a double portion ; for he loved Hannah , but Yahweh had shut up her womb .
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yahweh , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and didn 't eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh 's temple .
Don 't count your handmaid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
it happened , when the time had come , that Hannah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Yahweh . "
the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
but Hannah didn 't go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yahweh , and stay there forever . "
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh . as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh . " he worshiped Yahweh there .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don 't let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Yahweh is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a fork of three teeth in his hand ;
yes , before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man who sacrificed , " Give meat to roast for the priest ; for he will not accept boiled meat from you , but raw . "
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting .
a man of God came to Eli , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
the man of yours , whom I shall not cut off from my altar , shall consume your eyes , and grieve your heart ; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
therefore Eli said to Samuel , " Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Speak , Yahweh ; for your servant hears . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he didn 't restrain them .
therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Eli 's house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever . "
then Eli called Samuel , and said , " Samuel , my son ! " he said , " Here I am . "
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the people had come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , " Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines ? let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us , that it may come among us , and save us out of the hand of our enemies . "
when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
woe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
be strong , and behave like men , O you Philistines , that you not be servants to the Hebrews , as they have been to you . strengthen yourselves like men , and fight ! "
when he came , behold , Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching ; for his heart trembled for the ark of God . when the man came into the city , and told it , all the city cried out .
the man said to Eli , " I am he who came out of the army , and I fled today out of the army . " he said , " How did the matter go , my son ? "
he who brought the news answered , " Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people . your two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God has been captured . "
she named the child Ichabod , saying , " The glory has departed from Israel " ; because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father @-@ in @-@ law and her husband .
when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day , behold , Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh . they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any who come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod , to this day .
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , " What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
then they said , " What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him ? " they said , " Five golden tumors , and five golden mice , for the number of the lords of the Philistines ; for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no yoke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
and take the ark of Yahweh , and lay it on the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which you return him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by its side ; and send it away , that it may go .
the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh , and the coffer that was with it , in which the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh .
he struck of the men of Beth Shemesh , because they had looked into the ark of Yahweh , he struck of the people fifty thousand seventy men ; and the people mourned , because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter .
the men of Beth Shemesh said , " Who is able to stand before Yahweh , this holy God ? to whom shall he go up from us ? "
it happened , from the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh .
they gathered together to Mizpah , and drew water , and poured it out before Yahweh , and fasted on that day , and said there , " We have sinned against Yahweh . " Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah .
when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and struck them , until they came under Beth Kar .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abijah : they were judges in Beersheba .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and they shall run before his chariots ;
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
you shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you ; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day . "
but the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel ; and they said , " No ; but we will have a king over us ,
that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles . "
Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
the donkeys of Kish , Saul 's father , were lost . Kish said to Saul his son , " Take now one of the servants with you , and arise , go seek the donkeys . "
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
then Saul said to his servant , " But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God . what do we have ? "
then Saul said to his servant , " Well said . come , let us go . " so they went to the city where the man of God was .
as they went up the ascent to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said to them , " Is the seer here ? "
they answered them , and said , " He is . behold , he is before you . hurry now , for he has come today into the city ; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place .
when Samuel saw Saul , Yahweh said to him , " Behold , the man of whom I spoke to you ! this same shall have authority over my people . "
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , " Please tell me where the seer 's house is . "
Samuel answered Saul , and said , " I am the seer . go up before me to the high place , for you shall eat with me today . in the morning I will let you go , and will tell you all that is in your heart .
as for your donkeys who were lost three days ago , don 't set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the guest room , and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited , who were about thirty persons .
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took the vial of oil , and poured it on his head , and kissed him , and said , " isn 't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance ?
and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you , and you shall prophesy with them , and shall be turned into another man .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
" you shall go down before me to Gilgal ; and behold , I will come down to you , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : you shall wait seven days , until I come to you , and show you what you shall do . "
when they came there to the hill , behold , a band of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him , and he prophesied among them .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , " Where did you go ? " he said , " To seek the donkeys . when we saw that they were not found , we came to Samuel . "
Saul said to his uncle , " He told us plainly that the donkeys were found . " but concerning the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel spoke , he didn 't tell him .
he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families ; and the family of the Matrites was taken ; and Saul the son of Kish was taken : but when they sought him , he could not be found .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
Samuel said to all the people , " You see him whom Yahweh has chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? " all the people shouted , and said , " Let the king live ! "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then Nahash the Ammonite came up , and encamped against Jabesh Gilead : and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash , " Make a covenant with us , and we will serve you . "
Nahash the Ammonite said to them , " On this condition I will make it with you , that all your right eyes be put out ; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel . "
the elders of Jabesh said to him , " Give us seven day , that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel ; and then , if there is no one to save us , we will come out to you . "
behold , Saul came following the oxen out of the field ; and Saul said , " What ails the people that they weep ? " they told him the words of the men of Jabesh .
he numbered them in Bezek ; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , " Tomorrow we will come out to you , and you shall do with us all that seems good to you . "
the people said to Samuel , " Who is he who said , ' Shall Saul reign over us ? ' bring those men , that we may put them to death ! "
Saul said , " There shall not a man be put to death this day ; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel . "
all the people went to Gilgal ; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal ; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly .
now , behold , the king walks before you ; and I am old and gray @-@ headed ; and behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my youth to this day .
he said to them , " Yahweh is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that you have not found anything in my hand . " they said , " He is witness . "
Samuel said to the people , " It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh , which he did to you and to your fathers .
" but they forgot Yahweh their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab ; and they fought against them .
they cried to Yahweh , and said , ' We have sinned , because we have forsaken Yahweh , and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve you . '
" when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yahweh your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Yahweh has set a king over you .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
isn 't it wheat harvest today ? I will call to Yahweh , that he may send thunder and rain ; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great , which you have done in the sight of Yahweh , in asking for a king . "
all the people said to Samuel , " Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God , that we not die ; for we have added to all our sins this evil , to ask us a king . "
Samuel said to the people , " Don 't be afraid . you have indeed done all this evil ; yet don 't turn aside from following Yahweh , but serve Yahweh with all your heart .
for Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba : and the Philistines heard of it . Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , " Let the Hebrews hear ! "
all Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines , and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines . the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal .
the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude : and they came up , and encamped in Michmash , eastward of Beth Aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
Samuel said , " What have you done ? " Saul said , " Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that you didn 't come within the days appointed , and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash ;
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
Samuel said to Saul , " You have done foolishly . you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God , which he commanded you ; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever .
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel ; for the Philistines said , " Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears " ;
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people who were with him were about six hundred men ;
and Ahijah , the son of Ahitub , Ichabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . the people didn 't know that Jonathan was gone .
his armor bearer said to him , " Do all that is in your heart . turn and , behold , I am with you according to your heart . "
but if they say this , ' Come up to us ! ' then we will go up ; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand . this shall be the sign to us . "
both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , " Behold , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled ; and the earth quaked : so there was an exceeding great trembling .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
it happened , while Saul talked to the priest , that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said to the priest , " Withdraw your hand ! "
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
the men of Israel were distressed that day ; for Saul had adjured the people , saying , " Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening , and I am avenged of my enemies . " so none of the people tasted food .
but Jonathan didn 't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then one of the people answered , and said , " Your father directly commanded the people with an oath , saying , ' Cursed is the man who eats food this day . ' " the people were faint .
then Jonathan said , " My father has troubled the land . please look how my eyes have been enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey .
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
Saul asked counsel of God , " Shall I go down after the Philistines ? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel ? " but he didn 't answer him that day .
Saul said , " Draw near here , all you chiefs of the people ; and know and see in which this sin has been this day .
then he said to all Israel , " You be on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . " the people said to Saul , " Do what seems good to you . "
he did valiantly , and struck the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
Samuel said to Saul , " Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people , over Israel . now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , ' I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Samuel came to Saul ; and Saul said to him , " You are blessed by Yahweh ! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh . "
Samuel said , " Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears , and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean ? "
Saul said , " They have brought them from the Amalekites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Yahweh your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
then Samuel said to Saul , " Stay , and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night . " he said to him , " Say on . "
Samuel said , " Though you were little in your own sight , weren 't you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel ;
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh , and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
Saul said to Samuel , " I have sinned ; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh , and your words , because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
then he said , " I have sinned : yet please honor me now before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and come back with me , that I may worship Yahweh your God . "
then Samuel said , " Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites ! " Agag came to him cheerfully . Agag said , " Surely the bitterness of death is past . "
Samuel said , " How can I go ? if Saul hears it , he will kill me . " Yahweh said , " Take a heifer with you , and say , I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh .
he said , " peaceably ; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh . sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . " he sanctified Jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
it happened , when they had come , that he looked at Eliab , and said , " Surely Yahweh 's anointed is before him . "
but Yahweh said to Samuel , " Don 't look on his face , or on the height of his stature ; because I have rejected him : for I see not as man sees ; for man looks at the outward appearance , but Yahweh looks at the heart . "
then Jesse made Shammah to pass by . he said , " Neither has Yahweh chosen this one . "
he sent , and brought him in . now he was ruddy , and withal of a beautiful face , and goodly to look on . Yahweh said , " Arise , anoint him ; for this is he . "
then Samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
let our lord now command your servants who are before you , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp . it shall happen , when the evil spirit from God is on you , that he shall play with his hand , and you shall be well . "
it happened , when the spirit from God was on Saul , that David took the harp , and played with his hand : so Saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle ; and they were gathered together at Socoh , which belongs to Judah , and encamped between Socoh and Azekah , in Ephesdammim .
the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and his shield bearer went before him .
if he be able to fight with me , and kill me , then will we be your servants ; but if I prevail against him , and kill him , then you will be our servants , and serve us . "
the Philistine said , " I defy the armies of Israel this day ! give me a man , that we may fight together ! "
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
Jesse said to David his son , " Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain , and these ten loaves , and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers ;
David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the place of the wagons , as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
David spoke to the men who stood by him , saying , " What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine , and takes away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ? "
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
David said to Saul , " Your servant was keeping his father 's sheep ; and when a lion or a bear came , and took a lamb out of the flock ,
I went out after him , and struck him , and rescued it out of his mouth . when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard , and struck him , and killed him .
David said , " Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Yahweh shall be with you . "
when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and withal of a fair face .
and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn 't save with sword and spear : for the battle is Yahweh 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and killed him , and cut off his head therewith . when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine , he said to Abner , the captain of the army , " Abner , whose son is this youth ? " Abner said , " As your soul lives , O king , I can 't tell . "
Saul said to him , " Whose son are you , you young man ? " David answered , " I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite . "
David went out wherever Saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely : and Saul set him over the men of war , and it was good in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of Saul 's servants .
Saul was very angry , and this saying displeased him ; and he said , " They have ascribed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands . what can he have more but the kingdom ? "
and Saul threw the spear ; for he said , " I will pin David even to the wall ! " David escaped from his presence twice .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
but it happened at the time when Merab , Saul 's daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife .
Saul said , " You shall tell David , ' The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king 's enemies . ' " now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father , and said to him , " Don 't let the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he has not sinned against you , and because his works have been very good toward you ;
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Michal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don 't save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
when the messengers came in , behold , the teraphim was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
Saul said to Michal , " Why have you deceived me thus , and let my enemy go , so that he is escaped ? " Michal answered Saul , " He said to me , ' Let me go ! why should I kill you ? ' "
then went he also to Ramah , and came to the great well that is in Secu : and he asked , " Where are Samuel and David ? " one said , " Behold , they are at Naioth in Ramah . "
he also stripped off his clothes , and he also prophesied before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . therefore they say , " Is Saul also among the prophets ? "
David fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said before Jonathan , " What have I done ? what is my iniquity ? what is my sin before your father , that he seeks my life ? "
then Jonathan said to David , " Whatever your soul desires , I will even do it for you . "
David said to Jonathan , " Behold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
Jonathan caused David to swear again , for the love that he had to him ; for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started , and shall remain by the stone Ezel .
but if I say this to the boy , ' Behold , the arrows are beyond you ; ' then go your way ; for Yahweh has sent you away .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
nevertheless Saul didn 't say anything that day : for he thought , " Something has happened to him . he is not clean . surely he is not clean . "
it happened on the next day after the new moon , the second day , that David 's place was empty . Saul said to Jonathan his son , " Why doesn 't the son of Jesse come to eat , neither yesterday , nor today ? "
then Saul 's anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said to him , " You son of a perverse rebellious woman , don 't I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame , and to the shame of your mother 's nakedness ?
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " isn 't the arrow beyond you ? "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don 't delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kissed one another , and wept one with another , and David wept the most .
now therefore what is under your hand ? give me five loaves of bread in my hand , or whatever there is present . "
the priest answered David , and said , " There is no common bread under my hand , but there is holy bread ; if only the young men have kept themselves from women . "
so the priest gave him holy bread ; for there was no bread there but the show bread , that was taken from before Yahweh , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
the servants of Achish said to him , " isn 't this David the king of the land ? didn 't they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
he changed his behavior before them , and pretended to be mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down on his beard .
then Achish said to his servants , " Look , you see the man is mad . why then have you brought him to me ?
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Adullam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was discontented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
David went there to Mizpeh of Moab , and he said to the king of Moab , " Please let my father and my mother come out with you , until I know what God will do for me . "
the prophet Gad said to David , " Don 't stay in the stronghold . depart , and go into the land of Judah . " then David departed , and came into the forest of Hereth .
Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Saul was sitting in Gibeah , under the tamarisk tree in Ramah , with his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then Doeg the Edomite , who stood by the servants of Saul , answered and said , " I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
Saul said , " Hear now , you son of Ahitub . " he answered , " Here I am , my lord . "
then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , " Who among all your servants is so faithful as David , who is the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law , and is taken into your council , and is honorable in your house ?
the king said to Doeg , " Turn and attack the priests ! " Doeg the Edomite turned , and he attacked the priests , and he killed on that day eighty @-@ five people who wore a linen ephod .
he struck Nob , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and donkeys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
David said to Abiathar , " I knew on that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father 's house .
David was told , " Behold , the Philistines are fighting against Keilah , and are robbing the threshing floors . "
David 's men said to him , " Behold , we are afraid here in Judah : how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ? "
then David inquired of Yahweh yet again . Yahweh answered him , and said , " Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand . "
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . Saul said , " God has delivered him into my hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that has gates and bars . "
then David said , " O Yahweh , the God of Israel , your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as your servant has heard ? Yahweh , the God of Israel , I beg you , tell your servant . " Yahweh said , " He will come down . "
then David said , " Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? " Yahweh said , " They will deliver you up . "
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went wherever they could go . it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he gave up going there .
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . Saul sought him every day , but God didn 't deliver him into his hand .
he said to him , " Don 't be afraid ; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you ; and you shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you ; and that also Saul my father knows . "
then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " doesn 't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the desert ?
they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah on the south of the desert .
but a messenger came to Saul , saying , " Hurry and come ; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land ! "
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " Behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
David swore to Saul . Saul went home ; but David and his men went up to the stronghold .
there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my shearers , and give it to men who I don 't know where they come from ? "
now therefore know and consider what you will do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his house ; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can 't speak to him . "
then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread , two bottles of wine , five sheep ready dressed , five measures of parched grain , one hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on donkeys .
she said to her young men , " Go on before me . behold , I come after you . " but she didn 't tell her husband , Nabal .
it was so , as she rode on her donkey , and came down by the covert of the mountain , that behold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
now David had said , " Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him . he has returned me evil for good .
when Abigail saw David , she hurried , and alighted from her donkey , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
she fell at his feet , and said , " On me , my lord , on me be the iniquity ; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears . hear the words of your handmaid .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
David said to Abigail , " Blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me !
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " Behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Abigail hurried , and arose , and rode on a donkey , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David arose , and came to the place where Saul had encamped ; and David saw the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul lay within the place of the wagons , and the people were encamped around him .
then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , brother to Joab , saying , " Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? " Abishai said , " I will go down with you . "
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons , with his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people lay around him .
David said to Abishai , " Don 't destroy him ; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh 's anointed , and be guiltless ? "
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of the mountain afar off ; a great space being between them ;
and David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , " Don 't you answer , Abner ? " then Abner answered , " Who are you who cries to the king ? "
David said to Abner , " aren 't you a man ? who is like you in Israel ? why then have you not kept watch over your lord , the king ? for one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord .
this thing isn 't good that you have done . as Yahweh lives , you are worthy to die , because you have not kept watch over your lord , Yahweh 's anointed . now see where the king 's spear is , and the jar of water that was at his head . "
Saul knew David 's voice , and said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " David said , " It is my voice , my lord , O king . "
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
then Saul said to David , " You are blessed , my son David . you shall both do mightily , and shall surely prevail . " so David went his way , and Saul returned to his place .
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
Achish said , " Against whom have you made a raid today ? " David said , " Against the South of Judah , against the South of the Jerahmeelites , and against the South of the Kenites . "
Achish believed David , saying , " He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him . therefore he shall be my servant forever . "
it happened in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Achish said to David , " Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
Saul swore to her by Yahweh , saying , " As Yahweh lives , no punishment shall happen to you for this thing . "
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , and didn 't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek , therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day .
moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines . "
then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth , and was terrified , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , constrained him ; and he listened to their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat on the bed .
the woman had a fattened calf in the house . she hurried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread of it .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
Achish answered David , " I know that you are good in my sight , as an angel of God . notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , ' He shall not go up with us to the battle . '
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they didn 't kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
so David went , he and the six hundred men who were with him , and came to the brook Besor , where those who were left behind stayed .
but David pursued , he and four hundred men ; for two hundred stayed behind , who were so faint that they couldn 't go over the brook Besor .
they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
David asked him , " To whom do you belong ? where are you from ? " he said , " I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an Amalekite ; and my master left me , because three days ago I fell sick .
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
then David said , " You shall not do so , my brothers , with that which Yahweh has given to us , who has preserved us , and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage : they shall share alike . "
when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , " Behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh . "
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley , and those who were beyond the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan ; and they came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
he said to me , ' Please stand beside me , and kill me ; for anguish has taken hold of me , because my life is yet whole in me . '
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
Don 't tell it in Gath . Don 't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon , lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swifter than eagles . they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
it happened after this , that David inquired of Yahweh , saying , " Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah ? " Yahweh said to him , " Go up . " David said , " Where shall I go up ? " he said , " To Hebron . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " Blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them . "
Abner said to Joab , " Please let the young men arise and play before us ! " Joab said , " Let them arise ! "
then they arose and went over by number : twelve for Benjamin , and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
the battle was very severe that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
then Abner looked behind him , and said , " Is it you , Asahel ? " he answered , " It is I. "
Abner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
but Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one band , and stood on the top of a hill .
Joab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
so Joab blew the trumpet ; and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and came to Mahanaim .
Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
they took up Asahel , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Joab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at Hebron .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and the sixth , Ithream , of Eglah , David 's wife . these were born to David in Hebron .
now Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah : and Ishbosheth said to Abner , " Why have you gone in to my father 's concubine ? "
Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , " Whose is the land ? " and saying , " Make your alliance with me , and behold , my hand shall be with you , to bring all Israel around to you . "
David sent messengers to Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , saying , " Deliver me my wife Michal , whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines . "
her husband went with her , weeping as he went , and followed her to Bahurim . then Abner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
behold , the servants of David and Joab came from a foray , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Abner was not with David in Hebron ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Joab and all the army who was with him had come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Joab came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? behold , Abner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
you know Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
afterward , when David heard it , he said , " I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
they buried Abner in Hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
the king said to his servants , " Don 't you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel ?
Saul 's son had two men who were captains of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin ( for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin :
the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , as he took his rest at noon .
they came there into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetched wheat ; and they struck him in the body : and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said to them , " As Yahweh lives , who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
David commanded his young men , and they killed them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron . but they took the head of Ishbosheth , and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron .
then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron , and spoke , saying , " Behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
in times past , when Saul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over Israel . ' "
when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stronghold .
David inquired of Yahweh , saying , " Shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to David , " Go up ; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand . "
David came to Baal Perazim , and David struck them there ; and he said , " Yahweh has broken my enemies before me , like the breach of waters . " therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim .
David arose , and went with all the people who were with him , from Baale Judah , to bring up from there the ark of God , which is called by the Name , even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits above the cherubim .
they set the ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon , Uzzah reached for the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stumbled .
David was afraid of Yahweh that day ; and he said , " How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me ? "
the ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite three months : and Yahweh blessed Obed @-@ Edom , and all his house .
it was so , as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
David said to Michal , " It was before Yahweh , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh .
I will be yet more vile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
it happened , when the king lived in his house , and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around ,
" go and tell my servant David , ' Thus says Yahweh , " Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in ?
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
I have been with you wherever you went , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men ;
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
for you , Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
he struck Moab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
of Syria , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , and of Amalek , and of the spoil of Hadadezer , son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , even eighteen thousand men .
David said , " Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul , that I may show him kindness for Jonathan 's sake ? "
there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba , and they called him to David ; and the king said to him , " Are you Ziba ? " he said , " Your servant is he . "
the king said , " Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may show the kindness of God to him ? " Ziba said to the king , " Jonathan has yet a son , who is lame of his feet . "
the king said to him , " Where is he ? " Ziba said to the king , " Behold , he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , in Lo debar . "
Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , came to David , and fell on his face , and showed respect . David said , " Mephibosheth . " he answered , " Behold , your servant ! "
David said to him , " Don 't be afraid of him ; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father 's sake , and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father . you shall eat bread at my table continually . "
he bowed down , and said , " What is your servant , that you should look on such a dead dog as I am ? "
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
then Ziba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so Mephibosheth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
David said , " I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash , as his father showed kindness to me . " so David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father . David 's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob , and the Syrians of Zobah , twenty thousand footmen , and the king of Maacah with one thousand men , and the men of Tob twelve thousand men .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
Hadadezer sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Helam , with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers , and forty thousand horsemen , and struck Shobach the captain of their army , so that he died there .
when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
David sent and inquired after the woman . one said , " isn 't this Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ? "
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her uncleanness ) ; and she returned to her house .
the woman conceived ; and she sent and told David , and said , " I am with child . "
David said to Uriah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and didn 't go down to his house .
when they had told David , saying , " Uriah didn 't go down to his house , " David said to Uriah , " Haven 't you come from a journey ? why didn 't you go down to your house ? "
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him drunk . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but didn 't go down to his house .
the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab . some of the people fell , even of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for .
the messenger said to David , " The men prevailed against us , and came out to us into the field , and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate .
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . "
then David said to the messenger , " Thus you shall tell Joab , ' Don 't let this thing displease you , for the sword devours one as well as another . make your battle stronger against the city , and overthrow it . ' encourage him . "
Nathan said to David , " You are the man . this is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says : ' I anointed you king over Israel , and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul .
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bosom , and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
" this is what Yahweh says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
but when David saw that his servants were whispering together , David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , " Is the child dead ? " they said , " He is dead . "
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and anointed himself , and changed his clothing ; and he came into the house of Yahweh , and worshiped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he ate .
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
he said , " While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept ; for I said , ' Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me , that the child may live ? '
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it ; lest I take the city , and it be called after my name . "
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
he said to him , " Why , son of the king , are you so sad from day to day ? won 't you tell me ? " Amnon said to him , " I love Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister . "
she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Amnon said , " Have all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
she answered him , " No , my brother , do not force me ! for no such thing ought to be done in Israel . Don 't you do this folly .
I , where would I carry my shame ? and as for you , you will be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , please speak to the king ; for he will not withhold me from you . "
then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . Amnon said to her , " Arise , be gone ! "
she said to him , " Not so , because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me ! " but he would not listen to her .
then he called his servant who ministered to him , and said , " Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
Tamar put ashes on her head , and tore her garment of various colors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , crying aloud as she went .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don 't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead . "
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and wept . the king also and all his servants wept bitterly .
King David longed to go forth to Absalom : for he was comforted concerning Amnon , since he was dead .
when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , showed respect , and said , " Help , O king ! "
the king said to her , " What ails you ? " she answered , " Truly I am a widow , and my husband is dead .
your handmaid had two sons , and they both fought together in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other , and killed him .
the woman of Tekoa said to the king , " My lord , O king , the iniquity be on me , and on my father 's house ; and the king and his throne be guiltless . "
then she said , " Please let the king remember Yahweh your God , that the Avenger of blood destroy not any more , lest they destroy my son . " he said , " As Yahweh lives , not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth . "
for we must die , and are as water split on the ground , which can 't be gathered up again ; neither does God take away life , but devises means , that he who is banished not be an outcast from him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then your handmaid said , ' Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . may Yahweh , your God , be with you . ' "
then the king answered the woman , " Please don 't hide anything from me that I ask you . " the woman said , " Let my lord the king now speak . "
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
the king said to Joab , " Behold now , I have done this thing . go therefore , bring the young man Absalom back . "
Joab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Joab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
the king said , " Let him return to his own house , but let him not see my face . " so Absalom returned to his own house , and didn 't see the king 's face .
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
then Joab arose , and came to Absalom to his house , and said to him , " Why have your servants set my field on fire ? "
so Joab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to Yahweh , in Hebron .
for your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria , saying , ' If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem , then I will serve Yahweh . ' "
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
a messenger came to David , saying , " The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom . "
the king 's servants said to the king , " Behold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses . "
then the king said to Ittai the Gittite , " Why do you also go with us ? return , and stay with the king ; for you are a foreigner , and also an exile . return to your own place .
whereas you came but yesterday , should I this day make you go up and down with us , since I go where I may ? return , and take back your brothers . mercy and truth be with you . "
Ittai answered the king , and said , " As Yahweh lives , and as my lord the king lives , surely in what place my lord the king shall is , whether for death or for life , even there also will your servant be . "
all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Zadok also came , and all the Levites with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God ; and they set down the ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
the king said to Zadok , " Carry back the ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his habitation ;
someone told David , saying , " Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . " David said , " Yahweh , please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness . "
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
when David was a little past the top , behold , Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him , with a couple of donkeys saddled , and on them two hundred loaves of bread , and one hundred clusters of raisins , and one hundred summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
the king said , " Where is your master 's son ? " Ziba said to the king , " Behold , he is staying in Jerusalem ; for he said , ' Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father . ' "
then the king said to Ziba , " Behold , all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours . " Ziba said , " I do obeisance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
Shimei said when he cursed , " Be gone , be gone , you man of blood , and base fellow !
Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have reigned ! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son ! behold , you are caught by your own mischief , because you are a man of blood ! "
then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , " Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? please let me go over and take off his head . "
the king said , " What have I to do with you , you sons of Zeruiah ? because he curses , and because Yahweh has said to him , ' Curse David ; ' who then shall say , ' Why have you done so ? ' "
Absalom , and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
it happened , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , had come to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
Hushai said to Absalom , " No ; but whomever Yahweh , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
Ahithophel said to Absalom , " Go in to your father 's concubines , that he has left to keep the house . then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father . then the hands of all who are with you will be strong . "
and I will bring back all the people to you . the man whom you seek is as if all returned . all the people shall be in peace . "
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
but I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that you go to battle in your own person .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , " Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way ; and I have counseled this way .
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , ' Don 't lodge this night at the Fords of the wilderness , but by all means pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people who are with him . ' "
now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel ; and a female servant used to go and tell them ; and they went and told king David . for they might not be seen to come into the city .
but a boy saw them , and told Absalom . then they both went away quickly , and came to the house of a man in Bahurim , who had a well in his court ; and they went down there .
Absalom 's servants came to the woman to the house ; and they said , " Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? " the woman said to them , " They have gone over the brook of water . " when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
it happened , after they had departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David ; and they said to David , " Arise and pass quickly over the water ; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you . "
then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
it happened , when David had come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim ,
honey , butter , sheep , and cheese of the herd , for David , and for the people who were with him , to eat : for they said , " The people are hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness . "
the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom .
a certain man saw it , and told Joab , and said , " Behold , I saw Absalom hanging in an oak . "
Joab said to the man who told him , " Behold , you saw it , and why didn 't you strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver , and a sash . "
otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
then Joab said to the Cushite , " Go , tell the king what you have seen ! " the Cushite bowed himself to Joab , and ran .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain , and outran the Cushite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watchman saw another man running ; and the watchman called to the porter , and said , " Behold , a man running alone ! " the king said , " He also brings news . "
the watchman said , " I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . " the king said , " He is a good man , and comes with good news . "
the king said , " Is it well with the young man Absalom ? " Ahimaaz answered , " When Joab sent the king 's servant , even me your servant , I saw a great tumult , but I don 't know what it was . "
the king said , " Turn aside , and stand here . " he turned aside , and stood still .
the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , " My son Absalom , Absalom , my son , my son ! "
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . they told to all the people , saying , " Behold , the king is sitting in the gate . " all the people came before the king . now Israel had fled every man to his tent .
Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why don 't you speak a word of bringing the king back ? "
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
a ferry boat went to bring over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king , when he had come over the Jordan .
for your servant knows that I have sinned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
he answered , " My lord , O king , my servant deceived me . for your servant said , I will saddle me a donkey , that I may ride thereon , and go with the king ; because your servant is lame .
he has slandered your servant to my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God . do therefore what is good in your eyes .
Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim ; and he went over the Jordan with the king , to conduct him over the Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
the king said to Barzillai , " Come over with me , and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gilgal , and Chimham went over with him . all the people of Judah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said to the king , " Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away , and brought the king , and his household , over the Jordan , and all David 's men with him ? "
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
then the king said to Amasa , " Call me the men of Judah together within three days , and be here present . "
David said to Abishai , " Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did . take your lord 's servants , and pursue after him , lest he get himself fortified cities , and escape out of our sight . "
there stood by him one of Joab 's young men , and said , " He who favors Joab , and he who is for David , let him follow Joab ! "
he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth Maacah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah , and they cast up a mound against the city , and it stood against the rampart ; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall , to throw it down .
then a wise woman cried out of the city , " Hear , hear ! please say to Joab , ' Come near here , that I may speak with you . ' "
I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel . you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel . why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh ? "
and David said to the Gibeonites , " What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make atonement , that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh ? "
they said to the king , " The man who consumed us , and who devised against us , that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel ,
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us , and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul , the chosen of Yahweh . " the king said , " I will give them . "
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead , who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan , where the Philistines had hanged them , in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa ;
and Ishbibenob , who was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight , he being armed with a new sword , thought to have slain David .
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him , and struck the Philistine , and killed him . then the men of David swore to him , saying , " You shall go no more out with us to battle , that you don 't quench the lamp of Israel . "
there was again war with the Philistines at GOB ; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite 's brother , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
these four were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my savior , you save me from violence .
he rode on a cherub , and flew . yes , he was seen on the wings of the wind .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me , for they were too mighty for me .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righteously , who rules in the fear of God ,
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite , against eight hundred slain at one time .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh worked a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David longed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh .
he said , " Be it far from me , Yahweh , that I should do this ! isn 't it the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives ? " therefore he would not drink it . the three mighty men did these things .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spear .
again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he moved David against them , saying , " Go , number Israel and Judah . "
they passed over the Jordan , and encamped in Aroer , on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad , and to Jazer :
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
" go and speak to David , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
Gad came that day to David , and said to him , " Go up , build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite . "
Araunah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Araunah said , " Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? " David said , " To buy your threshing floor , to build an altar to Yahweh , that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people . "
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . so Yahweh was entreated for the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
so they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel , and found Abishag the Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
the young lady was very beautiful ; and she cherished the king , and ministered to him ; but the king didn 't know her intimately .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Absalom .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth , which is beside En Rogel ; and he called all his brothers , the king 's sons , and all the men of Judah , the king 's servants :
Bathsheba went in to the king into the room . the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king .
Bathsheba bowed , and showed respect to the king . the king said , " What would you like ? "
she said to him , " My lord , you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne . '
he has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the army ; but he hasn 't called Solomon your servant .
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders . "
for he is gone down this day , and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the king 's sons , and the captains of the army , and Abiathar the priest . behold , they are eating and drinking before him , and say , ' Long live king Adonijah ! '
the king swore , and said , " As Yahweh lives , who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and showed respect to the king , and said , " Let my lord king David live forever ! "
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah . "
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king , and said , " Amen . may Yahweh , the God of my lord the king , say so .
as Yahweh has been with my lord the king , even so may he be with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David . "
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent , and anointed Solomon . they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , " Long live king Solomon ! "
all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
while he yet spoke , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said , " Come in ; for you are a worthy man , and bring good news . "
the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mule .
Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon . they have come up from there rejoicing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that you have heard .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
it was told Solomon , saying , " Behold , Adonijah fears king Solomon ; for , behold , he has laid hold on the horns of the altar , saying , ' Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword . ' "
Solomon said , " If he shows himself a worthy man , not a hair of him shall fall to the earth ; but if wickedness be found in him , he shall die . "
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . he came and bowed down to king Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , " Go to your house . "
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
do therefore according to your wisdom , and don 't let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace .
but show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those who eat at your table ; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother .
now therefore don 't hold him guiltless , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood . "
now I ask one petition of you . Don 't deny me . " she said to him , " Say on . "
he said , " Please speak to Solomon the king ( for he will not tell you ' no ' ) , that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife . "
Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon , to speak to him for Adonijah . the king rose up to meet her , and bowed himself to her , and sat down on his throne , and caused a throne to be set for the king 's mother ; and she sat on his right hand .
then she said , " I ask one small petition of you ; don 't deny me . " the king said to her , " Ask on , my mother ; for I will not deny you . "
now therefore as Yahweh lives , who has established me , and set me on the throne of David my father , and who has made me a house , as he promised , surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day . "
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh , that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh , which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
it was told king Solomon , " Joab has fled to the Tent of Yahweh , and behold , he is by the altar . " then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , " Go , fall on him . "
Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh , and said to him , " Thus says the king , ' Come forth ! ' " he said , " No ; but I will die here . " Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , " Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me . "
the king said to him , " Do as he has said , and fall on him , and bury him ; that you may take away the blood , which Joab shed without cause , from me and from my father 's house .
so shall their blood return on the head of Joab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Yahweh . "
the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army ; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar .
the king sent and called for Shimei , and said to him , " Build yourself a house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and don 't go out from there anywhere .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
Shimei said to the king , " The saying is good . as my lord the king has said , so will your servant do . " Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days .
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath . they told Shimei , saying , " Behold , your servants are in Gath . "
why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh , and the commandment that I have instructed you with ? "
the king said moreover to Shimei , " You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head .
only the people sacrificed in the high places , because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days .
in Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night ; and God said , " Ask what I shall give you . "
God said to him , " Because you have asked this thing , and have not asked for yourself long life , neither have asked riches for yourself , nor have asked the life of your enemies , but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice ;
behold , I have done according to your word . behold , I have given you a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there has been none like you before you , neither after you shall any arise like you .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
the other woman said , " No ; but the living is my son , and the dead is your son . " this said , " No ; but the dead is your son , and the living is my son . " thus they spoke before the king .
all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do justice .
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers ; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister , the king 's friend ;
Ben Geber , in Ramoth Gilead ( to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him belonged the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merry .
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and roebucks , and fattened fowl .
those officers provided food for king Solomon , and for all who came to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month ; they let nothing be lacking .
barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were , every man according to his duty .
there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , who had heard of his wisdom .
" you know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until Yahweh put them under the soles of his feet .
behold , I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God , as Yahweh spoke to David my father , saying , ' Your son , whom I will set on your throne in your place , he shall build the house for my name . '
Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , " I have heard the message which you have sent to me . I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
the king commanded , and they cut out great stones , costly stones , to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone .
Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders and the Gebalites cut them , and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar .
he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling : he built them for it within , for an oracle , even for the most holy place .
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh .
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in its height ; and he overlaid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
the whole house he overlaid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and two doors of fir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers ; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work .
in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
for he built the house of the forest of Lebanon ; its length was one hundred cubits , and its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits , on four rows of cedar pillars , with cedar beams on the pillars .
he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
all these were of costly stones , even of cut stone , according to measure , sawed with saws , inside and outside , even from the foundation to the coping , and so on the outside to the great court .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of cedar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh , and the porch of the house .
he made two capitals of molten brass , to set on the tops of the pillars : the height of the one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits .
there were nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
so he made the pillars ; and there were two rows around on the one network , to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars : and he did so for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the ledges ;
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubim ; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
every base had four bronze wheels , and axles of brass ; and the four feet of it had supports : beneath the basin were the supports molten , with wreaths at the side of each .
there were four supports at the four corners of each base : its supports were of the base itself .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Hiram made the basins , and the shovels , and the basins . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh :
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hiram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yahweh , were of burnished brass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh : the golden altar , and the table whereupon the show bread was , of gold ;
and the lampstands , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , of pure gold ; and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , of gold ;
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
they brought up the ark of Yahweh , and the Tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent ; even these the priests and the Levites brought up .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb , when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh .
he said , " Blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set a place for the ark , in which is the covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
and he said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven above , or on earth beneath ; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
listen to the supplication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sinned , and have done perversely ; we have dealt wickedly ; '
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant , and to the supplication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
for you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth , to be your inheritance , as you spoke by Moses your servant , when you brought our fathers out of Egypt , Lord Yahweh . "
" blessed be Yahweh , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Moses his servant .
that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh , he is God . there is none else .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to Yahweh , two and twenty thousand head of cattle , and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh .
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yahweh and the king 's house
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised , to build the house of Yahweh , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her : then he built Millo .
Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh three times a year , burning incense with them , on the altar that was before Yahweh . so he finished the house .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
Hiram sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
and the food of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their clothing , and his cup bearers , and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh ; there was no more spirit in her .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
blessed is Yahweh your God , who delighted in you , to set you on the throne of Israel . because Yahweh loved Israel forever , therefore made he you king , to do justice and righteousness . "
she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones . there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh , and for the king 's house , harps also and stringed instruments for the singers : there came no such almug trees , nor were seen , to this day .
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , that he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in droves , each drove at a price .
now king Solomon loved many foreign women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Sidonians , and Hittites ;
for it happened , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he didn 't keep that which Yahweh commanded .
therefore Yahweh said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
notwithstanding I will not do it in your days , for David your father 's sake ; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon , hadad the Edomite : he was of the king 's seed in Edom .
for it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain , and had struck every male in Edom
hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
when hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the army was dead , hadad said to Pharaoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
then Pharaoh said to him , " But what have you lacked with me , that behold , you seek to go to your own country ? " he answered , " Nothing , however only let me depart . "
Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite of Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
he said to Jeroboam , " Take ten pieces ; for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Behold , I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to you
" ' however I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand ; but I will make him prince all the days of his life , for David my servant 's sake whom I chose , who kept my commandments and my statutes ;
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam ; but Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a servant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . ' "
so Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king asked , saying , " Come to me again the third day . "
the king answered the people roughly , and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him ,
and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men , saying , " My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to your yoke . my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . "
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh , that he might establish his word , which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned , that they sent and called him to the congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah , and the tribe of Benjamin , a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and lived in it ; and he went out from there , and built Penuel .
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Rehoboam king of Judah ; and they will kill me , and return to Rehoboam king of Judah . "
he made houses of high places , and made priests from among all the people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart : and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel , and went up to the altar , to burn incense .
the king said to the man of God , " Come home with me , and refresh yourself , and I will give you a reward . "
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
now there lived an old prophet in Bethel ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
their father said to them , " Which way did he go ? " now his sons had seen which way the man of God went , who came from Judah .
he said to his sons , " Saddle the donkey for me . " so they saddled the donkey for him ; and he rode on it .
he went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak . he said to him , " Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? " he said , " I am . "
for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back ;
and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh , and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you ,
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " Eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
he laid his body in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , " Alas , my brother ! "
Jeroboam said to his wife , " Please get up and disguise yourself , that you won 't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam . go to Shiloh . behold , there is Ahijah the prophet , who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people .
Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . now Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
go , tell Jeroboam , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " because I exalted you from among the people , and made you prince over my people Israel ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yahweh has spoken it . " '
all Israel shall mourn for him , and bury him ; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh , the God of Israel , in the house of Jeroboam .
moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam . this is day ! what ? even now .
for they also built them high places , and pillars , and Asherim , on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
and there were also sodomites in the land : they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel .
it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ;
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and his mother 's name was Naamah the Ammonitess . Abijam his son reigned in his place .
now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah .
nevertheless for David 's sake , Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem ;
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
he put away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and Asa cut down her image , and burnt it at the brook Kidron .
he brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben hadad listened to king Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah ; none was exempted : and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
" because I exalted you out of the dust , and made you prince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam , and have made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him . now he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household in Tirzah :
and Zimri went in and struck him , and killed him , in the twenty @-@ seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet ,
for all the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , which they sinned , and with which they made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
in the twenty @-@ seventh year of Asa king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah . now the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
the people who were encamped heard say , Zimri has conspired , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver ; and he built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Shemer , the owner of the hill , Samaria .
Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and dealt wickedly above all who were before him .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
in the thirty @-@ eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty @-@ two years .
Ahab made the Asherah ; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
in his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho : he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn , and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun .
Elijah the Tishbite , who was of the foreigners of Gilead , said to Ahab , " As Yahweh , the God of Israel , lives , before whom I stand , there shall not be dew nor rain these years , but according to my word . "
" go away from here , turn eastward , and hide yourself by the brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
so he went and did according to the word of Yahweh ; for he went and lived by the brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
so he arose and went to Zarephath ; and when he came to the gate of the city , behold , a widow was there gathering sticks : and he called to her , and said , " Please get me a little water in a vessel , that I may drink . "
Elijah said to her , " Don 't be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little cake first , and bring it out to me , and afterward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
the jar of meal didn 't empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Elijah .
he stretched himself on the child three times , and cried to Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh my God , please let this child 's soul come into him again . "
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " Behold , your son lives . "
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
Ahab said to Obadiah , " Go through the land , to all the springs of water , and to all the brooks . perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive , that we not lose all the animals . "
as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he recognized him , and fell on his face , and said , " Is it you , my lord Elijah ? "
now you say , ' Go , tell your lord , " Behold , Elijah is here " ; ' and he will kill me . "
Elijah said , " As Yahweh of Armies lives , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself to him today . "
it happened , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said to him , " Is that you , you troubler of Israel ? "
he answered , " I have not troubled Israel ; but you , and your father 's house , in that you have forsaken the commandments of Yahweh , and you have followed the Baals .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel , and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal , and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah , who eat at Jezebel 's table . "
you call on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of Yahweh . the God who answers by fire , let him be God . " all the people answered , " It is well said . "
Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Elijah said to all the people , " Come near to me " ; and all the people came near to him . he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down .
with the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh . he made a trench around the altar , large enough to contain two measures of seed .
then the fire of Yahweh fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Yahweh , he is God ! Yahweh , he is God ! "
Elijah said to them , " Seize the prophets of Baal ! Don 't let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon , and killed them there .
Elijah said to Ahab , " Get up , eat and drink ; for there is the sound of abundance of rain . "
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
he said to his servant , " Go up now , look toward the sea . " he went up , and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " he said , " Go again " seven times .
the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah ; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
he lay down and slept under a juniper tree ; and behold , an angel touched him , and said to him , " Arise and eat ! "
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the coals , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
the angel of Yahweh came again the second time , and touched him , and said , " Arise and eat , because the journey is too great for you . "
he came there to a cave , and lodged there ; and behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , and he said to him , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
Yahweh said to him , " Go , return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus . when you arrive , you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria .
he left the oxen , and ran after Elijah , and said , " Let me please kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow you . " he said to him , " Go back again ; for what have I done to you ? "
Ben hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together ; and there were thirty @-@ two kings with him , and horses and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and fought against it .
the king of Israel answered , " It is according to your saying , my lord , O king . I am yours , and all that I have . "
Ben hadad sent to him , and said , " The gods do so to me , and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me . "
behold , a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Have you seen all this great multitude ? behold , I will deliver it into your hand this day ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh . ' "
he said , " If they have come out for peace , take them alive ; or if they have come out for war , take them alive . "
the prophet came near to the king of Israel , and said to him , " Go , strengthen yourself , and mark , and see what you do ; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you . "
but the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @-@ seven thousand men who were left . Ben hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh , " Please strike me ! " the man refused to strike him .
then he said to him , " Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh , behold , as soon as you are departed from me , a lion shall kill you . " as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and killed him .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
he hurried , and took the headband away from his eyes ; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets .
he said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction , therefore your life shall go for his life , and your people for his people . ' "
it happened after these things , that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard , which was in Jezreel , hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria .
Naboth said to Ahab , " May Yahweh forbid me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you ! "
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city , who lived with Naboth .
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned , and was dead , that Jezebel said to Ahab , " Arise , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , which he refused to give you for money ; for Naboth is not alive , but dead . "
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
Ahab said to Elijah , " Have you found me , my enemy ? " he answered , " I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh .
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel , saying , " The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel .
the dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
he did very abominably in following idols , according to all that the Amorites did , whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
" see how Ahab humbles himself before me ? because he humbles himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days ; but in his son 's days will I bring the evil on his house . "
the king of Israel said to his servants , " You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours , and we are still , and don 't take it out of the hand of the king of Syria ? "
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
all the prophets prophesied so , saying , " Go up to Ramoth Gilead , and prosper ; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king . "
the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him , saying , " See now , the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth . please let your word be like the word of one of them , and speak good . "
the king said to him , " How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh ? "
now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son .
say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace . " ' "
Micaiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Yahweh has not spoken by me . " he said , " Listen , all you people ! "
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " Surely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Jehoshaphat cried out .
the battle increased that day . the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians , and died at evening . the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot .
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the ivory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoshaphat was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
he walked in all the way of Asa his father ; He didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
the remnant of the sodomites , that remained in the days of his father Asa , he put away out of the land .
he served Baal , and worshiped him , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria , and was sick . so he sent messengers , and said to them , " Go , inquire of Baal Zebub , the god of Ekron , whether I will recover of this sickness . "
now therefore thus says Yahweh , " You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but shall surely die . " ' " Elijah departed .
the messengers returned to him , and he said to them , " Why is it that you have returned ? "
he said to them , " What kind of man was he who came up to meet you , and told you these words ? "
they answered him , " He was a hairy man , and wearing a leather belt around his waist . " he said , " It is Elijah the Tishbite . "
Elijah answered to the captain of fifty , " If I am a man of God , let fire come down from the sky , and consume you and your fifty ! " fire came down from the sky , and consumed him and his fifty .
again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty . he answered him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down quickly ! ' "
Elijah answered them , " If I am a man of God , let fire come down from the sky , and consume you and your fifty ! " the fire of God came down from the sky , and consumed him and his fifty .
the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah , " Go down with him . Don 't be afraid of him . " he arose , and went down with him to the king .
Elijah said to Elisha , " Please wait here , for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel . " Elisha said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they went down to Bethel .
the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha , and said to him , " Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today ? " he said , " Yes , I know it ; hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Elisha , please wait here , for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho . " he said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they came to Jericho .
the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha , and said to him , " Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today ? " he answered , " Yes , I know it . hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Please wait here , for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan . " he said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " they both went on .
fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood opposite them at a distance ; and they both stood by the Jordan .
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
it happened , when they had gone over , that Elijah said to Elisha , " Ask what I shall do for you , before I am taken from you . " Elisha said , " Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me . "
he said , " You have asked a hard thing . if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so . "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
they came back to him , while he stayed at Jericho ; and he said to them , " didn 't I tell you , ' Don 't go ? ' "
the men of the city said to Elisha , " Behold , please , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land miscarries . "
he said , " Bring me a new jar , and put salt in it . " they brought it to him .
he went out to the spring of the waters , and threw salt into it , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' I have healed these waters . there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying . ' "
he went up from there to Bethel . as he was going up by the way , some youths came out of the city and mocked him , and said to him , " Go up , you Baldy ! go up , you baldhead ! "
he looked behind him and saw them , and cursed them in the name of Yahweh . two female bears came out of the woods , and mauled forty @-@ two of those youths .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs , and of one hundred thousand rams .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
the king of Israel said , " Alas ! for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab . "
but Jehoshaphat said , " isn 't there here a prophet of Yahweh , that we may inquire of Yahweh by him ? " one of the king of Israel 's servants answered , " Elisha the son of Shaphat is here , who poured water on the hands of Elijah . "
Jehoshaphat said , " The word of Yahweh is with him . " so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
Elisha said , " As Yahweh of Armies lives , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward you , nor see you .
but now bring me a minstrel . " it happened , when the minstrel played , that the hand of Yahweh came on him .
for thus says Yahweh , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
you shall strike every fortified city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all springs of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ' "
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
they said , " This is blood . the kings are surely destroyed , and they have struck each other . now therefore , Moab , to the spoil ! "
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place , and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall . there was great wrath against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
Elisha said to her , " What shall I do for you ? tell me : what do you have in the house ? " she said , " Your handmaid has nothing in the house , except a pot of oil . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
he said , " What then is to be done for her ? " Gehazi answered , " Most certainly she has no son , and her husband is old . "
he said , " At this season , when the time comes around , you will embrace a son . " she said , " No , my lord , you man of God , do not lie to your handmaid . "
when the child was grown , it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers .
he said , " Why would you want go to him today ? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath . " she said , " It 's alright . "
please run now to meet her , and ask her , ' Is it well with you ? is it well with your husband ? is it well with the child ? ' " she answered , " It is well . "
the mother of the child said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " he arose , and followed her .
Gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staff on the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . therefore he returned to meet him , and told him , saying , " The child has not awakened . "
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stretched himself on him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stretched himself on him . then the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
he called Gehazi , and said , " Call this Shunammite ! " so he called her . when she had come in to him , he said , " Take up your son . "
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
Elisha came again to Gilgal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . "
but he said , " Then bring meal . " he cast it into the pot ; and he said , " Pour out for the people , that they may eat . " there was no harm in the pot .
his servant said , " What , should I set this before a hundred men ? " but he said , " Give the people , that they may eat ; for thus says Yahweh , ' They will eat , and will have some left over . ' "
so he set it before them , and they ate , and left some of it , according to the word of Yahweh .
now Naaman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of valor , but he was a leper .
the king of Syria said , " Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel . " he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy . "
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
but Naaman was angry , and went away , and said , " Behold , I thought , ' He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Yahweh his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the leper . '
aren 't Abanah and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? couldn 't I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . when Naaman saw one running after him , he came down from the chariot to meet him , and said , " Is all well ? "
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . Elisha said to him , " Where did you come from , Gehazi ? " he said , " Your servant went nowhere . "
the sons of the prophets said to Elisha , " See now , the place where we dwell before you is too small for us .
the man of God asked , " Where did it fall ? " he showed him the place . he cut down a stick , threw it in there , and made the iron float .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " Won 't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
he said , " Go and see where he is , that I may send and get him . " it was told him , saying , " Behold , he is in Dothan . "
therefore he sent horses , chariots , and a great army there . they came by night , and surrounded the city .
when the servant of the man of God had risen early , and gone out , behold , an army with horses and chariots was around the city . his servant said to him , " Alas , my master ! what shall we do ? "
when they came down to him , Elisha prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
it happened , when they had come into Samaria , that Elisha said , " Yahweh , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yahweh opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
there was a great famine in Samaria . behold , they besieged it , until a donkey 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a Kab of dove 's dung for five pieces of silver .
he said , " If Yahweh doesn 't help you , from where could I help you ? from of the threshing floor , or from the winepress ? "
while he was still talking with them , behold , the messenger came down to him . then he said , " Behold , this evil is from Yahweh . why should I wait for Yahweh any longer ? "
Elisha said , " Hear the word of Yahweh . thus says Yahweh , ' Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the gate of Samaria . ' "
now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate . they said one to another , " Why do we sit here until we die ?
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
the people went out , and plundered the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of Yahweh .
the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate : and the people trod on him in the gate , and he died as the man of God had said , who spoke when the king came down to him .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , " Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done . "
the king said to Hazael , " Take a present in your hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of Yahweh by him , saying , ' Will I recover from this sickness ? ' "
Elisha said to him , " Go , tell him , ' You shall surely recover ; ' however Yahweh has shown me that he shall surely die . "
Hazael said , " But what is your servant , who is but a dog , that he should do this great thing ? " Elisha answered , " Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria . "
then he departed from Elisha , and came to his master , who said to him , " What did Elisha say to you ? " he answered , " He told me that you would surely recover . "
it happened on the next day , that he took a thick cloth , dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Hazael reigned in his place .
in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
twenty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when you come there , find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
then take the vial of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I have anointed you king over Israel . " ' then open the door , flee , and don 't wait . "
he arose , and went into the house . then he poured the oil on his head , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh , even over Israel .
you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said to him , " Is all well ? why did this mad fellow come to you ? " he said to them , " You know the man and what his talk was . "
then they hurried , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew the trumpet , saying , " Jehu is king . "
now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel , and he spied the company of Jehu as he came , and said , " I see a company . " Joram said , " Take a horseman , and send to meet them , and let him say , ' Is it peace ? ' "
then he sent out a second on horseback , who came to them , and said , " Thus says the king , ' Is it peace ? ' " Jehu answered , " What do you have to do with peace ? fall in behind me ! "
Joram said , " Get ready ! " they got his chariot ready . Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out , each in his chariot , and they went out to meet Jehu , and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite .
it happened , when Joram saw Jehu , that he said , " Is it peace , Jehu ? " he answered , " What peace , so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound ? "
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
when he had come in , he ate and drink ; and he said , " See now to this cursed woman , and bury her ; for she is a king 's daughter . "
therefore they came back , and told him . he said , " This is the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , ' The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel ,
now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , to the rulers of Jezreel , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab , saying ,
but they were exceedingly afraid , and said , " Behold , the two kings didn 't stand before him ! how then shall we stand ? "
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
a messenger came , and told him , " They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . " he said , " Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning . "
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh , which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab . for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
Jehu gathered all the people together , and said to them , " Ahab served Baal a little ; but Jehu will serve him much .
Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that didn 't come . they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin .
from the Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , even Gilead and Bashan .
in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard , and brought them to him into the house of Yahweh ; and he made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh , and showed them the king 's son .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
then he brought out the king 's son , and put the crown on him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , " Long live the king ! "
in the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah of Beersheba .
however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
and to the masons and the stone cutters , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;
moreover they didn 't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the trespass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Yahweh : it was the priests ' .
for Jozacar the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , struck him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Amaziah his son reigned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died : and Joash the king of Israel came down to him , and wept over him , and said , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! "
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
he said , " Take the arrows " ; and he took them . he said to the king of Israel , " Strike the ground " ; and he struck three times , and stopped .
the man of God was angry with him , and said , " You should have struck five or six times . then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it , whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times . "
but Yahweh was gracious to them , and had compassion on them , and had respect to them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war . Joash struck him three times , and recovered the cities of Israel .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen . so Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth Shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any helper for Israel .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
Yahweh struck the king , so that he was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house . Jotham the king 's son was over the household , judging the people of the land .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as his fathers had done : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty @-@ ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned for a month in Samaria .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Menahem exacted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . so the king of Assyria turned back , and didn 't stay there in the land .
Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and struck him , and killed him , and reigned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places . he built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh .
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God , like David his father .
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria listened to him ; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried its people captive to Kir , and killed Rezin .
King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath pileser king of Assyria , and saw the altar that was at Damascus ; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar , and its pattern , according to all its workmanship .
Urijah the priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases , and removed the basin from off them , and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it , and put it on a pavement of stone .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger ;
and they served idols , of which Yahweh had said to them , " You shall not do this thing . "
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
for he tore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh , and made them sin a great sin .
so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they didn 't fear Yahweh : therefore Yahweh sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , " Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the law of the god of the land . "
however every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared Yahweh , and served their own gods , after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away .
but you shall fear Yahweh your God ; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies . "
now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Asherah : and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it ; and he called it Nehushtan .
he trusted in Yahweh , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
at the end of three years they took it : in the sixth year of Hezekiah , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah , and took them .
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Say now to Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now , behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised reed , even in Egypt . if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand , and pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebnah , and Joah , said to Rabshakeh , " Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it . Don 't speak with us in the Jews ' language , in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
Don 't listen to Hezekiah . ' for thus says the king of Assyria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone of you eat of his vine , and everyone of his fig tree , and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern ;
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
but the people held their peace , and answered him not a word ; for the king 's commandment was , " Don 't answer him . "
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
incline your ear , Yahweh , and hear . open your eyes , Yahweh , and see . hear the words of Sennacherib , with which he has sent to defy the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us , I beg you , out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you , Yahweh , are God alone . "
then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria , I have heard you .
this is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him : " the virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt . '
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like grain blasted before it has grown up .
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
in those days was Hezekiah sick to death . Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order ; for you shall die , and not live . ' "
" remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day ? "
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
Hezekiah answered , " It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps . nay , but let the shadow return backward ten steps . "
then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah , and said to him , " What did these men say ? from where did they come to you ? " Hezekiah said , " They have come from a far country , even from Babylon . "
'Behold , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Babylon . nothing shall be left , ' says Yahweh .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hephzibah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made an Asherah , as did Ahab king of Israel , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria , and the plummet of the house of Ahab ; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish , wiping it and turning it upside down .
I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
to the carpenters , and to the builders , and to the masons , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house .
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh . "
Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , " Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me . " Shaphan read it before the king .
the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' Behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
he brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh , outside of Jerusalem , to the brook Kidron , and burned it at the brook Kidron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the priests of the high places didn 't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem , but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers .
he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
as Josiah turned himself , he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain ; and he sent , and took the bones out of the tombs , and burned them on the altar , and defiled it , according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these things .
he said , " Let him be ! let no man move his bones . " so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria .
the king commanded all the people , saying , " Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God , as it is written in this book of the covenant . "
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
Yahweh said , " I will remove Judah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and I will cast off this city which I have chosen , even Jerusalem , and the house of which I said , ' My name shall be there . ' "
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .
surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ,
and also for the innocent blood that he shed ; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood : and Yahweh would not pardon .
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his father had done .
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh 's temple , as Yahweh had said .
he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valor , even ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and the smiths ; none remained , except the poorest sort of the people of the land .
he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon ; and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the chief men of the land , carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
all the men of might , even seven thousand , and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand , all of them strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
the king of Babylon made Mattaniah , Jehoiachin 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
for through the anger of Yahweh , it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it around it .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , to Jerusalem .
he burnt the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
but the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields .
the Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh , and carried the brass pieces to Babylon .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits , and a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the capital was three cubits , with network and pomegranates on the capital around it , all of brass : and like to these had the second pillar with network .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
as for the people who were left in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , governor .
but it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal seed came , and ten men with him , and struck Gedaliah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah .
all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .

the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
all the valiant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
so Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh , because of the word of Yahweh , which he didn 't keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inquire ,
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel .
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , the son of a Hachmonite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time .
he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
they stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David longed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
the three broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh ,
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
behold , he was more honorable than the thirty , but he didn 't attain to the three : and David set him over his guard .
Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Berothite , the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah ,
now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish ; and they were among the mighty men , his helpers in war .
the chief was Ahiezer ; then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth , and Beracah , and Jehu the Anathothite ,
and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Jozabad the Gederathite ,
of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness , mighty men of valor , men trained for war , that could handle shield and spear ; whose faces were like the faces of lions , and they were as swift as the roes on the mountains ;
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zillethai , captains of thousands who were of Manasseh .
they helped David against the band of rovers : for they were all mighty men of valor , and were captains in the army .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father 's house twenty @-@ two captains .
of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , who were mentioned by name , to come and make David king .
of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .
all these being men of war , who could order the battle array , came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us . for we didn 't seek it in the days of Saul . "
so David assembled all Israel together , from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath , to bring the ark of God from Kiriath jearim .
David went up , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kiriath jearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim , that is called by the Name .
David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , and with harps , and with stringed instruments , and with tambourines , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
the ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ Edom in his house three months : and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed @-@ Edom , and all that he had .
these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
David inquired of God , saying , " Shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to him , " Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . "
David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mulberry trees .
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
then David said , " No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites . for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God , and to minister to him forever . "
the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
and with them their brothers of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , the doorkeepers .
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with stringed instruments set to Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed lyre , to lead .
Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was over the song : he instructed about the song , because he was skillful .
Shebaniah , and Joshaphat , and Nethanel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew the trumpets before the ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
it happened , when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams .
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ephod of linen .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , with stringed instruments and with harps ; and Asaph with cymbals , sounding aloud ;
Oh give thanks to Yahweh . call on his name . make his doings known among the peoples .
he confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant ,
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ! let them say among the nations , " Yahweh reigns ! "
say , " Save us , God of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . "
blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting . all the people said , " Amen , " and praised Yahweh .
so he left there , before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
and Zadok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
" go and tell David my servant , ' Thus says Yahweh , " You shall not build me a house to dwell in ;
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , " Who am I , Yahweh God , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
what can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant .
Yahweh , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Yahweh , have blessed , and it is blessed forever . "
David took from him one thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
from Tibhath and from Cun , cities of Hadadezer , David took very much brass , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
King David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Arammaacah , and out of Zobah .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captain of the army .
he brought forth the people who were therein , and cut them with saws , and with iron picks , and with axes . David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon . David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @-@ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .
these were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David said to Joab and to the princes of the people , " Go , number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan ; and bring me word , that I may know the sum of them . "
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
" go and speak to David , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let me fall , I pray , into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
Ornan said to David , " Take it for yourself , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes . behold , I give the oxen for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meal offering . I give it all . "
King David said to Ornan , " No ; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price . for I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh , nor offer a burnt offering without cost . "
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
but David couldn 't go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
behold , a son shall be born to you , who shall be a man of rest . I will give him rest from all his enemies all around ; for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever . '
may Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed .
" isn 't Yahweh your God with you ? hasn 't he given you rest on every side ? for he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand ; and the land is subdued before Yahweh , and before his people .
now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn 't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
the sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn incense before Yahweh , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever .
for by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered , from twenty years old and upward .
and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the Sabbaths , on the new moons , and on the set feasts , in number according to the ordinance concerning them , continually before Yahweh ;
these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron : Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
this was their ordering in their service , to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yahweh , the God of Israel , had commanded him .
of the rest of the sons of Levi : of the sons of Amram , Shubael ; of the sons of Shubael , Jehdeiah .
of Jeduthun ; the sons of Jeduthun : Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp , who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh .
all these were the sons of heman the king 's seer in the words of God , to lift up the horn . God gave to heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
they cast lots for their offices , all alike , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholar .
for the divisions of the doorkeepers : of the Korahites , Meshelemiah the son of Kore , of the sons of Asaph .
Obed @-@ Edom had sons : Shemaiah the firstborn , Jehozabad the second , Joah the third , and Sacar the fourth , and Nethanel the fifth ,
also to Shemaiah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were mighty men of valor .
the sons of Shemaiah : Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brothers were valiant men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yahweh .
of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brothers , men of valor , one thousand seven hundred , had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward , for all the business of Yahweh , and for the service of the king .
over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite , and his division ; and Mikloth the ruler : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada the priest , chief : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
this is that Benaiah , who was the mighty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Ammizabad his son .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh in Gilead , Iddo the son of Zechariah : of Benjamin , Jaasiel the son of Abner :
of Dan , Azarel the son of Jeroham . these were the captains of the tribes of Israel .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but didn 't finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
also Jonathan , David 's uncle , was a counselor , a man of understanding , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar : and the captain of the king 's army was Joab .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
take heed now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary . be strong , and do it . "
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
by weight also for the lampstands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps ; and for the lampstands of silver , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lampstand ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the forks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot , the cherubim , that spread out , and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
yours , Yahweh , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the majesty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Yahweh , and you are exalted as head above all .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
Yahweh , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people , and prepare their heart for you ;
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Yahweh your God ! " all the assembly blessed Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king .
they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh , and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bulls , one thousand rams , and one thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
all the princes , the mighty men , and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the Tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
but David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath jearim to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh , which was at the Tent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the Tent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he reigned over Israel .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue ; the king 's merchants purchased them from Kue .
but who is able to build him a house , since heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain him ? who am I then , that I should build him a house , except just to burn incense before him ?
" send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon : and behold , my servants shall be with your servants ,
Huram continued , " Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endowed with discretion and understanding , that should build a house for Yahweh , and a house for his kingdom .
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @-@ three thousand six hundred .
he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens , and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the porch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
the greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood , which he overlaid with fine gold , and ornamented it with palm trees and chains .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
he made the most holy house : its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and its breadth twenty cubits ; and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work ; and they overlaid them with gold .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @-@ five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
he made chains in the oracle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
then he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits its length , and twenty cubits its breadth , and ten cubits its height .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basins . so Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in God 's house , the golden altar also , and the tables with the show bread on them ;
and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
and they brought up the ark , and the Tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb , when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of Yahweh filled God 's house .
but I have built you a house of habitation , and a place for you to dwell in forever . "
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
" Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
he stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" but will God indeed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house which I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and to his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the petitions of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : yes , hear from your dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and do , and judge your servants , bringing retribution to the wicked , to bring his way on his own head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear from heaven , your dwelling place and forgive , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your outstretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity , saying , ' We have sinned , we have done perversely , and have dealt wickedly ; '
" now therefore arise , Yahweh God , into your resting place , you , and the ark of your strength : let your priests , Yahweh God , be clothed with salvation , and let your saints rejoice in goodness .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @-@ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
so Solomon held the feast at that time seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly , from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt .
on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yahweh , and in his own house .
Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
" if I shut up the sky so that there is no rain , or if I command the locust to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
if my people , who are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth Horon the upper , and Beth Horon the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Baalath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel didn 't consume , of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers of king Solomon , even two @-@ hundred fifty , who ruled over the people .
then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh , which he had built before the porch ,
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the set feasts , three times in the year , in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
they didn 't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh , and for the king 's house , and harps and stringed instruments for the singers : and there were none like these seen before in the land of Judah .
besides that which the traders and merchants brought : and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
for the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
" your father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make you the grievous service of your father , and his heavy yoke which he put on us , lighter , and we will serve you . "
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you are kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . ' "
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was brought about of God , that Yahweh might establish his word , which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
'Thus says Yahweh , " You shall not go up , nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house ; for this thing is of me . " ' " so they listened to the words of Yahweh , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
after them , out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and sixty concubines , and became the father of twenty @-@ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin , to every fortified city : and he gave them food in abundance . he sought for them many wives .
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam , and to the princes of Judah , who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , ' You have forsaken me , therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak . ' "
when Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves , the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah , saying , " They have humbled themselves . I will not destroy them ; but I will grant them some deliverance , and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
nevertheless they shall be his servants , that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries . "
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , who were mighty men of valor .
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
" now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David ; and you are a great multitude , and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods .
" but as for us , Yahweh is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and we have priests ministering to Yahweh , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites in their work :
behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don 't fight against Yahweh , the God of your fathers ; for you shall not prosper . "
when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Yahweh , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
but Abijah grew mighty , and took to himself fourteen wives , and became the father of twenty @-@ two sons , and sixteen daughters .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and Asa his son reigned in his place . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
for he took away the foreign altars , and the high places , and broke down the pillars , and cut down the Asherim ,
and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
ASA had an army that bore bucklers and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bore shields and drew bows , two hundred eighty thousand : all these were mighty men of valor .
there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred chariots ; and he came to Mareshah .
he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and those who lived with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon : for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him .
they swore to Yahweh with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa , Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
" let there be a treaty between me and you , as there was between my father and your father . behold , I have sent you silver and gold . go , break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me . "
Ben hadad listened to king Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Maim , and all the storage cities of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Yahweh your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
then Asa was angry with the seer , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . ASA oppressed some of the people at the same time .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which Asa his father had taken .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben Hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethanel , and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
the fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and silver for tribute ; the Arabians also brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats .
he had many works in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Yahweh ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
these were those who waited on the king , besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah .
after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead .
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
but Jehoshaphat said , " isn 't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides , that we may inquire of him ? "
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him , saying , " Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth . let your word therefore , please be like one of theirs , and speak good . "
when he had come to the king , the king said to him , " Micaiah , shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? " he said , " Go up , and prosper . they shall be delivered into your hand . "
Yahweh said , ' Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ' one spoke saying in this way , and another saying in that way .
" now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
and say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace . " ' "
Micaiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Yahweh has not spoken by me . " he said , " Listen , you peoples , all of you ! "
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Jehoshaphat cried out , and Yahweh helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , " Should you help the wicked , and love those who hate Yahweh ? because of this , wrath is on you from before Yahweh .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yahweh , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
then some came who told Jehoshaphat , saying , " A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria . behold , they are in Hazazon Tamar " ( that is , En Gedi ) .
Judah gathered themselves together , to seek help from Yahweh . they came out of all the cities of Judah to seek Yahweh .
now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir , whom you would not let Israel invade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned aside from them , and didn 't destroy them ;
and he said , " Listen , all Judah , and you inhabitants of Jerusalem , and you king Jehoshaphat . thus says Yahweh to you , ' Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh , worshipping Yahweh .
when he had taken counsel with the people , he appointed those who should sing to Yahweh , and give praise in holy array , as they went out before the army , and say , Give thanks to Yahweh ; for his loving kindness endures forever .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , everyone helped to destroy another .
when Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah ; for there they blessed Yahweh : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
he had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
their father gave them great gifts , of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fortified cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram , because he was the firstborn .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
then Jehoram passed over with his captains , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , along with the captains of the chariots .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , and led Judah astray .
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , like the house of Ahab did , and also have slain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
thirty @-@ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years : and he departed without being desired ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place ; for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
forty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
all the assembly made a covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " Behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Bring her out between the ranks ; and whoever follows her , let him be slain with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don 't kill her in the Yahweh 's house . "
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
he set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh , that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
he gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to them , " Go out to the cities of Judah , and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year . see that you expedite this matter . " however the Levites didn 't do it right away .
they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
so the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh .
thus Joash the king didn 't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . "
for the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men ; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand , because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers . so they executed judgment on Joash .
these are those who conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
a man of God came to him , saying , " O king , don 't let the army of Israel go with you ; for Yahweh is not with Israel , with all the children of Ephraim .
Amaziah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
but the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell on the cities of Judah , from Samaria even to Beth Horon , and struck of them three thousand , and took much spoil .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen ; for it was of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they had sought after the gods of Edom .
so Joash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in God 's house with Obed @-@ Edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jechiliah , of Jerusalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
he built towers in the wilderness , and dug out many cisterns , for he had much livestock ; in the lowland also , and in the plain : and he had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields ; for he loved farming .
moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men , who went out to war by bands , according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king 's captains .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared for them , even for all the army , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and stones for slinging .
he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by skillful men , to be on the towers and on the battlements , with which to shoot arrows and great stones . his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvelously helped , until he was strong .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
then Uzziah was angry ; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense ; and while he was angry with the priests , the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh , beside the altar of incense .
Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , wrote .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a leper . " Jotham his son reigned in his place .
Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he didn 't enter into Yahweh 's temple . the people still did corruptly .
moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them valiant men ; because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the captives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you . "
then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war ,
Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh ; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yahweh , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem , and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth , to be an astonishment , and a hissing , as you see with your eyes .
now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don 't be negligent now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn incense . "
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh 's temple into the court of the house of Yahweh . the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of Yahweh . "
then Hezekiah the king arose early , and gathered the princes of the city , and went up to the house of Yahweh .
they brought seven bulls , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven male goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah . he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Yahweh .
he set the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals , with stringed instruments , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king 's seer , and Nathan the prophet ; for the commandment was of Yahweh by his prophets .
Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar . when the burnt offering began , the song of Yahweh began also , and the trumpets , together with the instruments of David king of Israel .
all the assembly worshiped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls , one hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
Hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , because of that which God had prepared for the people : for the thing was done suddenly .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
now don 't be stiff @-@ necked , as your fathers were ; but yield yourselves to Yahweh , and enter into his sanctuary , which he has sanctified forever , and serve Yahweh your God , that his fierce anger may turn away from you .
so the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even to Zebulun : but they ridiculed them , and mocked them .
also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart , to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness ; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day , singing with loud instruments to Yahweh .
Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh . so they ate throughout the feast for the seven days , offering sacrifices of peace offerings , and making confession to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh .
the children of Israel and Judah , who lived in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep , and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God , and laid them by heaps .
Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the porter at the east gate , was over the freewill offerings of God , to distribute the offerings of Yahweh , and the most holy things .
besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males , from three years old and upward , even everyone who entered into the house of Yahweh , as the duty of every day required , for their service in their offices according to their divisions ;
and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers ' houses , and the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their offices by their divisions ;
in every work that he began in the service of God 's house , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? "
he took courage , and built up all the wall that was broken down , and raised it up to the towers , and the other wall outside , and strengthened Millo in the city of David , and made weapons and shields in abundance .
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us , and to fight our battles . " the people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
hasn 't the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , ' You shall worship before one altar , and on it you shall burn incense ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
Hezekiah the king , and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , prayed because of this , and cried to heaven .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem , and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah ; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick even to death : and he prayed to Yahweh ; and he spoke to him , and gave him a sign .
but Hezekiah didn 't render again according to the benefit done to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath on him , and on Judah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
however concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . Manasseh his son reigned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down ; and he reared up altars for the Baals , and made Asheroth , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers , if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them , even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses . "
therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh in chains , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
he built up the altar of Yahweh , and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving , and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Asherim , and the engraved images , and the molten images .
he broke down the altars , and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder , and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel , and returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of Yahweh his God .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service : and of the Levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh , Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses .
Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
Shaphan carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
so Hilkiah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Yahweh , ' Behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
his princes gave for a freewill offering to the people , to the priests , and to the Levites . Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , the rulers of God 's house , gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock , and three hundred head of cattle .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yahweh , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
afterward they prepared for themselves , and for the priests , because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night : therefore the Levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem , and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God ; he didn 't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
" thus says Cyrus king of Persia , ' Yahweh , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
even those , Cyrus king of Persia brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them to Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . Sheshbazzar brought all these up , when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem .
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Seraiah , Reelaiah , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispar , Bigvai , Rehum , Baanah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy @-@ four .
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred singing men and singing women .
their camels , four hundred thirty @-@ five ; their donkeys , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty @-@ one thousand darics of gold , and five thousand Minas of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up with his brothers the priests , and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers , and built the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings thereon , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new moons , of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated , and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh ; but the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was not yet laid .
when the builders laid the foundation of Yahweh 's temple , they set the priests in their clothing with trumpets , with the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals , to praise Yahweh , according to the directions of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
then Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions , the Dinaites , and the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanchites , the Dehaites , the Elamites ,
be it known to the king , that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem ; they are building the rebellious and the bad city , and have finished the walls , and repaired the foundations .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dishonor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
now the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
at the same time came to them Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and their companions , and said thus to them , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were beyond the River , sent to Darius the king ;
then we asked those elders , and said to them thus , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon , Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God .
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
with three courses of great stones , and a course of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king 's house .
now therefore , Tattenai , governor beyond the River , Shetharbozenai , and your companions the Apharsachites , who are beyond the River , you must stay far from there .
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
the elders of the Jews built and prospered , through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo . they built and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the decree of Cyrus , and Darius , and Artaxerxes king of Persia .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy : for Yahweh had made them joyful , and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them , to strengthen their hands in the work of God 's house , the God of Israel .
now after these things , in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia , Ezra the son of Seraiah , the son of Azariah , the son of Hilkiah ,
this Ezra went up from Babylon : and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses , which Yahweh , the God of Israel , had given ; and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of Yahweh his God on him .
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ;
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls , rams , lambs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , the singers , porters , Nethinim , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose tribute , custom , or toll , on them .
whoever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all diligence , whether it be to death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Adonikam , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , who were teachers .
I sent them forth to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia ; and I told them what they should tell Iddo , and his brothers the Nethinim , at the place Casiphia , that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God .
and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were mentioned by name .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river Ahava , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of him a straight way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his counselors , and his princes , and all Israel there present , had offered :
I said to them , " You are holy to Yahweh , and the vessels are holy ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh , the God of your fathers .
so the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go to Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was on us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass . "
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
shall we again break your commandments , and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations ? wouldn 't you be angry with us until you had consumed us , so that there should be no remnant , nor any to escape ?
Shecaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of ELAM , answered Ezra , " We have trespassed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
arise ; for the matter belongs to you , and we are with you . be courageous , and do it . "
then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they swore .
they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
and that whoever didn 't come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity .
Ezra the priest stood up , and said to them , " You have trespassed , and have married foreign women , to increase the guilt of Israel .
now therefore make confession to Yahweh , the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure ; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign women . "
among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and his brothers , Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
of Israel : of the sons of Parosh : Ramiah , and Izziah , and Malchijah , and Mijamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
they said to me , " The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
we have dealt very corruptly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you trespass , I will scatter you abroad among the peoples ;
" now these are your servants and your people , whom you have redeemed by your great power , and by your strong hand .
it happened in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
the king said to me , " Why is your face sad , since you are not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . " then I was very much afraid .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shouldn 't my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tombs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
I said to the king , " If it pleases the king , and if your servant has found favor in your sight , that you would send me to Judah , to the city of my fathers ' tombs , that I may build it . "
the king said to me ( the queen was also sitting by him ) , " For how long shall your journey be ? and when will you return ? " so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
moreover I said to the king , " If it pleases the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the spring gate and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass .
the rulers didn 't know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
then I said to them , " You see the evil case that we are in , how Jerusalem lies waste , and its gates are burned with fire . come , let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we won 't be disgraced . "
I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me , as also of the king 's words that he had spoken to me . they said , " Let 's rise up and build . " so they strengthened their hands for the good work .
then answered I them , and said to them , " The God of heaven will prosper us . therefore we , his servants , will arise and build ; but you have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem . "
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it , to the tower of Hananel .
the sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
next to them , Meremoth the son of Uriah , the son of Hakkoz made repairs . next to them , Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabel made repairs . next to them , Zadok the son of Baana made repairs .
next to them , the Tekoites made repairs ; but their nobles didn 't put their necks to the work of their lord .
Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the old gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , and its bolts , and its bars .
next to him , Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , goldsmiths , made repairs . next to him , Hananiah one of the perfumers made repairs , and they fortified Jerusalem even to the broad wall .
next to them , Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs across from his house . next to him , Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs .
Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the valley gate . they built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars , and one thousand cubits of the wall to the dung gate .
Malchijah the son of Rechab , the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the dung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
next to him , Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , repaired another portion , across from the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion , from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
after him , Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another portion , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .
after them , Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs across from their house . after them , Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made repairs beside his own house .
after him , Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another portion , from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall , and to the corner .
( now the Nethinim lived in Ophel , to the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that stands out . )
after them , Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house . after him , Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah , the keeper of the east gate made repairs .
now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , " What they are building , if a fox climbed up it , he would break down their stone wall . "
" hear , our God ; for we are despised ; and turn back their reproach on their own head , give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity ;
Don 't cover their iniquity , and don 't let their sin be blotted out from before you ; for they have insulted the builders . "
but it happened that when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabians , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
our adversaries said , " They shall not know , neither see , until we come into their midst , and kill them , and cause the work to cease . "
it happened that when the Jews who lived by them came , they said to us ten times from all places , " Wherever you turn , they will attack us . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
I said to the nobles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
for there were that said , " We , our sons and our daughters , are many . let us get grain , that we may eat and live . "
some also there were that said , " We are mortgaging our fields , and our vineyards , and our houses . let us get grain , because of the famine . "
then I consulted with myself , and contended with the nobles and the rulers , and said to them , " You exact usury , everyone of his brother . " I held a great assembly against them .
also I said , " The thing that you do is not good . ought you not to walk in the fear of our God , because of the reproach of the nations our enemies ?
please restore to them , even this day , their fields , their vineyards , their olive groves , and their houses , also the hundredth part of the money , and of the grain , the new wine , and the oil , that you are charging them . "
then they said , " We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do , even as you say . " then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they would do according to this promise .
that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me , saying , " Come , let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono . " but they intended to harm me .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can 't come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
in which was written , " It is reported among the nations , and Gashmu says it , that you and the Jews intend to rebel . because of that , you are building the wall . you would be their king , according to these words .
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Judah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
for they all would have made us afraid , saying , " Their hands will be weakened from the work , that it not be done . but now , strengthen my hands . "
I said , " Should such a man as I flee ? who is there that , being such as I , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in . "
" remember , my God , Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works , and also the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear . "
so the wall was finished in the twenty @-@ fifth day of Elul , in fifty @-@ two days .
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
for there were many in Judah sworn to him , because he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of Shecaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these searched for their geneological records , but couldn 't find them . therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred forty @-@ five singing men and singing women .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand two hundred Minas of silver .
Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday , in the presence of the men and the women , and of those who could understand ; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law .
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and Ezra blessed Yahweh , the great God . all the people answered , " Amen , Amen , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground .
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , " Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be grieved . "
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
they found written in the law , how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month ;
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves booths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim .
now in the twenty @-@ fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackcloth , and earth on them .
then Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs , and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God .
you are Yahweh , the God who chose Abram , and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gave him the name of Abraham ,
and found his heart faithful before you , and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite , and the Girgashite , to give it to his seed , and have performed your words ; for you are righteous .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
yes , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful blasphemies ;
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples , which you allotted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
" so the children went in and possessed the land , and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gave them into their hands , with their kings , and the peoples of the land , that they might do with them as they pleased .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
however you are just in all that has come on us ; for you have dealt truly , but we have done wickedly ;
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
yet for all this , we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , our Levites , and our priests , seal it . "
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
also we made ordinances for ourselves , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ;
the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem ; but in the cities of Judah everyone lived in his possession in their cities : Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @-@ two ; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashhur , the son of Malchijah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fathers ' households , two hundred forty @-@ two ; and Amashsai the son of Azarel , the son of Ahzai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brothers , mighty men of valor , one hundred twenty @-@ eight ; and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of Haggedolim .
of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
and Mattaniah the son of Mica , the son of Zabdi , the son of Asaph , who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer , and Bakbukiah , the second among his brothers ; and Abda the son of Shammua , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun .
moreover the porters , Akkub , Talmon , and their brothers , who kept watch at the gates , were one hundred seventy @-@ two .
the overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Mica , of the sons of Asaph , the singers , over the business of God 's house .
Sallu , amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah . these were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest the scribe .
then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate ;
and his brothers , Shemaiah , and Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ; and Ezra the scribe was before them .
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
they offered great sacrifices that day , and rejoiced ; for God had made them rejoice with great joy ; and the women also and the children rejoiced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
because they didn 't meet the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , to curse them : however our God turned the curse into a blessing .
now before this , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tobiah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frankincense .
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
then I contended with the rulers , and said , " Why is God 's house forsaken ? " I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said to them , " What evil thing is this that you do , and profane the Sabbath day ?
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Why do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they didn 't come on the Sabbath .
I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the Sabbath day . remember to me , my God , this also , and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the first fruits . remember me , my God , for good .
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcass , the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king ,
and the next to him were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan , the seven princes of Persia and Media , who saw the king 's face , and sat first in the kingdom ) ,
" what shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law , because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs ? "
Memucan answered before the king and the princes , " Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the princes , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she didn 't come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
there was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Esther was doing , and what would become of her .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
the king loved Esther more than all the women , and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants , even Esther 's feast ; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces , and gave gifts according to the king 's bounty .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
this thing became known to Mordecai , who informed Esther the queen ; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai 's name .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bowed down , and paid homage to Haman ; for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai didn 't bow down or pay him homage .
the king said to Haman , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that they should be ready against that day .
the couriers went forth in haste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa . the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
he came even before the king 's gate , for no one is allowed inside the king 's gate clothed with sackcloth .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther , " Don 't think to yourself that you will escape in the king 's house any more than all the Jews .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Esther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
Esther said , " If it seems good to the king , let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him . "
then the king said , " Bring Haman quickly , so that it may be done as Esther has said . " so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
if I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king has said . "
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Haman also said , " Yes , Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king 's eunuchs , who were doorkeepers , who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
the king said , " What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this ? " then the king 's servants who attended him said , " Nothing has been done for him . "
the king said , " Who is in the court ? " now Haman had come into the outer court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
so Haman came in . the king said to him , " What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ? " now Haman said in his heart , " Who would the king delight to honor more than myself ? "
let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear , and the horse that the king rides on , and on the head of which a crown royal is set .
then the king said to Haman , " Hurry and take the clothing and the horse , as you have said , and do this for Mordecai the Jew , who sits at the king 's gate . let nothing fail of all that you have spoken . "
then Haman took the clothing and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai , and had him ride through the city square , and proclaimed before him , " Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ! "
the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition , queen Esther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
Esther said , " An adversary and an enemy , even this wicked Haman ! " then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden . Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
on that day , King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman , the Jews ' enemy , to Esther the queen . Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was to her .
Esther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , " See , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged on the gallows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by courier on horseback , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds .
on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a robe of fine linen and purple ; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus , to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them . no one could withstand them , because the fear of them had fallen on all the people .
all the princes of the provinces , the satraps , the governors , and those who did the king 's business helped the Jews , because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
on that day , the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king .
the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and killed three hundred men in Shushan ; but they didn 't lay their hand on the spoil .
this was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
but the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month ; and on the fifteenth day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
therefore they called these days " Purim , " from the word " Pur . " therefore because of all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and that which had come to them ,
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai , to which the king advanced him , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job . that man was blameless and upright , and one who feared God , and turned away from evil .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
now it happened on the day when God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan also came among them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Have you considered my servant , Job ? for there is none like him in the earth , a blameless and an upright man , one who fears God , and turns away from evil . "
haven 't you made a hedge around him , and around his house , and around all that he has , on every side ? you have blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
but put forth your hand now , and touch all that he has , and he will renounce you to your face . "
while he was still speaking , there also came another , and said , " The fire of God has fallen from the sky , and has burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " The Chaldeans made three bands , and swept down on the camels , and have taken them away , yes , and killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
and behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and struck the four corners of the house , and it fell on the young men , and they are dead . I alone have escaped to tell you . "
then Job arose , and tore his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshiped .
he said , " Naked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Yahweh gave , and Yahweh has taken away . blessed be the name of Yahweh . "
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh .
but put forth your hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will renounce you to your face . "
so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh , and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head .
but he said to her , " You speak as one of the foolish women would speak . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? " in all this Job didn 't sin with his lips .
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and didn 't recognize him , they raised their voices , and wept ; and they each tore his robe , and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky .
" let the day perish in which I was born , the night which said , ' There is a boy conceived . '
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terrify it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
how much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth !
he frustrates the devices of the crafty , So that their hands can 't perform their enterprise .
but he saves from the sword of their mouth , even the needy from the hand of the mighty .
" behold , happy is the man whom God corrects . therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn 't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I toss and turn until the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust . my skin closes up , and breaks out afresh .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the anguish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
I loathe my life . I don 't want to live forever . leave me alone , for my days are but a breath .
if I have sinned , what do I do to you , you watcher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
" how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
God who is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who has hardened himself against him , and prospered ?
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
they have passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that swoops on the prey .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
you have clothed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together with bones and sinews .
if I am wicked , woe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction .
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
" but ask the animals , now , and they shall teach you ; the birds of the sky , and they shall tell you .
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach you . the fish of the sea shall declare to you .
he uncovers deep things out of darkness , and brings out to light the shadow of death .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also flees like a shadow , and doesn 't continue .
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
" should a wise man answer with vain knowledge , and fill himself with the east wind ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
he wanders abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
you have shriveled me up . this is a witness against me . my leanness rises up against me . it testifies to my face .
he has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . he has gnashed on me with his teeth . my adversary sharpens his eyes on me .
they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
his archers surround me . he splits my kidneys apart , and does not spare . he pours out my gall on the ground .
they change the night into day , saying ' The light is near ' in the presence of darkness .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he wanders into its mesh .
he has broken me down on every side , and I am gone . my hope he has plucked up like a tree .
those who dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger . I am an alien in their sight .
" have pity on me , have pity on me , you my friends ; for the hand of God has touched me .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
" because he knew no quietness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he delights .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
" how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sorrows in his anger ?
how often is it that they are as stubble before the wind , as chaff that the storm carries away ?
for you say , ' Where is the house of the prince ? where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? '
" can a man be profitable to God ? surely he who is wise is profitable to himself .
" isn 't God in the heights of heaven ? see the height of the stars , how high they are !
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he doesn 't see . he walks on the vault of the sky . '
yet he filled their houses with good things , but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
for then you will delight yourself in the Almighty , and shall lift up your face to God .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your vows .
when they cast down , you shall say , ' be lifted up . ' he will save the humble person .
he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
but he knows the way that I take . when he has tried me , I shall come forth like gold .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don 't know its ways , nor stay in its paths .
the eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight , saying , ' No eye shall see me . ' he disguises his face .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don 't know the light .
" they are foam on the surface of the waters . their portion is cursed in the earth . they don 't turn into the way of the vineyards .
how then can man be just with God ? or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ?
behold , these are but the outskirts of his ways . how small a whisper do we hear of him ! but the thunder of his power who can understand ? "
I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
" let my enemy be as the wicked . let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous .
I will teach you about the hand of God . that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
" this is the portion of a wicked man with God , the heritage of oppressors , which they receive from the Almighty .
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal . yes , the price of wisdom is above rubies .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
to man he said , ' Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom . to depart from evil is understanding . ' "
I was a father to the needy . the cause of him who I didn 't know , I searched out .
I chose out their way , and sat as chief . I lived as a king in the army , as one who comforts the mourners .
they are gaunt from lack and famine . they gnaw the dry ground , in the gloom of waste and desolation .
so that they dwell in frightful valleys , and in holes of the earth and of the rocks .
" now my soul is poured out within me . days of affliction have taken hold on me .
" I made a covenant with my eyes , how then should I look lustfully at a young woman ?
" if my heart has been enticed to a woman , and I have laid wait at my neighbor 's door ,
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
if I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or that the needy had no covering ;
" if I have made gold my hope , and have said to the fine gold , ' You are my confidence ; '
if the men of my tent have not said , ' Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? '
Oh that I had one to hear me ! ( behold , here is my signature , let the Almighty answer me ) ; let the accuser write my indictment !
let briars grow instead of wheat , and stinkweed instead of barley . " the words of Job are ended .
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .
for I don 't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
the Spirit of God has made me , and the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
" behold , I will answer you . in this you are not just , for God is greater than man .
" if there is beside him an angel , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to show to man what is right for him ;
he sings before men , and says , ' I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it didn 't profit me .
" behold , God works all these things , twice , yes three times , with a man ,
who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ?
shall even one who hates justice govern ? will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ? --
in a moment they die , even at midnight . the people are shaken and pass away . the mighty are taken away without a hand .
therefore he takes knowledge of their works . he overturns them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
if you have sinned , what effect do you have against him ? if your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky ? '
" bear with me a little , and I will show you ; for I still have something to say on God 's behalf .
he doesn 't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
but if they don 't listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .
Don 't let riches entice you to wrath , neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside .
who has prescribed his way for him ? or who can say , ' You have committed unrighteousness ? '
" listen to this , Job . stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God .
you whose clothing is warm , when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ?
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
have the gates of death been revealed to you ? or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
can you lead forth the constellations in their season ? or can you guide the Bear with her cubs ?
can you send forth lightnings , that they may go ? do they report to you , ' Here we are ? '
who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who has given understanding to the mind ?
can you number the months that they fulfill ? or do you know the time when they give birth ?
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don 't return again .
can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness ? or will he till the valleys after you ?
she deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
he eats up the ground with fierceness and rage , neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet .
as often as the trumpet sounds he snorts , ' Aha ! ' he smells the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
or do you have an arm like God ? can you thunder with a voice like him ?
behold , the hope of him is in vain . won 't one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
blessed is the man who doesn 't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ;
ask of me , and I will give the nations for your inheritance , the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession .
give sincere homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish in the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . blessed are all those who take refuge in him .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician , with the flutes . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Give ear to my words , Yahweh . consider my meditation .
but as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness , and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High .
for you have maintained my just cause . you sit on the throne judging righteously .
Yahweh has made himself known . he has executed judgment . the wicked is snared by the work of his own hands . meditation . Selah .
the wicked , in the pride of his face , has no room in his thoughts for God .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . by David . & gt ; & gt ; In Yahweh , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " Flee as a bird to your mountain ! "
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician ; upon an eight @-@ stringed lyre . a Psalm of David . & gt ; & gt ; Help , Yahweh ; for the godly man ceases . for the faithful fail from among the children of men .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; How long , Yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
from the wicked who oppress me , my deadly enemies , who surround me .
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; The heavens declare the glory of God . the expanse shows his handiwork .
more to be desired are they than gold , yes , than much fine gold ; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb .
keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . let them not have dominion over me . then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression .
save , Yahweh ! let the King answer us when we call !
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; The king rejoices in your strength , Yahweh ! how greatly he rejoices in your salvation !
I can count all of my bones . they look and stare at me .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing .
show me your ways , Yahweh . teach me your paths .
& lt ; & lt ; By David . & gt ; & gt ; Judge me , Yahweh , for I have walked in my integrity . I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering .
& lt ; & lt ; By David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
when evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh , even my adversaries and my foes , they stumbled and fell .
one thing I have asked of Yahweh , that I will seek after , that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life , to see Yahweh 's beauty , and to inquire in his temple .
give them according to their work , and according to the wickedness of their doings . give them according to the operation of their hands . bring back on them what they deserve .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm . a Song for the Dedication of the Temple . by David . & gt ; & gt ; I will extol you , Yahweh , for you have raised me up , and have not made my foes to rejoice over me .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
Oh how great is your goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
for this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him .
Don 't be like the horse , or like the mule , which have no understanding , who are controlled by bit and bridle , or else they will not come near to you .
& lt ; & lt ; By David . & gt ; & gt ; contend , Yahweh , with those who contend with me . fight against those who fight against me .
let them be as chaff before the wind , Yahweh 's angel driving them on .
let their way be dark and slippery , Yahweh 's angel pursuing them .
let destruction come on him unawares . let his net that he has hidden catch himself . let him fall into that destruction .
all my bones shall say , " Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? "
but in my adversity , they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together . the attackers gathered themselves together against me , and I didn 't know it . they tore at me , and didn 't cease .
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
for yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . yes , though you look for his place , he isn 't there .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . those who are cursed by him shall be cut off .
depart from evil , and do good . live securely forever .
Yahweh will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
as for transgressors , they shall be destroyed together . the future of the wicked shall be cut off .

& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a contemplation by the sons of Korah . & gt ; & gt ; As the deer pants for the water brooks , so my soul pants after you , God .
for they didn 't get the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them ; but your right hand , and your arm , and the light of your face , because you were favorable to them .
in your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth , humility , and righteousness . let your right hand display awesome deeds .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . according to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term . & gt ; & gt ; God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
he makes wars cease to the end of the earth . he breaks the bow , and shatters the spear . he burns the chariots in the fire .
" be still , and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations . I will be exalted in the earth . "
the princes of the peoples are gathered together , the people of the God of Abraham . for the shields of the earth belong to God . he is greatly exalted !
& lt ; & lt ; A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . & gt ; & gt ; Great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . & gt ; & gt ; Hear this , all you peoples . listen , all you inhabitants of the world ,
their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever , and their dwelling places to all generations . they name their lands after themselves .
wash me thoroughly from my iniquity . cleanse me from my sin .
against you , and you only , have I sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah .
every one of them has gone back . they have become filthy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
there they were in great fear , where no fear was , for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you . you have put them to shame , because God has rejected them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! when God brings back his people from captivity , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
with a free will offering , I will sacrifice to you . I will give thanks to your name , Yahweh , for it is good .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a contemplation by David . & gt ; & gt ; Listen to my prayer , God . Don 't hide yourself from my supplication .
for it was not an enemy who insulted me , then I could have endured it . neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me , then I would have hidden myself from him .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his covenant .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in anger cast down the peoples , God .
you number my wanderings . you put my tears into your bottle . aren 't they in your book ?
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
they have prepared a net for my steps . my soul is bowed down . they dig a pit before me . they fall into its midst themselves . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David . & gt ; & gt ; Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? do you judge blamelessly , you sons of men ?
but I will sing of your strength . yes , I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning . for you have been my high tower , a refuge in the day of my distress .
you have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthan . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; My soul rests in God alone . my salvation is from him .
surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . in the balances they will go up . they are together lighter than a breath .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my voice , God , in my complaint . preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . a song . & gt ; & gt ; Praise waits for you , God , in Zion . to you shall vows be performed .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
they also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders . you call the morning 's dawn and the evening with songs of joy .
the pastures are covered with flocks . the valleys also are clothed with grain . they shout for joy ! they also sing .
if I cherished sin in my heart , the Lord wouldn 't have listened .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . with stringed instruments . a Psalm . a song . & gt ; & gt ; May God be merciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Selah .
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy , for you will judge the peoples with equity , and govern the nations on earth . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . a song . & gt ; & gt ; Let God arise ! let his enemies be scattered ! let them who hate him also flee before him .
you , God , sent a plentiful rain . you confirmed your inheritance , when it was weary .
your congregation lived therein . you , God , prepared your goodness for the poor .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness .
the Lord said , " I will bring you again from Bashan , I will bring you again from the depths of the sea ;
rebuke the wild animal of the reeds , the multitude of the bulls , with the calves of the peoples . being humbled , may it bring bars of silver . scatter the nations that delight in war .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Lilies . " by David . & gt ; & gt ; Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck !
those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head . those who want to cut me off , being my enemies wrongfully , are mighty . I have to restore what I didn 't take away .
when I wept and I fasted , that was to my reproach .
when I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and don 't let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
& lt ; & lt ; By Solomon . & gt ; & gt ; God , give the king your justice ; your righteousness to the royal son .
he will judge the poor of the people . he will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces .
therefore pride is like a chain around their neck . violence covers them like a garment .
now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers .
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked , but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a Psalm by Asaph . a song . & gt ; & gt ; In Judah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .
there he broke the flaming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthun . a Psalm by Asaph . & gt ; & gt ; My cry goes to God ! indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . my hand was stretched out in the night , and didn 't get tired . my soul refused to be comforted .
& lt ; & lt ; A contemplation by Asaph . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
when he killed them , then they inquired after him . they returned and sought God earnestly .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
from following the ewes that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before you . according to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . by Asaph . & gt ; & gt ; Sing aloud to God , our strength ! make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob !
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
they don 't know , neither do they understand . they walk back and forth in darkness . all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
& lt ; & lt ; A song . a Psalm by Asaph . & gt ; & gt ; God , don 't keep silent . Don 't keep silent , and don 't be still , God .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . & gt ; & gt ; How lovely are your dwellings , Yahweh of Armies !
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , you have been favorable to your land . you have restored the fortunes of Jacob .
show us your loving kindness , Yahweh . grant us your salvation .
& lt ; & lt ; A Prayer by David . & gt ; & gt ; Hear , Yahweh , and answer me , for I am poor and needy .
teach me your way , Yahweh . I will walk in your truth . make my heart undivided to fear your name .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob .
& lt ; & lt ; A contemplation by Ethan , the Ezrahite . & gt ; & gt ; I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever . with my mouth , I will make known your faithfulness to all generations .
his seed will endure forever , his throne like the sun before me .
he who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty .
your statutes stand firm . Holiness adorns your house , Yahweh , forevermore .
unless Yahweh had been my help , my soul would have soon lived in silence .
make a joyful noise to Yahweh , all the earth ! burst out and sing for joy , yes , sing praises !
for my days consume away like smoke . my bones are burned as a torch .
but you , Yahweh , will remain forever ; your renown endures to all generations .
& lt ; & lt ; By David . & gt ; & gt ; Praise Yahweh , my soul ! all that is within me , praise his holy name !
but Yahweh 's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him , his righteousness to children 's children ;
to those who keep his covenant , to those who remember to obey his precepts .
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
& lt ; & lt ; A Song . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; My heart is steadfast , God . I will sing and I will make music with my soul .
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
let his days be few . let another take his office .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children .
he clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment . it came into his inward parts like water , like oil into his bones .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth .
Yahweh has sworn , and will not change his mind : " you are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . "
the wicked will see it , and be grieved . he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away . the desire of the wicked will perish .
Yahweh remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
& lt ; & lt ; A Song of ascents . & gt ; & gt ; In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . he answered me .
where the tribes go up , even Yah 's tribes , according to an ordinance for Israel , to give thanks to the name of Yahweh .
peace be within your walls , and prosperity within your palaces .
surely I have stilled and quieted my soul , like a weaned child with his mother , like a weaned child is my soul within me .
& lt ; & lt ; A Song of ascents . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , remember David and all his affliction ,
if your children will keep my covenant , my testimony that I will teach them , their children also will sit on your throne forevermore . "
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
& lt ; & lt ; A Song of ascents . & gt ; & gt ; Look ! praise Yahweh , all you servants of Yahweh , who stand by night in Yahweh 's house !
for there , those who led us captive asked us for songs . those who tormented us demanded songs of joy : " sing us one of the songs of Zion ! "
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Deliver me , Yahweh , from the evil man . preserve me from the violent man ;
the proud have hidden a snare for me , they have spread the cords of a net by the path . they have set traps for me . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , I have called on you . come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when I call to you .
& lt ; & lt ; A contemplation by David , when he was in the cave . a Prayer . & gt ; & gt ; I cry with my voice to Yahweh . with my voice , I ask Yahweh for mercy .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my prayer , Yahweh . listen to my petitions . in your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
I will sing a new song to you , God . on a ten @-@ stringed lyre , I will sing praises to you .
he has also established them forever and ever . he has made a decree which will not pass away .
he has lifted up the horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . praise Yah !
may the high praises of God be in their mouths , and a two @-@ edged sword in their hand ;
if they say , " Come with us , Let 's lay in wait for blood ; let 's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause ;
turn at my reproof . behold , I will pour out my spirit on you . I will make known my words to you .
because I have called , and you have refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no one has paid attention ;
but whoever listens to me will dwell securely , and will be at ease , without fear of harm . "
she is more precious than rubies . none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her .
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don 't say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
I have taught you in the way of wisdom . I have led you in straight paths .
for why should you , my son , be captivated with an adulteress ? why embrace the bosom of another ?
my son , if you have become collateral for your neighbor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger ;
to keep you from the immoral woman , from the flattery of the wayward wife 's tongue .
but if he is found , he shall restore seven times . he shall give all the wealth of his house .
therefore I came out to meet you , to diligently seek your face , and I have found you .
on the top of high places by the way , where the paths meet , she stands .
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness . there is nothing crooked or perverse in them .
for wisdom is better than rubies . all the things that may be desired can 't be compared to it .
the fear of Yahweh is to hate evil . I hate pride , arrogance , the evil way , and the perverse mouth .
while as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the beginning of the dust of the world .
" come , eat some of my bread , Drink some of the wine which I have mixed !
he who gathers in summer is a wise son , but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame .
blessings are on the head of the righteous , but violence covers the mouth of the wicked .
the labor of the righteous leads to life . the increase of the wicked leads to sin .
it is a fool 's pleasure to do wickedness , but wisdom is a man of understanding 's pleasure .
most certainly , the evil man will not be unpunished , but the seed of the righteous will be delivered .
he who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind . the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart .
the wicked are overthrown , and are no more , but the house of the righteous shall stand .
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes , but he who is wise listens to counsel .
every wise woman builds her house , but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands .
a scoffer seeks wisdom , and doesn 't find it , but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person .
the unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways ; likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways .
the poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor , but the rich person has many friends .
in the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress , and he will be a refuge for his children .
he who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker , but he who is kind to the needy honors him .
the way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh , but he loves him who follows after righteousness .
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes ; but Yahweh weighs the motives .
by mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for . by the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil .
when a man 's ways please Yahweh , he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him .
understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it , but the punishment of fools is their folly .
one who winks his eyes to plot perversities , one who compresses his lips , is bent on evil .
arrogant speech isn 't fitting for a fool , much less do lying lips fit a prince .
a bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it ; wherever he turns , he prospers .
many will entreat the favor of a ruler , and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts .
the king 's wrath is like the roaring of a lion , but his favor is like dew on the grass .
that which makes a man to be desired is his kindness . a poor man is better than a liar .
the sluggard buries his hand in the dish ; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
if you stop listening to instruction , my son , you will stray from the words of knowledge .
the terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion . he who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life .
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of understanding will draw it out .
even a child makes himself known by his doings , whether his work is pure , and whether it is right .
he who goes about as a tale @-@ bearer reveals secrets ; therefore don 't keep company with him who opens wide his lips .
a high look , and a proud heart , the lamp of the wicked , is sin .
the violence of the wicked will drive them away , because they refuse to do what is right .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than to share a house with a contentious woman .
there is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise ; but a foolish man swallows it up .
a wise man scales the city of the mighty , and brings down the strength of its confidence .
there are those who covet greedily all day long ; but the righteous give and don 't withhold .
a good name is more desirable than great riches , and loving favor is better than silver and gold .
a prudent man sees danger , and hides himself ; but the simple pass on , and suffer for it .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it .
drive out the mocker , and strife will go out ; yes , quarrels and insults will stop .
the mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit : he who is under Yahweh 's wrath will fall into it .
folly is bound up in the heart of a child : the rod of discipline drives it far from him .
Don 't you be one of those who strike hands , of those who are collateral for debts .
Don 't withhold correction from a child . if you punish him with the rod , he will not die .
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don 't feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
if you say , " Behold , we didn 't know this " ; doesn 't he who weighs the hearts consider it ? he who keeps your soul , doesn 't he know it ? shall he not render to every man according to his work ?
so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
for a righteous man falls seven times , and rises up again ; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity .
Don 't say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will render to the man according to his work . "
behold , it was all grown over with thorns . its surface was covered with nettles , and its stone wall was broken down .
for it is better that it be said to you , " Come up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince , whom your eyes have seen .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to those who send him ; for he refreshes the soul of his masters .
as one who takes away a garment in cold weather , or vinegar on soda , so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than to share a house with a contentious woman .
like snow in summer , and as rain in harvest , so honor is not fitting for a fool .
like a fluttering sparrow , like a darting swallow , so the undeserved curse doesn 't come to rest .
like one who grabs a dog 's ears is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own .
a stone is heavy , and sand is a burden ; but a fool 's provocation is heavier than both .
a full soul loathes a honeycomb ; but to a hungry soul , every bitter thing is sweet .
as a bird that wanders from her nest , so is a man who wanders from his home .
Don 't forsake your friend and your father 's friend . Don 't go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
those who forsake the law praise the wicked ; but those who keep the law contend with them .
whoever keeps the law is a wise son ; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father .
the rich man is wise in his own eyes ; but the poor who has understanding sees through him .
a tyrannical ruler lacks judgment . one who hates ill @-@ gotten gain will have long days .
one who works his land will have an abundance of food ; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty .
a faithful man is rich with blessings ; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished .
remove far from me falsehood and lies . give me neither poverty nor riches . feed me with the food that is needful for me ;
there is a generation whose teeth are like swords , and their jaws like knives , to devour the poor from the earth , and the needy from among men .
" the leach has two daughters : ' give , give . ' " there are three things that are never satisfied ; four that don 't say , ' Enough : '
" if you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself , or if you have thought evil , put your hand over your mouth .
for as the churning of milk brings forth butter , and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife . "
she rises also while it is yet night , gives food to her household , and portions for her servant girls .
she opens her arms to the poor ; yes , she extends her hands to the needy .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
is there a thing of which it may be said , " Behold , this is new ? " it has been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
that which is crooked can 't be made straight ; and that which is lacking can 't be counted .
I made myself gardens and parks , and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit .
I made myself pools of water , to water from it the forest where trees were reared .
for there is a man whose labor is with wisdom , with knowledge , and with skillfulness ; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it . this also is vanity and a great evil .
for what has a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , in which he labors under the sun ?
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set eternity in their hearts , yet so that man can 't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
that which is has been long ago , and that which is to be has been long ago : and God seeks again that which is passed away .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that wickedness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , that wickedness was there .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes downward to the earth ? "
then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him who is alone when he falls , and doesn 't have another to lift him up .
for out of prison he came forth to be king ; yes , even in his kingdom he was born poor .
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire . this also is vanity and a chasing after wind .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
sorrow is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don 't withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm , and his wise heart will know the time and procedure .
there is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit ; neither does he have power over the day of death . there is no discharge in war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those who practice it .
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are reverent before him .
then I commended mirth , because a man has no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be joyful : for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun .
for man also doesn 't know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .
then I said , " Wisdom is better than strength . " nevertheless the poor man 's wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand , but a fool 's heart at his left .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine makes the life glad ; and money is the answer for all things .
give a portion to seven , yes , even to eight ; for you don 't know what evil will be on the earth .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don 't withhold your hand ; for you don 't know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are darkened ,
further , because the Preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge . yes , he pondered , sought out , and set in order many proverbs .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart . behold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he glances through the lattice .
my beloved spoke , and said to me , " Rise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
the fig tree ripens her green figs . the vines are in blossom . they give forth their fragrance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " lover
my dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
catch for us the foxes , the little foxes that spoil the vineyards ; for our vineyards are in blossom . beloved
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all spices of the merchant ?
behold , it is Solomon 's carriage ! sixty mighty men are around it , of the mighty men of Israel .
they all handle the sword , and are expert in war . every man has his sword on his thigh , because of fear in the night .
go forth , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . lover
behold , you are beautiful , my love . behold , you are beautiful . your eyes are doves behind your veil . your hair is as a flock of goats , that descend from Mount Gilead .
your teeth are like a newly shorn flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . none is bereaved among them .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , to the hill of frankincense .
come with me from Lebanon , my bride , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of Amana , from the top of Senir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
your lips , my bride , drip like the honeycomb . honey and milk are under your tongue . the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
I have come into my garden , my sister , my bride . I have gathered my myrrh with my spice ; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey ; I have drunk my wine with my milk . friends Eat , friends ! drink , yes , drink abundantly , beloved . beloved
how is your beloved better than another beloved , you fairest among women ? how is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so adjure us ? beloved
my beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
I went down into the nut tree grove , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine budded , and the pomegranates were in flower .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires . friends
who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? under the apple tree I aroused you . there your mother conceived you . there she was in labor and bore you .
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
why should you be beaten more , that you revolt more and more ? the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it : wounds , welts , and open sores . they haven 't been closed , neither bandaged , neither soothed with oil .
the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard , like a hut in a field of melons , like a besieged city .
wash yourselves , make yourself clean . put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes . cease to do evil .
" come now , and let us reason together , " says Yahweh : " though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow . though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool .
your princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves . everyone loves bribes , and follows after rewards . they don 't judge the fatherless , neither does the cause of the widow come to them .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , the Mighty One of Israel , says : " Ah , I will get relief from my adversaries , and avenge myself of my enemies ;
the strong will be like tinder , and his work like a spark . they will both burn together , and no one will quench them . "
he will judge between the nations , and will decide concerning many peoples ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
in that day , men shall cast away their idols of silver , and their idols of gold , which have been made for themselves to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
for , behold , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support , the whole supply of bread , and the whole supply of water ;
the mighty man , the man of war , the judge , the prophet , the diviner , the elder ,
the captain of fifty , the honorable man , the counselor , the skilled craftsman , and the clever enchanter .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
in that day he will cry out , saying , " I will not be a healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing . you shall not make me ruler of the people . "
as for my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them . my people , those who lead you cause you to err , and destroy the way of your paths .
Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people , and their leaders : " it is you who have eaten up the vineyard . the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
in that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets , the headbands , the crescent necklaces ,
in that day , Yahweh 's branch will be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel .
Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion , and over her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night ; for over all the glory will be a canopy .
let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard . my beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill .
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
for the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and a Homer of seed shall yield an ephah . "
the harp , lyre , tambourine , and flute , with wine , are at their feasts ; but they don 't respect the work of Yahweh , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
he will lift up a banner to the nations from far , and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth . behold , they will come speedily and swiftly .
their roaring will be like a lioness . they will roar like young lions . yes , they shall roar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
one called to another , and said , " Holy , holy , holy , is Yahweh of Armies ! the whole earth is full of his glory ! "
then I said , " Woe is me ! for I am undone , because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for my eyes have seen the King , Yahweh of Armies ! "
then one of the seraphim flew to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
he touched my mouth with it , and said , " Behold , this has touched your lips ; and your iniquity is taken away , and your sin forgiven . "
I heard the Lord 's voice , saying , " Whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? " then I said , " Here I am . send me ! "
he said , " Go , and tell this people , ' You hear indeed , but don 't understand ; and you see indeed , but don 't perceive . '
make the heart of this people fat . make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn again , and be healed . "
it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is allied with Ephraim . " his heart trembled , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind .
then Yahweh said to Isaiah , " Go out now to meet Ahaz , you , and Shearjashub your son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool , on the highway of the fuller 's field .
tell him , ' Be careful , and keep calm . Don 't be afraid , neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches , for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
because Syria , Ephraim , and the son of Remaliah , have plotted evil against you , saying ,
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . if you will not believe , surely you shall not be established . ' "
he said , " Listen now , house of David . is it not enough for you to try the patience of men , that you will try the patience of my God also ?
Yahweh will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify : Uriah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah . "
it will sweep onward into Judah . it will overflow and pass through ; it will reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land , Immanuel .
" Don 't say , ' A conspiracy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A conspiracy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terrorized .
behold , I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies , who dwells in Mount Zion .
when they tell you , " Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards , who chirp and who mutter : " shouldn 't a people consult with their God ? should they consult the dead on behalf of the living ?
turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don 't speak according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
you have multiplied the nation . you have increased their joy . they rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest , as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his shoulders . his name will be called Wonderful , Counselor , Mighty God , Everlasting Father , Prince of Peace .
all the people will know , including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria , who say in pride and in arrogance of heart ,
the Syrians in front , and the Philistines behind ; and they will devour Israel with open mouth . for all this , his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spares his brother .
one will devour on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm :
Manasseh , Ephraim ; and Ephraim , Manasseh ; and they together shall be against Judah . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
they will only bow down under the prisoners , and will fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
however he doesn 't mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria , and the insolence of his haughty looks .
for he has said , " By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom ; for I have understanding : and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples , and have robbed their treasures . like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard bearer faints .
it will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , says " My people who dwell in Zion , don 't be afraid of the Assyrian , though he strike you with the rod , and lift up his staff against you , as Egypt did .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him , as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb . his rod will be over the sea , and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt .
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
behold , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will lop the boughs with terror . the tall will be cut down , and the lofty will be brought low .
his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
the nursing child will play near a cobra 's hole , and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper 's den .
they will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain ; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh , as the waters cover the sea .
the envy also of Ephraim will depart , and those who persecute Judah will be cut off . Ephraim won 't envy Judah , and Judah won 't persecute Ephraim .
there will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria , like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
in that day you will say , " Give thanks to Yahweh ! call on his name . declare his doings among the peoples . proclaim that his name is exalted !
I have commanded my consecrated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even Yahweh , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
wail ; for the day of Yahweh is at hand ! it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
behold , the day of Yahweh comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a desolation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible .
their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be ransacked , and their wives raped .
Babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldeans ' pride , will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
but wild animals of the desert will lie there , and their houses will be full of jackals . Ostriches will dwell there , and wild goats will frolic there .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh 's land for servants and for handmaids . they will take as captives those whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
they all will answer and ask you , " Have you also become as weak as we are ? have you become like us ? "
your pomp is brought down to Sheol , with the sound of your stringed instruments . maggots are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
you said in your heart , " I will ascend into heaven ! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
those who see you will stare at you . they will ponder you , saying , " Is this the man who made the earth to tremble , who shook kingdoms ;
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of evildoers will not be named forever .
" I will rise up against them , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and cut off from Babylon name and remnant , and son and son 's son , " says Yahweh .
this is the plan that is determined for the whole earth . this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations .
for Yahweh of Armies has planned , and who can stop it ? his hand is stretched out , and who can turn it back ? "
Don 't rejoice , O Philistia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the serpent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent .
the firstborn of the poor will eat , and the needy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remnant will be killed .
howl , gate ! cry , city ! you are melted away , Philistia , all of you ; for smoke comes out of the north , and there is no straggler in his ranks .
the burden of Moab : for in a night , Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to nothing ; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to nothing .
they have gone up to Bayith , and to Dibon , to the high places , to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba . baldness is on all of their heads . every beard is cut off .
for the waters of Dimon are full of blood ; for I will bring yet more on Dimon , a lion on those of Moab who escape , and on the remnant of the land .
give counsel ! execute justice ! make your shade like the night in the midst of the noonday ! hide the outcasts ! Don 't betray the fugitive !
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his boastings are nothing .
for the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jazer , which wandered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
it will happen that when Moab presents himself , when he wearies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
the burden of Damascus : " behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it will be a ruinous heap .
the fortress shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Yahweh of Armies .
it will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat , and his arm reaps the grain . yes , it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim .
yet gleanings will be left there , like the shaking of an olive tree , two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough , four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree , " says Yahweh , the God of Israel .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top , which were forsaken from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a desolation .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the uproar of many peoples , who roar like the roaring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebuke them , and they will flee far off , and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whirling dust before the storm .
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trumpet is blown , listen !
for Yahweh said to me , " I will be still , and I will see in my dwelling place , like clear heat in sunshine , like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest . "
the burden of Egypt : " behold , Yahweh rides on a swift cloud , and comes to Egypt . the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst .
I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians , and they will fight everyone against his brother , and everyone against his neighbor ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the charmers , those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards .
I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord . a fierce king will rule over them , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies , which he shakes over them .
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors , and he will send them a savior and a defender , and he will deliver them .
Yahweh will be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vow a vow to Yahweh , and will perform it .
at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz , saying , " Go , and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist , and take your shoes from off your feet . " he did so , walking naked and barefoot .
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea . as whirlwinds in the South sweep through , it comes from the wilderness , from an awesome land .
a grievous vision is declared to me . the treacherous man deals treacherously , and the destroyer destroys . go up , ELAM ; attack ! I have stopped all of Media 's sighing .
behold , here comes a troop of men , horsemen in pairs . " he answered , " Fallen , fallen is Babylon ; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground .
you are my threshing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
the burden of Dumah . one calls to me out of Seir , " Watchman , what of the night ? watchman , what of the night ? "
the watchman said , " The morning comes , and also the night . if you will inquire , inquire . come back again . "
the burden on Arabia . in the forest in Arabia you will lodge , you caravans of Dedanites .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
the burden of the valley of vision . what ails you now , that you have all gone up to the housetops ?
all your rulers fled away together . they were bound by the archers . all who were found by you were bound together . they fled far away .
therefore I said , " Look away from me . I will weep bitterly . Don 't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
it happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots , and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
in that day , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , called to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to dressing in sackcloth :
Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears , " Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
thus says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , " Go , get yourself to this treasurer , even to Shebna , who is over the house , and say ,
'What are you doing here ? who has you here , that you have dug out a tomb here ? ' cutting himself out a tomb on high , chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock ! "
he will surely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the chariots of your glory will be , you shame of your lord 's house .
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the pitchers .
" in that day , " says Yahweh of Armies , " the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way . it will be cut down , and fall . the burden that was on it will be cut off , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
the burden of Tyre . howl , you ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them .
on great waters , the seed of the Shihor , the harvest of the Nile , was her revenue . she was the market of nations .
be ashamed , Sidon ; for the sea has spoken , the stronghold of the sea , saying , " I have not travailed , nor brought forth , neither have I nourished young men , nor brought up virgins . "
who has planned this against Tyre , the giver of crowns , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth ?
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the kingdoms . Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan 's strongholds .
behold , the land of the Chaldeans . this people was not . the Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness . they set up their towers . they overthrew its palaces . they made it a ruin .
it will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king . after the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute .
take a harp ; go about the city , you prostitute that has been forgotten . make sweet melody . sing many songs , that you may be remembered .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
the earth also is polluted under its inhabitants , because they have transgressed the laws , violated the statutes , and broken the everlasting covenant .
therefore the curse has devoured the earth , and those who dwell therein are found guilty . therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
these shall lift up their voice . they will shout for the majesty of Yahweh . they cry aloud from the sea .
the earth will stagger like a drunken man , and will sway back and forth like a hammock . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
then the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed ; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion , and in Jerusalem ; and before his elders will be glory .
Yahweh , you are my God . I will exalt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faithfulness and truth .
for you have made a city into a heap , a fortified city into a ruin , a palace of strangers to be no city . it will never be built .
in this mountain , Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
he will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples , and the veil that is spread over all nations .
he has swallowed up death forever ! the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces . he will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth , for Yahweh has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " Behold , this is our God ! we have waited for him , and he will save us ! this is Yahweh ! we have waited for him . we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation ! "
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swims spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands .
in that day , this song will be sung in the land of Judah : " we have a strong city . God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully , and will not see Yahweh 's majesty .
Yahweh , your hand is lifted up , yet they don 't see ; but they will see your zeal for the people , and be disappointed . yes , fire will consume your adversaries .
the dead shall not live . the deceased shall not rise . therefore have you visited and destroyed them , and caused all memory of them to perish .
your dead shall live . my dead bodies shall arise . awake and sing , you who dwell in the dust ; for your dew is like the dew of herbs , and the earth will cast forth the dead .
for , behold , Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity . the earth also will disclose her blood , and will no longer cover her slain .
in that day , Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan , the fleeing serpent , and leviathan the twisted serpent ; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness . the calf will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
it will happen in that day , that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
behold , the Lord has a mighty and strong one . like a storm of hail , a destroying storm , and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing , he will cast them down to the earth with his hand .
to whom he said , " This is the resting place . give rest to weary " ; and " This is the refreshing " ; yet they would not hear .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , " Behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation . he who believes shall not act hastily .
your covenant with death shall be annulled , and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand . when the overflowing scourge passes through , then you will be trampled down by it .
for Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim . he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon ; that he may do his work , his unusual work , and bring to pass his act , his extraordinary act .
now therefore don 't be scoffers , lest your bonds be made strong ; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , on the whole earth .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
but the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all who fight against her and her stronghold , and who distress her , will be like a dream , a vision of the night .
isn 't it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
for the ruthless is brought to nothing , and the scoffer ceases , and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
" woe to the rebellious children , " says Yahweh , " who take counsel , but not from me ; and who make an alliance , but not with my Spirit , that they may add sin to sin ,
who tell the seers , " Don 't see ! " and to the prophets , " Don 't prophesy to us right things . tell us pleasant things . prophesy deceits .
but you said , " No , for we will flee on horses " ; therefore you will flee ; and , " We will ride on the swift " ; therefore those who pursue you will be swift .
therefore Yahweh will wait , that he may be gracious to you ; and therefore he will be exalted , that he may have mercy on you , for Yahweh is a God of justice . blessed are all those who wait for him .
for the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem . you will weep no more . he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
he will give the rain for your seed , with which you will sow the ground ; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful . in that day , your livestock will feed in large pastures .
behold , the name of Yahweh comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a devouring fire .
his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction ; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Yahweh will lay on him , will be with the sound of tambourines and harps . he will fight with them in battles , brandishing weapons .
for his burning place has long been ready . yes , for the king it is prepared . he has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood . Yahweh 's breath , like a stream of sulfur , kindles it .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when Yahweh stretches out his hand , both he who helps shall stumble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consumed together .
as birds hovering , so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem . he will protect and deliver it . he will pass over and preserve it . "
his rock will pass away by reason of terror , and his princes will be afraid of the banner , " says Yahweh , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
rise up , you women who are at ease ! hear my voice ! you careless daughters , give ear to my speech !
for the palace will be forsaken . the populous city will be deserted . the hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever , a delight for wild donkeys , a pasture of flocks ;
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high , and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field , and the fruitful field is considered a forest .
there will be stability in your times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge . the fear of Yahweh is your treasure .
the highways are desolate . the traveling man ceases . the covenant is broken . he has despised the cities . he doesn 't respect man .
hear , you who are far off , what I have done ; and , you who are near , acknowledge my might . "
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
your heart will meditate on the terror . where is he who counted ? where is he who weighed ? where is he who counted the towers ?
look at Zion , the city of our appointed festivals . your eyes will see Jerusalem , a quiet habitation , a tent that won 't be removed . its stakes will never be plucked up , nor will any of its cords be broken .
but there Yahweh will be with us in majesty , a place of broad rivers and streams , in which no galley with oars will go , neither will any gallant ship pass by there .
your rigging is untied . they couldn 't strengthen the foot of their mast . they couldn 't spread the sail . then the prey of a great spoil was divided . the lame took the prey .
come near , you nations , to hear ! listen , you peoples . let the earth and all it contains hear ; the world , and everything that comes from it .
their slain will also be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dissolved . the sky will be rolled up like a scroll , and all its armies will fade away , as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree .
for my sword has drunk its fill in the sky . behold , it will come down on Edom , and on the people of my curse , for judgment .
Yahweh 's sword is filled with blood . it is covered with fat , with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of rams ; for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah , And a great slaughter in the land of Edom .
thorns will come up in its palaces , nettles and thistles in its fortresses ; and it will be a habitation of jackals , a court for ostriches .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , hatch , and gather under her shade . yes , the kites will be gathered there , every one with her mate .
it will blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Carmel and Sharon . they will see Yahweh 's glory , the excellence of our God .
tell those who have a fearful heart , " Be strong . Don 't be afraid . behold , your God will come with vengeance , God 's retribution . he will come and save you .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
no lion will be there , nor will any ravenous animal go up on it . they will not be found there ; but the redeemed will walk there .
the Yahweh 's ransomed ones will return , and come with singing to Zion ; and everlasting joy will be on their heads . they will obtain gladness and joy , and sorrow and sighing will flee away . "
now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah , and captured them .
the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army . he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller 's field highway .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder came out to him .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Now tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised reed , even in Egypt , which if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand and pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
but if you tell me , ' We trust in Yahweh our God , ' isn 't that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away , and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem , ' You shall worship before this altar ? ' "
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it ? Yahweh said to me , " Go up against this land , and destroy it . " ' "
then Eliakim , Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh , " Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , for we understand it ; and don 't speak to us in the Jews ' language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you .
Don 't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us . this city won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . " '
Don 't listen to Hezekiah , for thus says the king of Assyria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and each of you eat from his vine , and each one from his fig tree , and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern ;
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , " Yahweh will deliver us . " have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth , and went into Yahweh 's house .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
Isaiah said to them , " Tell your master , ' Thus says Yahweh , " Don 't be afraid of the words that you have heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
behold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
" thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ' Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him . the virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt . "
have you not heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it in ancient times ? now I have brought it to pass , that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities , turning them into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants had little power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like a field before its crop has grown .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He will not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither will he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
in those days was Hezekiah sick and near death . Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
and said , " Remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
" go , and tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
I said , " In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol . I am deprived of the residue of my years . "
I said , " I won 't see Yah , Yah in the land of the living . I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul .
Lord , men live by these things ; and my spirit finds life in all of them : you restore me , and cause me to live .
behold , for peace I had great anguish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
for Sheol can 't praise you . death can 't celebrate you . those who go down into the pit can 't hope for your truth .
Hezekiah also had said , " What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Yahweh ? "
at that time , Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he heard that he had been sick , and had recovered .
then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah , and asked him , " What did these men say ? where did they come from to you ? " Hezekiah said , " They have come from a country far from me , even from Babylon . "
'Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Yahweh .
'They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " Yahweh 's word which you have spoken is good . " he said moreover , " For there will be peace and truth in my days . "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned , that she has received of Yahweh 's hand double for all her sins . "
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low . the uneven shall be made level , and the rough places a plain .
the glory of Yahweh shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it . "
the voice of one saying , " Cry ! " one said , " What shall I cry ? " " all flesh is like grass , and all its glory is like the flower of the field .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him .
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
he who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot . he seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard , yet ? haven 't you been told from the beginning ? haven 't you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
they are planted scarcely . they are sown scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wither , and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard ? the everlasting God , Yahweh , The Creator of the ends of the earth , doesn 't faint . he isn 't weary . his understanding is unsearchable .
but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eagles . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
" keep silent before me , islands , and let the peoples renew their strength . let them come near , then let them speak . let 's meet together for judgment .
he pursues them , and passes by safely , Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
the islands have seen , and fear . the ends of the earth tremble . they approach , and come .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth , and called from its corners , and said to you , ' You are my servant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
behold , all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
behold , I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth . you will thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and will make the hills like chaff .
you will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whirlwind will scatter them . you will rejoice in Yahweh . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
the poor and needy seek water , and there is none . their tongue fails for thirst . I , Yahweh , will answer them . I , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
that they may see , know , consider , and understand together , that the hand of Yahweh has done this , and the Holy One of Israel has created it .
produce your cause , " says Yahweh . " bring forth your strong reasons , " says the King of Jacob .
" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar , and as the potter treads clay .
he won 't break a bruised reed . he won 't quench a dimly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , until he has set justice in the earth , and the islands will wait for his law . "
" I , Yahweh , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
" I am Yahweh . that is my name . I will not give my glory to another , nor my praise to engraved images .
sing to Yahweh a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , you who go down to the sea , and all that is therein , the islands and their inhabitants .
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that Kedar inhabits . let the inhabitants of Sela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
who is blind , but my servant ? or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send ? who is as blind as he who is at peace , and as blind as Yahweh 's servant ?
but this is a robbed and plundered people . all of them are snared in holes , and they are hidden in prisons . they have become a prey , and no one delivers ; and a spoil , and no one says , ' Restore them ! '
who gave Jacob as plunder , and Israel to the robbers ? didn 't Yahweh , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , and they disobeyed his law .
but now thus says Yahweh who created you , Jacob , and he who formed you , Israel : " Don 't be afraid , for I have redeemed you . I have called you by your name . you are mine .
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and flame will not scorch you .
Don 't be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your seed from the east , and gather you from the west .
" you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " With my servant whom I have chosen ; that you may know and believe me , and understand that I am he . before me there was no God formed , neither will there be after me .
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " and I am God .
behold , I will do a new thing . it springs forth now . Don 't you know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wearied you with frankincense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wearied me with your iniquities .
this is what Yahweh who made you , and formed you from the womb , who will help you says : " Don 't be afraid , Jacob my servant ; and you , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water on him who is thirsty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
one will say , ' I am Yahweh 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jacob ; and another will write with his hand ' to Yahweh , ' and honor the name of Israel . "
who is like me ? who will call , and will declare it , and set it in order for me , since I established the ancient people ? let them declare the things that are coming , and that will happen .
Don 't fear , neither be afraid . haven 't I declared it to you long ago , and shown it ? you are my witnesses . is there a God besides me ? indeed , there is not . I don 't know any other Rock . "
behold , all his fellows will be disappointed ; and the workmen are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to shame together .
he burns part of it in the fire . with part of it , he eats meat . he roasts a roast , and is satisfied . yes , he warms himself , and says , " Aha ! I am warm . I have seen the fire . "
the rest of it he makes into a god , even his engraved image . he bows down to it and worships , and prays to it , and says , " Deliver me ; for you are my god ! "
they don 't know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can 't see ; and their hearts , that they can 't understand .
remember these things , Jacob and Israel ; for you are my servant . I have formed you . you are my servant . Israel , you will not be forgotten by me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , your transgressions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have redeemed you .
sing , you heavens , for Yahweh has done it ! shout , you lower parts of the earth ! break out into singing , you mountains , O forest , all of your trees , for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob , and will glorify himself in Israel .
who frustrates the signs of the liars , and makes diviners mad ; who turns wise men backward , and makes their knowledge foolish ;
who says to the deep , ' Be dry , ' and ' I will dry up your rivers ; '
who says of Cyrus , ' He is my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure , ' even saying of Jerusalem , ' She will be built ; ' and of the temple , ' Your foundation will be laid . ' "
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yahweh , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
I am Yahweh , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
I form the light , and create darkness . I make peace , and create calamity . I am Yahweh , who does all these things .
Distil , you heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness . let the earth open , that it may bring forth salvation , and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it . I , Yahweh , have created it .
woe to him who says to a father , ' What have you become the father of ? ' or to a mother , ' To what have you given birth ? ' "
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will make straight all his ways . he shall build my city , and he shall let my exiles go free , not for price nor reward , " says Yahweh of Armies .
they will be disappointed , yes , confounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
I have not spoken in secret , in a place of the land of darkness . I didn 't say to the seed of Jacob , ' Seek me in vain . ' I , Yahweh , speak righteousness . I declare things that are right .
" look to me , and be saved , all the ends of the earth ; for I am God , and there is no other .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves have gone into captivity .
and even to old age I am he , and even to gray hairs will I carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; yes , I will carry , and will deliver .
some pour out gold from the bag , and weigh silver in the balance . they hire a goldsmith , and he makes it a god . they fall down--yes , they worship .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ;
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed , I will also do it .
I bring near my righteousness , it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not wait ; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory .
" come down , and sit in the dust , virgin daughter of Babylon ; sit on the ground without a throne , daughter of the Chaldeans : for you shall no more be called tender and delicate .
take the millstones , and grind meal ; remove your veil , strip off the train , uncover the leg , pass through the rivers .
your nakedness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
" sit in silence , and go into darkness , daughter of the Chaldeans ; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
" now therefore hear this , you who are given to pleasures , who sit securely , who say in your heart , ' I am , and there is none else besides me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children : '
but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day , the loss of children , and widowhood ; in their full measure shall they come on you , in the multitude of your sorceries , and the great abundance of your enchantments .
" stand now with your enchantments , and with the multitude of your sorceries , in which you have labored from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prevail .
you are wearied in the multitude of your counsels : let now the astrologers , the Stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save you from the things that shall come on you .
behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : it shall not be a coal to warm at , nor a fire to sit before .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves on the God of Israel ; Yahweh of Armies is his name ) :
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .
yes , you didn 't hear ; yes , you didn 't know ; yes , from of old your ear was not opened : for I knew that you dealt very treacherously , and was called a transgressor from the womb .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be profaned ? I will not give my glory to another .
" listen to me , O Jacob , and Israel my called : I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
" assemble yourselves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
go forth from Babylon , flee from the Chaldeans ; with a voice of singing declare , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth : say , Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob .
they didn 't thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
and he said to me , " You are my servant ; Israel , in whom I will be glorified . "
but I said , " I have labored in vain , I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity ; yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh , and my reward with my God . "
now says Yahweh who formed me from the womb to be his servant , to bring Jacob again to him , and that Israel be gathered to him ( for I am honorable in the eyes of Yahweh , and my God has become my strength ) ;
thus says Yahweh , " In an acceptable time have I answered you , and in a day of salvation have I helped you ; and I will preserve you , and give you for a covenant of the people , to raise up the land , to make them inherit the desolate heritage :
saying to those who are bound , ' Come out ! ' ; to those who are in darkness , ' Show yourselves ! ' " they shall feed in the ways , and on all bare heights shall be their pasture .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
sing , heavens ; and be joyful , earth ; and break forth into singing , mountains : for Yahweh has comforted his people , and will have compassion on his afflicted .
" can a woman forget her nursing child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? yes , these may forget , yet I will not forget you !
kings shall be your nursing fathers , and their queens your nursing mothers : they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth , and lick the dust of your feet ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh ; and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed . "
but thus says Yahweh , " Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered ; for I will contend with him who contends with you , and I will save your children .
I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob . "
for the Lord Yahweh will help me ; therefore I have not been confounded : therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not be disappointed .
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yahweh , who obeys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yahweh , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Yahweh : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
for Yahweh has comforted Zion ; he has comforted all her waste places , and has made her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of Yahweh ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
" attend to me , my people ; and give ear to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
" listen to me , you who know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; don 't fear the reproach of men , neither be dismayed at their insults .
awake , awake , put on strength , arm of Yahweh ; awake , as in the days of old , the generations of ancient times . isn 't it you who cut Rahab in pieces , who pierced the monster ?
the ransomed of Yahweh shall return , and come with singing to Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads . they shall obtain gladness and joy . sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
" I , even I , am he who comforts you : who are you , that you are afraid of man who shall die , and of the son of man who shall be made as grass ;
I have put my words in your mouth , and have covered you in the shadow of my hand , that I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and tell Zion , ' You are my people . ' "
awake , awake , stand up , Jerusalem , that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath ; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering , and drained it .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
these two things have happened to you . who will bemoan you ? desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall I comfort you ?
thus says your Lord Yahweh , and your God who pleads the cause of his people , " Behold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering , even the bowl of the cup of my wrath ; you shall no more drink it again :
shake yourself from the dust ! arise , sit up , Jerusalem ! release yourself from the bonds of your neck , captive daughter of Zion !
the voice of your watchmen ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Yahweh returns to Zion .
depart , depart , go out from there , touch no unclean thing ! go out of the midst of her ! cleanse yourselves , you who bear the vessels of Yahweh .
for you shall not go out in haste , neither shall you go by flight : for Yahweh will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
but he was pierced for our transgressions . he was crushed for our iniquities . the punishment that brought our peace was on him ; and by his wounds we are healed .
all we like sheep have gone astray . everyone has turned to his own way ; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all .
he was oppressed , yet when he was afflicted he didn 't open his mouth . as a lamb that is led to the slaughter , and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute , so he didn 't open his mouth .
he was taken away by oppression and judgment ; and as for his generation , who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience of my people ?
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
" Don 't be afraid ; for you shall not be ashamed : neither be confounded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the shame of your youth ; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more .
for your Maker is your husband ; Yahweh of Armies is his name : and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer ; the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
" for a small moment have I forsaken you ; but with great mercies will I gather you .
in overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment ; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you , " says Yahweh your Redeemer .
" for this is like the waters of Noah to me ; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth , so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you , nor rebuke you .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my covenant of peace be removed , " says Yahweh who has mercy on you .
" you afflicted , tossed with storms , and not comforted , behold , I will set your stones in beautiful colors , and lay your foundations with sapphires .
in righteousness you shall be established : you shall be far from oppression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
" behold , I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals , and brings forth a weapon for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
why do you spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labor for that which doesn 't satisfy ? listen diligently to me , and eat you that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
behold , you shall call a nation that you don 't know ; and a nation that didn 't know you shall run to you , because of Yahweh your God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he has glorified you . "
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Yahweh , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
" for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth : it shall not return to me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do .
for you shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing ; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands .
thus says Yahweh , " Keep justice , and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
neither let the foreigner , who has joined himself to Yahweh , speak , saying , " Yahweh will surely separate me from his people " ; neither let the eunuch say , " Behold , I am a dry tree . "
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yahweh , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and holds fast my covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar ; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples . "
his watchmen are blind , they are all without knowledge ; they are all mute dogs , they can 't bark ; dreaming , lying down , loving to slumber .
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shepherds who can 't understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
" come , " say they , " I will get wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and tomorrow shall be as this day , great beyond measure . "
he enters into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one who walks in his uprightness .
on a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed ; there also you went up to offer sacrifice .
you were wearied with the length of your way ; yet you didn 't say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you weren 't faint .
for thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity , whose name is Holy : " I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart .
I have seen his ways , and will heal him : I will lead him also , and restore comforts to him and to his mourners .
yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways : as a nation that did righteousness , and didn 't forsake the ordinance of their God , they ask of me righteous judgments ; they delight to draw near to God .
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your healing shall spring forth speedily ; and your righteousness shall go before you ; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard .
then you shall call , and Yahweh will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , ' Here I am . ' " if you take away from the midst of you the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking wickedly ;
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obscurity be as the noonday ;
they hatch Adders ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he who eats of their eggs dies ; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we grope for the wall like the blind ; yes , we grope as those who have no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the twilight ; among those who are lusty we are as dead men .
for our transgressions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
for , behold , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the peoples ; but Yahweh will arise on you , and his glory shall be seen on you .
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your daughters shall be carried in the arms .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
the multitude of camels shall cover you , the dromedaries of Midian and ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come ; they shall bring gold and frankincense , and shall proclaim the praises of Yahweh .
surely the islands shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring your sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , for the name of Yahweh your God , and for the Holy One of Israel , because he has glorified you .
your gates also shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations , and their kings led captive .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
" for I , Yahweh , love justice , I hate robbery with iniquity ; and I will give them their recompense in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed . "
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a lamp that burns .
the nations shall see your righteousness , and all kings your glory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the mouth of Yahweh shall name .
for as a young man marries a virgin , so your sons shall marry you ; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride , so your God will rejoice over you .
Yahweh has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have labored :
but those who have garnered it shall eat it , and praise Yahweh ; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary . "
they shall call them The holy people , The redeemed of Yahweh : and you shall be called sought out , A city not forsaken .
who is this who comes from Edom , with dyed garments from Bozrah ? this who is glorious in his clothing , marching in the greatness of his strength ? " it is I who speak in righteousness , mighty to save . "
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bore them , and carried them all the days of old .
then he remembered the days of old , Moses and his people , saying , Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock ? where is he who put his holy Spirit in their midst ?
who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses ? who divided the waters before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
Oh that you would tear the heavens , that you would come down , that the mountains might quake at your presence ,
as when fire kindles the brushwood , and the fire causes the waters to boil ; to make your name known to your adversaries , that the nations may tremble at your presence !
you meet him who rejoices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sinned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?
there is none who calls on your name , who stirs up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consumed us by means of our iniquities .
" I am inquired of by those who didn 't ask ; I am found by those who didn 't seek me : I said , See me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
who sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat pig 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
who say , Stand by yourself , don 't come near to me , for I am holier than you . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burns all the day .
your own iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , " says Yahweh , " who have burned incense on the mountains , and blasphemed me on the hills ; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom . "
thus says Yahweh , " As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one says , ' Don 't destroy it , for a blessing is in it : ' so will I do for my servants ' sake , that I may not destroy them all .
I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen ; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you ; and he will call his servants by another name :
so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hidden from my eyes .
I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
they shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for calamity ; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh , and their offspring with them .
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Yahweh : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit , and who trembles at my word .
a voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies .
who has heard such a thing ? who has seen such things ? shall a land be born in one day ? shall a nation be brought forth at once ? for as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children .
shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? " says Yahweh : " shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb ? " says your God .
" rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for her , all you who love her : rejoice for joy with her , all you who mourn over her ;
for thus says Yahweh , " Behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream : and you will nurse . you will be carried on her side , and will be dandled on her knees .
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for , behold , Yahweh will come with fire , and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind ; to render his anger with fierceness , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
for by fire will Yahweh execute judgment , and by his sword , on all flesh ; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many .
" for I know their works and their thoughts : the time comes , that I will gather all nations and languages ; and they shall come , and shall see my glory .
it shall happen , that from one new moon to another , and from one Sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , " says Yahweh .
" they shall go forth , and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they will be loathsome to all mankind . "
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
" before I formed you in the belly , I knew you . before you came forth out of the womb , I sanctified you . I have appointed you a prophet to the nations . "
then I said , " Ah , Lord Yahweh ! behold , I don 't know how to speak ; for I am a child . "
but Yahweh said to me , " Don 't say , ' I am a child ; ' for to whoever I shall send you , you shall go , and whatever I shall command you , you shall speak .
behold , I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow , to build and to plant . "
the word of Yahweh came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a boiling caldron ; and it is tipping away from the north . "
for , behold , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , " says Yahweh ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Judah .
I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , in that they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
for , behold , I have made you this day a fortified city , and an iron pillar , and bronze walls , against the whole land , against the kings of Judah , against its princes , against its priests , and against the people of the land .
they will fight against you ; but they will not prevail against you ; for I am with you , " says Yahweh , " to deliver you . "
thus says Yahweh , " What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me , that they have gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
" for my people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
the young lions have roared at him , and yelled . they have made his land waste . his cities are burned up , without inhabitant .
now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shihor ? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria , to drink the waters of the River ?
" your own wickedness shall correct you , and your backsliding shall reprove you . know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter , that you have forsaken Yahweh your God , and that my fear is not in you , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
yet I had planted you a noble vine , wholly a right seed . how then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me ?
" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
" lift up your eyes to the bare heights , and see ! where have you not been lain with ? you have sat for them by the ways , as an Arabian in the wilderness . you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness .
therefore the showers have been withheld , and there has been no latter rain ; yet you have a prostitute 's forehead , you refused to be ashamed .
moreover , Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king , " Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done ? she has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree , and there has played the prostitute .
I saw , when , for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery , I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce , yet treacherous Judah , her sister , didn 't fear ; but she also went and played the prostitute .
yet for all this her treacherous sister , Judah , has not returned to me with her whole heart , but only in pretense , " says Yahweh .
only acknowledge your iniquity , that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God , and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree , and you have not obeyed my voice , ' says Yahweh . "
" return , backsliding children , " says Yahweh ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
" if you will return , Israel , " says Yahweh , " if you will return to me , and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight ; then you shall not be removed ;
and you shall swear , ' As Yahweh lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
for thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem , " Break up your fallow ground , and don 't sow among thorns .
circumcise yourselves to Yahweh , and take away the foreskins of your heart , you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem ; lest my wrath go forth like fire , and burn so that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
declare in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , ' Blow the trumpet in the land ! ' cry aloud and say , ' assemble yourselves ! let us go into the fortified cities ! '
set up a standard toward Zion . flee for safety ! Don 't wait ; for I will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction . "
a lion is gone up from his thicket , and a destroyer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land desolate , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabitant .
for this clothe yourself with sackcloth , lament and wail ; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn 't turned back from us .
at that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem , " A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people , not to winnow , nor to cleanse ;
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . woe to us ! for we are ruined .
as keepers of a field , they are against her all around , because she has been rebellious against me , ' " says Yahweh .
" your way and your doings have brought these things to you . this is your wickedness ; for it is bitter , for it reaches to your heart . "
my anguish , my anguish ! I am pained at my very heart ; my heart is disquieted in me ; I can 't hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
destruction on destruction is cried ; for the whole land is laid waste : suddenly are my tents destroyed , and my curtains in a moment .
" for my people are foolish , they don 't know me . they are foolish children , and they have no understanding . they are skillful in doing evil , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
I saw , and behold , there was no man , and all the birds of the sky had fled .
I saw , and behold , the fruitful field was a wilderness , and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh , before his fierce anger .
for thus says Yahweh , " The whole land shall be a desolation ; yet will I not make a full end .
for this the earth will mourn , and the heavens above be black ; because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and I have not repented , neither will I turn back from it . "
therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them , a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them , a leopard shall watch against their cities ; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces ; because their transgressions are many , and their backsliding is increased .
" how can I pardon you ? your children have forsaken me , and sworn by what are no gods . when I had fed them to the full , they committed adultery , and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes ' houses .
Shouldn 't I punish them for these things ? " says Yahweh ; " and shouldn 't my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
" go up on her walls , and destroy ; but don 't make a full end . take away her branches ; for they are not Yahweh 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , " says Yahweh .
behold , I will bring a nation on you from far , house of Israel , " says Yahweh . " it is a mighty nation . it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don 't know , neither understand what they say .
" but even in those days , " says Yahweh , " I will not make a full end with you .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Yahweh our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest . '
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit . therefore they have become great , and grew rich .
" shall I not punish for these things ? " says Yahweh . " shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
the prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests rule by their own authority ; and my people love to have it so . what will you do in the end of it ?
shepherds with their flocks shall come to her ; they shall pitch their tents against her all around ; they shall feed everyone in his place . "
for Yahweh of Armies said , " Cut down trees , and cast up a mound against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , " They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine . turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets . "
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they can 't listen . behold , the word of Yahweh has become a reproach to them . they have no delight in it .
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yahweh . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even to the priest , everyone deals falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of my people superficially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
thus says Yahweh , " Stand in the ways and see , and ask for the old paths , ' Where is the good way ? ' and walk in it , and you will find rest for your souls . but they said , ' We will not walk in it . '
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices pleasing to me . "
therefore thus says Yahweh , " Behold , I will lay stumbling blocks before this people . the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them . the neighbor and his friend shall perish . "
thus says Yahweh , " Behold , a people comes from the north country . a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
they take hold of bow and spear . they are cruel , and have no mercy . their voice roars like the sea , and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Zion . "
Don 't go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
" I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people ; that you may know and try their way .
Don 't trust in lying words , saying , Yahweh 's temple , Yahweh 's temple , Yahweh 's temple , are these .
if you don 't oppress the foreigner , the fatherless , and the widow , and don 't shed innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your own hurt :
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , from of old even forevermore .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yahweh .
but go now to my place which was in Shiloh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yahweh , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you didn 't hear ; and I called you , but you didn 't answer :
I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brothers , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
do they provoke me to anger ? says Yahweh . Don 't they provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
you shall tell them , This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of Yahweh their God , nor received instruction : truth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
cut off your hair , and throw it away , and take up a lamentation on the bare heights ; for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
for the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Yahweh : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
they have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I didn 't command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of Slaughter : for they shall bury in Topheth , until there is no place to bury .
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yahweh of Armies .
moreover you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh : shall men fall , and not rise up again ? shall one turn away , and not return ?
yes , the stork in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don 't know Yahweh 's law .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dismayed and taken : behold , they have rejected the word of Yahweh ; and what kind of wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives to others , and their fields to those who shall possess them : for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness ; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among those who fall ; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , says Yahweh .
I will utterly consume them , says Yahweh : no grapes shall be on the vine , nor figs on the fig tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them .
is there no balm in Gilead ? is there no physician there ? why then isn 't the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
they bend their tongue , as their bow , for falsehood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from evil to evil , and they don 't know me , says Yahweh .
they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit iniquity .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , Behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how should I deal with the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceit : one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
I will make Jerusalem heaps , a dwelling place of jackals ; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , Behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , Consider , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for the skillful women , that they may come :
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we ruined ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because they have cast down our dwellings .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our palaces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
speak , Thus says Yahweh , The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field , and as the handful after the harvester ; and none shall gather them .
thus says Yahweh , Don 't let the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , don 't let the rich man glory in his riches ;
but let him who glories glory in this , that he has understanding , and knows me , that I am Yahweh who exercises loving kindness , justice , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , says Yahweh .
Egypt , and Judah , and Edom , and the children of Ammon , and Moab , and all that have the corners of their hair cut off , who dwell in the wilderness ; for all the nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart .
they are like a palm tree , of turned work , and don 't speak : they must be carried , because they can 't go . Don 't be afraid of them ; for they can 't do evil , neither is it in them to do good . "
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it appertains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith ; blue and purple for their clothing ; they are all the work of skillful men .
but Yahweh is the true God ; he is the living God , and an everlasting King : at his wrath the earth trembles , and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation .
every man has become brutish and without knowledge ; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you , and on the families that don 't call on your name : for they have devoured Jacob , yes , they have devoured him and consumed him , and have laid waste his habitation .
and say to them , Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : cursed is the man who doesn 't hear the words of this covenant ,
that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as at this day . then answered I , and said , Amen , Yahweh .
Yahweh said to me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , Hear the words of this covenant , and do them .
yet they didn 't obey , nor turn their ear , but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart : therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant , which I commanded them to do , but they didn 't do them .
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus says Yahweh , Behold , I will bring evil on them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and they shall cry to me , but I will not listen to them .
then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing , even altars to burn incense to Baal .
what has my beloved to do in my house , since she has worked lewdness with many , and the holy flesh is passed from you ? when you do evil , then you rejoice .
Yahweh called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it , and its branches are broken .
for Yahweh of Armies , who planted you , has pronounced evil against you , because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who judges righteously , who tests the heart and the mind , I shall see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth , who seek your life , saying , You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh , that you not die by our hand ;
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , Behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
and there shall be no remnant to them : for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
you are righteous , Yahweh , when I contend with you ; yet I would reason the cause with you : why does the way of the wicked prosper ? why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously ?
you have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their mouth , and far from their heart .
if you have run with the footmen , and they have wearied you , then how can you contend with horses ? and though in a land of peace you are secure , yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan ?
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treacherously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don 't believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
they have sown wheat , and have reaped thorns ; they have put themselves to pain , and profit nothing : and you shall be ashamed of your fruits , because of the fierce anger of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors , who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit : behold , I will pluck them up from off their land , and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them .
it shall happen , if they will diligently learn the ways of my people , to swear by my name , As Yahweh lives ; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal ; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people .
but if they will not hear , then will I pluck up that nation , plucking up and destroying it , says Yahweh .
take the belt that you have bought , which is on your waist , and arise , go to the Euphrates , and hide it there in a cleft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Yahweh said to me , Arise , go to the Euphrates , and take the belt from there , which I commanded you to hide there .
therefore you shall speak to them this word : thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , Every bottle shall be filled with wine : and they shall tell you , Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ?
I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , says Yahweh : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have compassion , that I should not destroy them .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sorrows take hold of you , as of a woman in travail ?
I have seen your abominations , even your adulteries , and your neighing , the lewdness of your prostitution , on the hills in the field . woe to you , Jerusalem ! you will not be made clean ; how long shall it yet be ?
Judah mourns , and its gates languish , they sit in black on the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
their nobles send their little ones to the waters : they come to the cisterns , and find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are disappointed and confounded , and cover their heads .
yes , the hind also in the field calves , and forsakes her young , because there is no grass .
you hope of Israel , its Savior in the time of trouble , why should you be as a foreigner in the land , and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night ?
why should you be like a scared man , as a mighty man who can 't save ? yet you , Yahweh , are in the midst of us , and we are called by your name ; don 't leave us .
thus says Yahweh to this people , Even so have they loved to wander ; they have not refrained their feet : therefore Yahweh does not accept them ; now he will remember their iniquity , and visit their sins .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering , I will not accept them ; but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
you shall say this word to them , Let my eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous wound .
have you utterly rejected Judah ? has your soul loathed Zion ? why have you struck us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dismay !
do not abhor us , for your name 's sake ; do not disgrace the throne of your glory : remember , don 't break your covenant with us .
I will appoint over them four kinds , says Yahweh : the sword to kill , and the dogs to tear , and the birds of the sky , and the animals of the earth , to devour and to destroy .
I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh , the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
you have rejected me , says Yahweh , you have gone backward : therefore have I stretched out my hand against you , and destroyed you ; I am weary with repenting .
I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they didn 't return from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday : I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly .
she who has borne seven languishes ; she has given up the spirit ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day ; she has been disappointed and confounded : and their residue will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , says Yahweh .
Yahweh said , Most certainly I will strengthen you for good ; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don 't know ; for a fire is kindled in my anger , which shall burn on you .
I didn 't sit in the assembly of those who make merry , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with indignation .
I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall ; and they shall fight against you , but they shall not prevail against you ; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you , says Yahweh .
for thus says Yahweh , Don 't enter into the house of mourning , neither go to lament , neither bemoan them ; for I have taken away my peace from this people , says Yahweh , even loving kindness and tender mercies .
both great and small shall die in this land ; they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them ;
therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known , neither you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods day and night ; for I will show you no favor .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be said , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the countries where he had driven them . I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers .
behold , I will send for many fishermen , says Yahweh , and they shall fish them up ; and afterward I will send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the clefts of the rocks .
Yahweh , my strength , and my stronghold , and my refuge in the day of affliction , to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies , vanity and things in which there is no profit .
therefore behold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh .
my mountain in the field , I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil , and your high places , because of sin , throughout all your borders .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
I , Yahweh , search the mind , I try the heart , even to give every man according to his ways , according to the fruit of his doings .
a glorious throne , set on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
Yahweh , the hope of Israel , all who forsake you shall be disappointed . those who depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken Yahweh , the spring of living waters .
heal me , O Yahweh , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for you are my praise .
as for me , I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you ; neither have I desired the woeful day ; you know : that which came out of my lips was before your face .
let them be disappointed who persecute me , but let not me be disappointed ; let them be dismayed , but don 't let me be dismayed ; bring on them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
and tell them , Hear the word of Yahweh , you kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus says Yahweh , Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
but they didn 't listen , neither turn their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , and might not receive instruction .
it shall happen , if you diligently listen to me , says Yahweh , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but to make the Sabbath day holy , to do no work therein ;
then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and this city shall remain forever .
but if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy , and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day ; then will I kindle a fire in its gates , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be quenched .
arise , and go down to the potter 's house , and there I will cause you to hear my words .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the potter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
but they say , It is in vain ; for we will walk after our own devices , and we will do everyone after the stubbornness of his evil heart .
therefore thus says Yahweh : ask now among the nations , who has heard such things ; the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing .
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
yet , Yahweh , you know all their counsel against me to kill me ; don 't forgive their iniquity , neither blot out their sin from your sight ; but let them be overthrown before you ; deal you with them in the time of your anger .
thus said Yahweh , Go , and buy a potter 's earthen bottle , and take some of the elders of the people , and of the elders of the priests ;
and say , Hear the word of Yahweh , kings of Judah , and inhabitants of Jerusalem : thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , Behold , I will bring evil on this place , which whoever hears , his ears shall tingle .
because they have forsaken me , and have estranged this place , and have burned incense in it to other gods , that they didn 't know , they and their fathers and the kings of Judah ; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents ,
and have built the high places of Baal , to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal ; which I didn 't command , nor spoke it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that this place shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of Slaughter .
and shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : even so will I break this people and this city , as one breaks a potter 's vessel , that can 't be made whole again ; and they shall bury in Topheth , until there is no place to bury .
then came Jeremiah from Topheth , where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of Yahweh 's house , and said to all the people :
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .
you , Pashhur , and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity ; and you shall come to Babylon , and there you shall die , and there you shall be buried , you , and all your friends , to whom you have prophesied falsely .
Yahweh , you have persuaded me , and I was persuaded ; you are stronger than I , and have prevailed : I am become a laughing @-@ stock all the day , every one mocks me .
for as often as I speak , I cry out ; I cry , Violence and destruction ! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me , and a derision , all the day .
but Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail ; they shall be utterly disappointed , because they have not dealt wisely , even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
to this people you shall say , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I set before you the way of life and the way of death .
for I have set my face on this city for evil , and not for good , says Yahweh : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , says Yahweh ; and I will kindle a fire in her forest , and it shall devour all that is around her .
say , Hear the word of Yahweh , king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
thus says Yahweh : execute justice and righteousness , and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor : and do no wrong , do no violence , to the foreigner , the fatherless , nor the widow ; neither shed innocent blood in this place .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
I will prepare destroyers against you , everyone with his weapons ; and they shall cut down your choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
for thus says Yahweh touching Shallum the son of Josiah , king of Judah , who reigned instead of Josiah his father , and who went forth out of this place : he shall not return there any more .
but in the place where they have led him captive , there shall he die , and he shall see this land no more .
woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness , and his rooms by injustice ; who uses his neighbor 's service without wages , and doesn 't give him his hire ;
he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
inhabitant of Lebanon , who makes your nest in the cedars , how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you , the pain as of a woman in travail !
thus says Yahweh , Write you this man childless , a man who shall not prosper in his days ; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper , sitting on the throne of David , and ruling in Judah .
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will raise to David a righteous Branch , and he shall reign as king and deal wisely , and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that they shall no more say , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , As Yahweh lives , who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all the countries where I had driven them . they shall dwell in their own land .
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yahweh , and because of his holy words .
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourns ; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up . their course is evil , and their might is not right ;
therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil on them , even the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets : behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land .
for who has stood in the council of Yahweh , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
the anger of Yahweh shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask you , saying , What is the burden of Yahweh ? then you shall tell them , What burden ! I will cast you off , says Yahweh .
as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , who shall say , The burden of Yahweh , I will even punish that man and his house .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
one basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first @-@ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yahweh : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil ; to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
saying , Return now everyone from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers , from of old and even forevermore ;
and don 't go after other gods to serve them or worship them , and don 't provoke me to anger with the work of your hands ; and I will do you no harm .
it shall happen , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , says Yahweh , for their iniquity , and the land of the Chaldeans ; and I will make it desolate forever .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to me : take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at Yahweh 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yahweh had sent me :
Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and its kings , and its princes , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , a hissing , and a curse , as it is this day ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : drink , and be drunk , vomit , fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : you shall surely drink .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , Behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
wail , you shepherds , and cry ; and wallow in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goodly vessel .
he has left his covert , as the lion ; for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word from Yahweh , saying ,
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
it happened , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall surely die .
why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh , saying , This house shall be like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate , without inhabitant ? all the people were gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh .
then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy of death ; for he has prophesied against this city , as you have heard with your ears .
then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people , saying , Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard .
now therefore amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of Yahweh your God ; and Yahweh will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you .
only know for certain that , if you put me to death , you will bring innocent blood on yourselves , and on this city , and on its inhabitants ; for of a truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears .
then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets : this man is not worthy of death ; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God .
Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah ; and he spoke to all the people of Judah , saying , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : Zion shall be plowed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh , Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath jearim ; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Uriah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
and give them a command to their masters , saying , Thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , You shall tell your masters :
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
but as for you , don 't you listen to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreams , nor to your soothsayers , nor to your sorcerers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they prophesy a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should perish .
but the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him , that nation will I let remain in their own land , says Yahweh ; and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
Don 't listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they prophesy a lie to you .
for I have not sent them , says Yahweh , but they prophesy falsely in my name ; that I may drive you out , and that you may perish , you , and the prophets who prophesy to you .
Don 't listen to them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live : why should this city become a desolation ?
for thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city ,
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn 't take , when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem ;
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be , until the day that I visit them , says Yahweh ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azzur , the prophet , who was of Gibeon , spoke to me in the house of Yahweh , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , who went to Babylon , says Yahweh ; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears , and in the ears of all the people :
the prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and broke it .
Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people , saying , Thus says Yahweh : even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations . the prophet Jeremiah went his way .
go , and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus says Yahweh : you have broken the bars of wood ; but you have made in their place bars of iron .
then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah : Yahweh has not sent you ; but you make this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus says Yahweh , Behold , I will send you away from off the surface of the earth : this year you shall die , because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh .
now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity , and to the priests , to the prophets , and to all the people , whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon ,
( after that Jeconiah the king , the queen mother , the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the smiths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
take wives , and father sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there , and don 't be diminished .
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray to Yahweh for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : Don 't let your prophets who are in the midst of you , and your diviners , deceive you ; neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed .
thus says Yahweh of Armies ; Behold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that can 't be eaten , they are so bad .
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon , saying , Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ;
because they have worked folly in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbors ' wives , and have spoken words in my name falsely , which I didn 't command them ; and I am he who knows , and am witness , says Yahweh .
thus speaks Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , saying , Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : because Shemaiah has prophesied to you , and I didn 't send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
thus speaks Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book .
for thus says Yahweh : we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
ask now , and see whether a man does travail with child : why do I see every man with his hands on his waist , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
it shall come to pass in that day , says Yahweh of Armies , that I will break his yoke from off your neck , and will burst your bonds ; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant ;
for I am with you , says Yahweh , to save you : for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you , but I will not make a full end of you ; but I will correct you in measure , and will in no way leave you unpunished .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incurable : for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
for I will restore health to you , and I will heal you of your wounds , says Yahweh ; because they have called you an outcast , saying , It is Zion , whom no man seeks after .
their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from their midst ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me ? says Yahweh .
the fierce anger of Yahweh will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
at that time , says Yahweh , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry , Arise , and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God .
they shall come with weeping ; and with petitions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a straight way in which they shall not stumble ; for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : a voice is heard in Ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refuses to be comforted for her children , because they are no more .
thus says Yahweh : refrain your voice from weeping , and your eyes from tears ; for your work shall be rewarded , says Yahweh ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus , You have chastised me , and I was chastised , as an untrained calf : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yahweh my God .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities , when I shall bring again their captivity : Yahweh bless you , habitation of righteousness , mountain of holiness .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
but this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says Yahweh : I will put my law in their inward parts , and in their heart will I write it ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people :
thus says Yahweh , who gives the sun for a light by day , and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , who stirs up the sea , so that its waves roar ; Yahweh of Armies is his name :
thus says Yahweh : if heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner .
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , in the presence of Hanamel my uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase , before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : take these deeds , this deed of the purchase which is sealed , and this deed which is open , and put them in an earthen vessel ; that they may continue many days .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land .
Ah Lord Yahweh ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Yahweh of Armies is his name ;
great in counsel , and mighty in work ; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men , to give everyone according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
now therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence :
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hearts , that they may not depart from me .
call to me , and I will answer you , and will show you great things , and difficult , which you don 't know .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them ; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth .
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
thus says Yahweh : if you can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , so that there shall not be day and night in their season ;
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , Go , and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus says Yahweh , Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and you shall not escape out of his hand , but shall surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth , and you shall go to Babylon .
when the king of Babylon 's army was fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and against Azekah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities .
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
you had now turned , and had done that which is right in my eyes , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant , who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me , when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts ;
Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
behold , I will command , says Yahweh , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
go to the house of the Rechabites , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Yahweh , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
but it happened , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
take a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Josiah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh , in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan , the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh ,
then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
they said to him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears . so Baruch read it in their ears .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
so the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe . Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
it happened , when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier .
moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
the king commanded Jerahmeel the king 's son , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet ; but Yahweh hid them .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity ; and I will bring on them , and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and on the men of Judah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them , but they didn 't listen .
Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king , instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Yahweh , which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Pray now to Yahweh our God for us .
Pharaoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
it happened that , when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the guard was there , whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet , saying , You are falling away to the Chaldeans .
then Jeremiah said , It is false ; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans . but he didn 't listen to him ; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house , and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
then Zedekiah the king sent , and fetched him : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from Yahweh ? Jeremiah said , There is . he said also , You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
now please hear , my lord the king : please let my supplication be presented before you , that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
then Zedekiah the king commanded , and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard ; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city was spent . thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
thus says Yahweh , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
thus says Yahweh , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; and Jeremiah sank in the mire .
now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from here thirty men with you , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he dies .
so Ebedmelech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took there rags and worn @-@ out garments , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh : and the king said to Jeremiah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , If I declare it to you , will you not surely put me to death ? and if I give you counsel , you will not listen to me .
so Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah , saying , As Yahweh lives , who made us this soul , I will not put you to death , neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver you . obey , I beg you , the voice of Yahweh , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your soul shall live .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
it happened when Jerusalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and besieged it ;
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men , saying , Don 't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab , and among the children of Ammon , and in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
and they departed , and lived in Geruth Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
because of the Chaldeans ; for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land .
then all the captains of the forces , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even to the greatest , came near ,
and said to Jeremiah the prophet , Please let our supplication be presented before you , and pray for us to Yahweh your God , even for all this remnant ; for we are left but a few of many , as your eyes do see us :
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up ; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you .
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
I will grant you mercy , that he may have mercy on you , and cause you to return to your own land .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captive to Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Memphis , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : you have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem , and on all the cities of Judah ; and behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwells therein ,
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , to serve other gods , that they didn 't know , neither they , nor you , nor your fathers .
therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as it is this day .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will set my face against you for evil , even to cut off all Judah .
when we burned incense to the queen of the sky , and poured out drink offerings to her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings to her , without our husbands ?
moreover Jeremiah said to all the people , and to all the women , Hear the word of Yahweh , all Judah who are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
you shall tell him , Thus says Yahweh : behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pluck up ; and this in the whole land .
do you seek great things for yourself ? Don 't seek them ; for , behold , I will bring evil on all flesh , says Yahweh ; but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go .
Don 't let the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen .
Egypt rises up like the Nile , and his waters toss themselves like the rivers : and he says , I will rise up , I will cover the earth ; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Put , who handle the shield ; and the Ludim , who handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gilead , and take balm , virgin daughter of Egypt : in vain do you use many medicines ; there is no healing for you .
the word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
as I live , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies , surely like Tabor among the mountains , and like Carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
you daughter who dwells in Egypt , furnish yourself to go into captivity ; for Memphis shall become a desolation , and shall be burnt up , without inhabitant .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they didn 't stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their visitation .
the sound of it shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as wood cutters .
they shall cut down her forest , says Yahweh , though it can 't be searched ; because they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , says : behold , I will punish Amon of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with her gods , and her kings ; even Pharaoh , and those who trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall become an overflowing stream , and shall overflow the land and all that is therein , the city and those who dwell therein ; and the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his chariots , at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers don 't look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines , to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains : for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines , the remnant of the isle of Caphtor .
you sword of Yahweh , how long will it be before you be quiet ? put up yourself into your Scabbard ; rest , and be still .
how can you be quiet , since Yahweh has given you a command ? against Ashkelon , and against the seashore , there has he appointed it .
the praise of Moab is no more ; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her : come , and let us cut her off from being a nation . you also , madmen , shall be brought to silence : the sword shall pursue you .
the destroyer shall come on every city , and no city shall escape ; the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed ; as Yahweh has spoken .
give wings to Moab , that she may fly and get her away : and her cities shall become a desolation , without any to dwell therein .
Moab has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his lees , and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither has he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remains in him , and his scent is not changed .
Moab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .
all you who are around him , bemoan him , and all you who know his name ; say , How is the strong staff broken , the beautiful rod !
you daughter who dwells in Dibon , come down from your glory , and sit in thirst ; for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you , he has destroyed your strongholds .
Moab is disappointed ; for it is broken down : wail and cry ; tell it by the Arnon , that Moab is laid waste .
you inhabitants of Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock ; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss .
we have heard of the pride of Moab . he is very proud ; his loftiness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the haughtiness of his heart .
with more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you , vine of Sibmah : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of Jazer : on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen .
gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab ; and I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses : none shall tread with shouting ; the shouting shall be no shouting .
from the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh , even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even to Horonaim , to Eglath Shelishiyah : for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate .
on all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights , says Yahweh .
Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
he who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring on him , even on Moab , the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
wail , Heshbon , for Ai is laid waste ; cry , you daughters of Rabbah , clothe yourself in sackcloth : lament , and run back and forth among the fences ; for Malcam shall go into captivity , his priests and his princes together .
flee , turn back , dwell in the depths , inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him , the time that I shall visit him .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
for thus says Yahweh : behold , they to whom it didn 't pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished ? you shall not go unpunished , but you shall surely drink .
for I have sworn by myself , says Yahweh , that Bozrah shall become an astonishment , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes .

behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bozrah : and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
of Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad ; for they have heard evil news , they are melted away : there is sorrow on the sea ; it can 't be quiet .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh of Armies .
of Kedar , and of the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck . thus says Yahweh : arise , go up to Kedar , and destroy the children of the east .
their tents and their flocks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry to them , Terror on every side !
flee , wander far off , dwell in the depths , you inhabitants of Hazor , says Yahweh ; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you , and has conceived a purpose against you .
arise , go up to a nation that is at ease , that dwells without care , says Yahweh ; that have neither gates nor bars , that dwell alone .

the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning ELAM , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies : behold , I will break the bow of ELAM , the chief of their might .
on ELAM will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of ELAM shall not come .
I will cause ELAM to be dismayed before their enemies , and before those who seek their life ; and I will bring evil on them , even my fierce anger , says Yahweh ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them ;
the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon , concerning the land of the Chaldeans , by Jeremiah the prophet .
declare among the nations and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and don 't conceal : say , Babylon is taken , Bel is disappointed , Merodach is dismayed ; her images are disappointed , her idols are dismayed .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
in those days , and in that time , says Yahweh , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together ; they shall go on their way weeping , and shall seek Yahweh their God .
my people have been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who plunder my heritage , because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain , and neigh as strong horses ;
because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly desolate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hunted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first , the king of Assyria devoured him ; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
I will bring Israel again to his pasture , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead .
in those days , and in that time , says Yahweh , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Yahweh , and do according to all that I have commanded you .
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .
kill all her bulls ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe to them ! for their day has come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh .
behold , I am against you , you proud one , says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies ; for your day has come , the time that I will visit you .
the proud one shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all who are around him .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : the children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together ; and all who took them captive hold them fast ; they refuse to let them go .
their Redeemer is strong ; Yahweh of Armies is his name : he will thoroughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the earth , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a sword is on the Chaldeans , says Yahweh , and on the inhabitants of Babylon , and on her princes , and on her wise men .
a sword is on their horses , and on their chariots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of engraved images , and they are mad over idols .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
they lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax feeble : anguish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
at the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus says Yahweh : behold , I will raise up against Babylon , and against those who dwell in Lebkamai , a destroying wind .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall winnow her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
for Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah , of his God , of Yahweh of Armies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shields : Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Yahweh , the vengeance of his temple .
set up a standard against the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set the watchmen , prepare the ambushes ; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself , saying , Surely I will fill you with men , as with the canker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
behold , I am against you , destroying mountain , says Yahweh , which destroys all the earth ; and I will stretch out my hand on you , and roll you down from the rocks , and will make you a burnt mountain .
they shall not take of you a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but you shall be desolate for ever , says Yahweh .
set up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz : appoint a marshal against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Medes , its governors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their dominion .
one runner will run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter :
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will plead your cause , and take vengeance for you ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her fountain dry .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , says Yahweh .
how is Sheshach taken ! and the praise of the whole earth seized ! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
my people , go away from the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh .
Don 't let your heart faint , neither fear for the news that shall be heard in the land ; for news shall come one year , and after that in another year shall come news , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
then the heavens and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for joy over Babylon ; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north , says Yahweh .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach ; confusion has covered our faces : for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh 's house .
the sound of a cry from Babylon , and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans !
for Yahweh lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
for the destroyer has come on her , even on Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , their bows are broken in pieces ; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses , he will surely requite .
I will make drunk her princes and her wise men , her governors and her deputies , and her mighty men ; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake up , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the peoples shall labor for vanity , and the nations for the fire ; and they shall be weary .
the word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . now Seraiah was chief quartermaster .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
they took the two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh . the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
as for the pillars , the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits ; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it ; and its thickness was four fingers . it was hollow .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and pomegranates .
there were ninety @-@ six pomegranates on the sides ; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around .
the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ; she dwells among the nations , she finds no rest : all her persecutors overtook her within the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are desolate , her priests do sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me desolate and faint all the day .
for these things I weep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy has prevailed .
Zion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing .
Yahweh is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : please hear all you peoples , and see my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he has destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not ; Yes , her prophets find no vision from Yahweh .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your iniquity , to bring back your captivity , but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment .
all that pass by clap their hands at you . they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem , saying , Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty , The joy of the whole earth ?
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They hiss and gnash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried to the Lord : wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no respite ; don 't let the apple of your eye cease .
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not pitied .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
even the jackals draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
their appearance is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin clings to their bones ; it is withered , it has become like a stick .
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yahweh has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can 't touch their garments .
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky : they chased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished , daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry you away into captivity : he will visit your iniquity , daughter of Edom ; he will uncover your sins .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of Yahweh was there on him .
each one went straight forward : where the spirit was to go , they went ; they didn 't turn when they went .
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around .
when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up beside them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
under the expanse were their wings straight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
he said to me , Son of man , I send you to the children of Israel , to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me . they and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house ) , yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them .
you shall speak my words to them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear ; for they are most rebellious .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
for you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
as an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead : Don 't be afraid of them , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing , saying , Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
son of man , I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their iniquity .
again , when you have accomplished these , you shall lie on your right side , and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah : forty days , each day for a year , have I appointed it to you .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
you shall eat it as barley cakes , and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with fearfulness ; and they shall drink water by measure , and in dismay :
you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; You shall take it as a barber 's razor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard : then take balances to weigh , and divide the hair .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this is Jerusalem ; I have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are around her .
she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordinances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
thus shall my anger be accomplished , and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest , and I shall be comforted ; and they shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken in my zeal , when I have accomplished my wrath on them .
moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you , in the sight of all that pass by .
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment , to the nations that are around you , when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath , and in wrathful rebukes ; ( I , Yahweh , have spoken it ; )
when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
and I will send on you famine and evil animals , and they shall bereave you ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you ; and I will bring the sword on you : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : strike with your hand , and stamp with your foot , and say , Alas ! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel ; for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your abominations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , do strike .
the time has come , the day draws near : Don 't let the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is on all its multitude .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
they have blown the trumpet , and have made all ready ; but none goes to the battle ; for my wrath is on all its multitude .
the sword is outside , and the pestilence and the famine within : he who is in the field shall die with the sword : and he who is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them moaning , every one in his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
mischief shall come on mischief , and rumor shall be on rumor ; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
the king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothed with desolation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled : I will do to them after their way , and according to their own judgments will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me .
then I saw , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his waist and downward , fire ; and from his waist and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as it were glowing metal .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he said to me , Son of man , do you see what they do ? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here , that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but you shall again see yet other great abominations .
then he said to me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had dug in the wall , behold , a door .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of creeping things , and abominable animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , every man with his censer in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up .
then he said to me , Son of man , have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in his rooms of imagery ? for they say , Yahweh doesn 't see us ; Yahweh has forsaken the land .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women weeping for Tammuz .
then he said to me , Have you seen this , son of man ? you shall again see yet greater abominations than these .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clothed in linen , who had the writer 's inkhorn by his side .
Yahweh said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst .
he said to them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain . go forth ! they went forth , and struck in the city .
it happened , while they were smiting , and I was left , that I fell on my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord Yahweh ! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem ?
then he said to me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perversion : for they say , Yahweh has forsaken the land , and Yahweh doesn 't see .
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
it came to pass , when he commanded the man clothed in linen , saying , Take fire from between the whirling wheels , from between the cherubim , that he went in , and stood beside a wheel .
the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes all around , even the wheels that the four of them had .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me , and he said to me , Speak , Thus says Yahweh : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
you have multiplied your slain in this city , and you have filled its streets with the slain .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : your slain whom you have laid in its midst , they are the meat , and this is the caldron ; but you shall be brought out of its midst .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : whereas I have removed them far off among the nations , and whereas I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
then the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
the prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the dark , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , because he shall not see the land with his eyes .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
tell them therefore , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
for I am Yahweh ; I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall be performed ; it shall be no more deferred : for in your days , rebellious house , will I speak the word , and will perform it , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophesies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
they have seen falsehood and lying divination , who say , Yahweh says ; but Yahweh has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
tell those who plaster it with whitewash , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and you , great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger , and great hailstones in wrath to consume it .
so will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows , and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls ! will you hunt the souls of my people , and save souls alive for yourselves ?
you have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to kill the souls who should not die , and to save the souls alive who should not live , by your lying to my people who listen to lies .
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
son of man , these men have taken their idols into their heart , and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : return , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yahweh .
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they ravage it , and it be made desolate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : how much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the evil animals , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and animal !
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : as the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
I will set my face against them ; they shall go forth from the fire , but the fire shall devour them ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I set my face against them .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite ; the Amorite was your father , and your mother was a Hittite .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chaldea ; and yet you weren 't satisfied with this .
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your vaulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jewels ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
you are the daughter of your mother , who loathes her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children : your mother was a Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
before your wickedness was uncovered , as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria , and of all who are around her , the daughters of the Philistines , who do despite to you all around .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also deal with you as you have done , who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a great eagle with great wings and long feathers , full of feathers , which had various colors , came to Lebanon , and took the top of the cedar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers : and behold , this vine bent its roots toward him , and shot forth its branches toward him , from the beds of its plantation , that he might water it .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
say now to the rebellious house , Don 't you know what these things mean ? tell them , Behold , the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , and took its king , and its princes , and brought them to him to Babylon :
and he took of the seed royal , and made a covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his covenant it might stand .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose covenant he broke , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
for he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : as I live , surely my oath that he has despised , and my covenant that he has broken , I will even bring it on his own head .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword , and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , you shall not have [ occasion ] any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
has walked in my statutes , and has kept my ordinances , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , says the Lord Yahweh .
and who does not any of those [ duties ] , but even has eaten on the mountains , and defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
has wronged the poor and needy , has taken by robbery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the idols , has committed abomination ,
now , behold , if he fathers a son , who sees all his father 's sins , which he has done , and fears , and does not such like ;
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
yet you say , Why doesn 't the son bear the iniquity of the father ? when the son has done that which is lawful and right , and has kept all my statutes , and has done them , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Yahweh ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
yet you say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , house of Israel : is my way not equal ? aren 't your ways unequal ?
again , when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet the house of Israel says , " The way of the Lord is not fair . " house of Israel , aren 't my ways fair ? aren 't your ways unfair ?
therefore I will judge you , house of Israel , everyone according to his ways , says the Lord Yahweh . return , and turn yourselves from all your transgressions ; so iniquity shall not be your ruin .
cast away from you all your transgressions , in which you have transgressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
for I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies , says the Lord Yahweh : therefore turn yourselves , and live .
and say , What was your mother ? a lioness : she couched among lions , in the midst of the young lions she nourished her cubs .
she brought up one of her cubs : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
he knew their palaces , and laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and its fullness , because of the noise of his roaring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
your mother was like a vine , in your blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
but it was plucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit : its strong rods were broken off and withered ; the fire consumed them .
will you judge them , son of man , will you judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ;
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
I said to them , Cast away every man the abominations of his eyes , and don 't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Yahweh your God .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers ? and do you play the prostitute after their abominations ?
and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all , in that you say , We will be as the nations , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your doings , in which you have polluted yourselves ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South ;
son of man , set your face toward Jerusalem , and drop [ your word ] toward the sanctuaries , and prophesy against the land of Israel ;
and tell the land of Israel , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I am against you , and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus says Yahweh : say , A sword , a sword , it is sharpened , and also furbished ;
it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mirth ? the rod of my son , it condemns every tree .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
cry and wail , son of man ; for it is on my people , it is on all the princes of Israel : they are delivered over to the sword with my people ; strike therefore on your thigh .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stumblings be multiplied : Ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
you shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified .
while they see for you false visions , while they divine lies to you , to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded , whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall be for fuel to the fire ; your blood shall be in the midst of the land ; you shall be remembered no more : for I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
you , son of man , will you judge , will you judge the bloody city ? then cause her to know all her abominations .
those who are near , and those who are far from you , shall mock you , you infamous one full of tumult .
slanderous men have been in you to shed blood ; and in you they have eaten on the mountains : in the midst of you they have committed lewdness .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' nakedness ; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity .
in you have they taken bribes to shed blood ; you have taken interest and increase , and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression , and have forgotten me , says the Lord Yahweh .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and will do it .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have all become dross , therefore , behold , I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so you will be melted in its midst ; and you will know that I , Yahweh , have poured out my wrath on you .
son of man , tell her , You are a land that is not cleansed , nor rained on in the day of indignation .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
I sought for a man among them , who should build up the wall , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it ; but I found none .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them ; and on whoever she doted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
these uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a byword among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
dressed with girdles on their waists , with flowing turbans on their heads , all of them princes to look on , after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea , the land of their birth .
the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their prostitution , and she was polluted with them , and her soul was alienated from them .
she doted on their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth , in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , all the Assyrians with them ; desirable young men , governors and rulers all of them , princes and men of renown , all of them riding on horses .
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : you will drink of your sister 's cup , which is deep and large ; you will be ridiculed and held in derision ; it contains much .
you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of your sister Samaria .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
for when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and behold , thus have they done in the midst of my house .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a messenger was sent , and behold , they came ; for whom you did wash yourself , paint your eyes , and decorate yourself with ornaments ,
the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness ; and they put bracelets on their hands [ twain ] , and beautiful crowns on their heads .
they went in to her , as they go in to a prostitute : so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah , the lewd women .
righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .

utter a parable to the rebellious house , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh , Set on the caldron , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather its pieces into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : woe to the bloody city , to the caldron whose rust is therein , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she didn 't pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .

son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy , and tell them , even to the shepherds , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves ! Shouldn 't the shepherds feed the sheep ?
as a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad , so will I seek out my sheep ; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the watercourses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good pasture ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .

I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
I will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .

son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity .
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they profaned my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yahweh , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations , where they went .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I don 't do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my holy name , which you have profaned among the nations , where you went .
I will sanctify my great name , which has been profaned among the nations , which you have profaned in their midst ; and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , says the Lord Yahweh , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will save you from all your uncleanness : and I will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine on you .
I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
nor for your sake do I [ this ] , says the Lord Yahweh , be it known to you : be ashamed and confounded for your ways , house of Israel .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Yahweh , have built the ruined places , and planted that which was desolate : I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones : behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sinews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
then he said to me , Prophesy to the wind , prophesy , son of man , and tell the wind , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : come from the four winds , breath , and breathe on these slain , that they may live .
then he said to me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried up , and our hope is lost ; we are clean cut off .
therefore prophesy , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it and performed it , says Yahweh .
say to them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all ;
they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant , in which your fathers lived ; and they shall dwell therein , they , and their children , and their children 's children , forever : and David my servant shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them ; and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore .
son of man , set your face toward Gog , of the land of Magog , the prince of Rosh , Meshech , and tubal , and prophesy against him ,
and I will turn you around , and put hooks into your jaws , and I will bring you forth , with all your army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed in full armor , a great company with Buckler and shield , all of them handling swords ;
Gomer , and all his hordes ; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north , and all his hordes ; even many peoples with you .

you shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them riding on horses , a great company and a mighty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yahweh : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hordes , and on the many peoples who are with him , an overflowing shower , and great hailstones , fire , and sulfur .
I will magnify myself , and sanctify myself , and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
I will send a fire on Magog , and on those who dwell securely in the islands ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , the Holy One in Israel .
yes , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified , says the Lord Yahweh .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , says the Lord Yahweh .
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations .
they shall know that I am Yahweh their God , in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one reed broad ; and the other threshold , one reed broad .
every lodge was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @-@ five cubits ; door against door .
there were closed windows to the lodges , and to their posts within the gate all around , and likewise to the arches ; and windows were around inward ; and on [ each ] post were palm trees .
then brought he me into the outer court ; and behold , there were rooms and a pavement , made for the court all around : thirty rooms were on the pavement .
the pavement was by the side of the gates , answerable to the length of the gates , even the lower pavement .
the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured its length and its breadth .
the windows of it , and its arches , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arches were before them .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its arches were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
there was a gate to the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok , who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him .
then he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
the length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits ; even by the steps by which they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
then went he inward , and measured each post of the entrance , two cubits ; and the entrance , six cubits ; and the breadth of the entrance , seven cubits .
he measured its length , twenty cubits , and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said to me , This is the most holy place .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side room , four cubits , all around the house on every side .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cubits ; and the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
to [ the space ] above the door , even to the inner house , and outside , and by all the wall all around inside and outside , by measure .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits ' breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors were toward the north .
for they were in three stories , and they didn 't have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the uppermost ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
the wall that was outside by the side of the rooms , toward the outer court before the rooms , its length was fifty cubits .
for the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits : and behold , before the temple were one hundred cubits .
according to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one enters into them .
he measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed all around .
he measured it on the four sides : it had a wall around it , the length five hundred , and the breadth five hundred , to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
the upper altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns .
the altar hearth shall be twelve [ cubits ] long by twelve broad , square in the four sides of it .
the ledge shall be fourteen [ cubits ] long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and its bottom shall be a cubit around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
he said to me , Son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh : these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
you shall bring them near to Yahweh , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Yahweh .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
Yahweh said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
as for the prince , he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
you shall tell the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
you have not performed the duty of my holy things ; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having oversight at the gates of the house , and ministering in the house : they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister to them .
because they ministered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yahweh , and they shall bear their iniquity .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow who is the widow of a priest .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordinances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts ; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy .
of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty @-@ five thousand , and a breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary , which is most holy .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @-@ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
and one lamb of the flock , out of two hundred , from the well @-@ watered pastures of Israel--for a meal offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make atonement for them , says the Lord Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
in the first [ month ] , in the fourteenth day of the month , you shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering .
he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for a bull , and an ephah for a ram , and a Hin of oil to an ephah .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fifteenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : the gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah for a bull , and an ephah for a ram , and for the lambs as he is able to give , and a Hin of oil to an ephah .
you shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning , the sixth part of an ephah , and the third part of a Hin of oil , to moisten the fine flour ; a meal offering to Yahweh continually by a perpetual ordinance .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : if the prince give a gift to any of his sons , it is his inheritance , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
he said to me , This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , where they shall bake the meal offering ; that they not bring them forth into the outer court , to sanctify the people .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
in the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed , forty [ cubits ] long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ankles .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
but the miry places of it , and its marshes , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer Hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
the border from the sea , shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus ; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath . this is the north side .
the east side , between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead , and the land of Israel , shall be the Jordan ; from the [ north ] border to the east sea you shall measure . this is the east side .
the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh , to the brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side southward .
it shall happen , that in what tribe the stranger lives , there you shall give him his inheritance , says the Lord Yahweh .
by the border of Dan , from the east side to the west side , Asher , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Naphtali , from the east side to the west side , Manasseh , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Manasseh , from the east side to the west side , Ephraim , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Reuben , from the east side to the west side , Judah , one [ portion ] .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
it shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the Levites .
answerable to the border of the priests , the Levites shall have twenty @-@ five thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be twenty @-@ five thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
the five thousand that are left in the breadth , in front of the twenty @-@ five thousand , shall be for common use , for the city , for dwelling and for suburbs ; and the city shall be in its midst .
the city shall have suburbs : toward the north two hundred fifty , and toward the south two hundred fifty , and toward the east two hundred fifty , and toward the west two hundred fifty .
the remainder in the length , answerable to the holy offering , shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand westward ; and it shall be answerable to the holy offering ; and its increase shall be for food to those who labor in the city .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
this is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , says the Lord Yahweh .
it shall be eighteen thousand [ reeds ] around : and the name of the city from that day shall be , Yahweh is there .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
now among these were , of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king 's dainties , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah :
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of ten days their faces appeared fairer , and they were fatter in flesh , than all the youths who ate of the king 's dainties .
so the steward took away their dainties , and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language , O king , live forever : tell your servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if you don 't make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
I thank you , and praise you , you God of my fathers , who have given me wisdom and might , and have now made known to me what we desired of you ; for you have made known to us the king 's matter .
the king answered Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen , and its interpretation ?
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen hereafter ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face , and worshiped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
Daniel requested of the king , and he appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , over the affairs of the province of Babylon : but Daniel was in the gate of the king .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps , the deputies , and the governors , the judges , the treasurers , the counselors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
then the herald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , peoples , nations , and languages ,
that whenever you hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up ;
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
you , O king , have made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , shall fall down and worship the golden image ;
then Nebuchadnezzar in [ his ] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . then they brought these men before the king .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their Mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished , and rose up in haste : he spoke and said to his counselors , didn 't we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered the king , True , O king .
he answered , Look , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they are unharmed ; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods .
then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace : he spoke and said , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , you servants of the Most High God , come forth , and come here . then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation :
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dominion to the end of the earth .
therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable to you , and break off your sins by righteousness , and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor ; if there may be a lengthening of your tranquility .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
now I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise and extol and honor the King of heaven ; for all his works are truth , and his ways justice ; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase .
Belshazzar , while he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , might drink from them .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Are you that Daniel , who are of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Judah ?
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
now the wise men , the enchanters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
then Daniel answered before the king , Let your gifts be to yourself , and give your rewards to another ; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
you , king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty :
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
this is the interpretation of the thing : Mene ; God has numbered your kingdom , and brought it to an end ;
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which doesn 't alter .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , doesn 't respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
when he came near to the den to Daniel , he cried with a lamentable voice ; the king spoke and said to Daniel , Daniel , servant of the living God , is your God , whom you serve continually , able to deliver you from the lions ?
my God has sent his angel , and has shut the lions ' mouths , and they have not hurt me ; because as before him innocence was found in me ; and also before you , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
Daniel spoke and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea .
after this I saw , and behold , another , like a leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
as for the rest of the animals , their dominion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal , which was diverse from all of them , exceedingly terrible , whose teeth were of iron , and its nails of brass ; which devoured , broke in pieces , and stamped the residue with its feet ;
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
he shall speak words against the Most High , and shall wear out the saints of the Most High ; and he shall think to change the times and the law ; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time .
here is the end of the matter . as for me , Daniel , my thoughts much troubled me , and my face was changed in me : but I kept the matter in my heart .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the citadel of Susa , which is in the province of ELAM ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river Ulai .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
the male goat magnified himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
I heard a man 's voice between [ the banks of ] the Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
he said , Behold , I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation ; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end .
the ram which you saw , that had the two horns , they are the kings of Media and Persia .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
I , Daniel , fainted , and was sick certain days ; then I rose up , and did the king 's business : and I wondered at the vision , but none understood it .
in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus , of the seed of the Medes , who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans ,
in the first year of his reign I , Daniel , understood by the books the number of the years about which the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet , for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem , even seventy years .
I prayed to Yahweh my God , and made confession , and said , Oh , Lord , the great and dreadful God , who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
he has confirmed his words , which he spoke against us , and against our judges who judged us , by bringing on us a great evil ; for under the whole sky , such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil has come on us : yet have we not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God , that we should turn from our iniquities , and have discernment in your truth .
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his petitions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
at the beginning of your petitions the commandment went forth , and I have come to tell you ; for you are greatly beloved : therefore consider the matter , and understand the vision .
in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel , whose name was called Belteshazzar ; and the thing was true , even a great warfare : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
also their gods , with their molten images , with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry captive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
as for both these kings , their hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries .
he shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him ; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many .
he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
one said to the man clothed in linen , who was above the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
many shall purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
but go you your way until the end ; for you shall rest , and shall stand in your lot , at the end of the days .
the word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
when Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea , Yahweh said to Hosea , " Go , take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness ; for the land commits great adultery , forsaking Yahweh . "
Yahweh said to him , " Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
it will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . "
but I will have mercy on the house of Judah , and will save them by Yahweh their God , and will not save them by bow , sword , battle , horses , or horsemen . "
the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of Jezreel .
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
indeed , on her children I will have no mercy ; for they are children of unfaithfulness ;
for their mother has played the prostitute . she who conceived them has done shamefully ; for she said , ' I will go after my lovers , who give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , my oil and my drink . '
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thorns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can 't find her way .
she will follow after her lovers , but she won 't overtake them ; and she will seek them , but won 't find them . then she will say , ' I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now . '
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
I will visit on her the days of the Baals , to which she burned incense , when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , " says Yahweh .
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will betroth you to me forever . yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
Yahweh said to me , " Go again , love a woman loved by another , and an adulteress , even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel , though they turn to other gods , and love cakes of raisins . "
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the prostitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ephod or idols .
afterward the children of Israel shall return , and seek Yahweh their God , and David their king , and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days .
hear the word of Yahweh , you children of Israel ; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . because you have rejected knowledge , I will also reject you , that you may be no priest to me . because you have forgotten your God 's law , I will also forget your children .
they sacrifice on the tops of the mountains , and burn incense on the hills , under oaks and poplars and terebinths , because its shade is good . therefore your daughters play the prostitute , and your brides commit adultery .
" listen to this , you priests ! listen , house of Israel , and give ear , house of the king ! for the judgment is against you ; for you have been a snare at Mizpah , and a net spread on Tabor .
I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hidden from me ; for now , Ephraim , you have played the prostitute . Israel is defiled .
their deeds won 't allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don 't know Yahweh .
they will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh ; but they won 't find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
the princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark . I will pour out my wrath on them like water .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
" Ephraim , what shall I do to you ? Judah , what shall I do to you ? for your love is like a morning cloud , and like the dew that disappears early .
in the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing . there is prostitution in Ephraim . Israel is defiled .
when I would heal Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered , also the wickedness of Samaria ; for they commit falsehood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of robbers ravages outside .
they are all adulterers . they are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring , from the kneading of the dough , until it is leavened .
for they have prepared their heart like an oven , while they lie in wait . their baker sleeps all the night . in the morning it burns as a flaming fire .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them , as their congregation has heard .
woe to them ! for they have wandered from me . destruction to them ! for they have trespassed against me . though I would redeem them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they return , but not to the Most High . they are like a faulty bow . their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue . this will be their derision in the land of Egypt .
" put the trumpet to your lips ! something like an eagle is over Yahweh 's house , because they have broken my covenant , and rebelled against my law .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made princes , and I didn 't approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols , that they may be cut off .
let Samaria throw out his calf idol ! my anger burns against them ! how long will it be until they are capable of purity ?
for this is even from Israel ! the workman made it , and it is no God ; indeed , the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
as for the sacrifices of my offerings , they sacrifice flesh and eat it ; But Yahweh doesn 't accept them . now he will remember their iniquity , and punish their sins . they will return to Egypt .
for Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces ; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities ; but I will send a fire on his cities , and it will devour its fortresses . "
they won 't dwell in Yahweh 's land ; but Ephraim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
for , behold , they have gone away from destruction . Egypt will gather them up . Memphis will bury them . nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver . thorns will be in their tents .
a prophet watches over Ephraim with my God . a Fowler 's snare is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
Ephraim is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
my God will cast them away , because they did not listen to him ; and they will be wanderers among the nations .
surely now they will say , " We have no king ; for we don 't fear Yahweh ; and the king , what can he do for us ? "
it also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king . Ephraim will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
the high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , will be destroyed . the thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars . they will tell the mountains , " Cover us ! " and the hills , " Fall on us ! "
when it is my desire , I will chastise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh ; so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck . I will set a rider on Ephraim . Judah will plow . Jacob will break his clods .
you have plowed wickedness . you have reaped iniquity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle roar will arise among your people , and all your fortresses will be destroyed , as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle . the mother was dashed in pieces with her children .
they called to them , so they went from them . they sacrificed to the Baals , and burned incense to engraved images .
the sword will fall on their cities , and will destroy the bars of their gates , and will put an end to their plans .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yahweh .
Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood , and the house of Israel with deceit . Judah still strays from God , and is unfaithful to the Holy One .
indeed , he struggled with the angel , and prevailed ; he wept , and made supplication to him . he found him at Bethel , and there he spoke with us ,
" but I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
Jacob fled into the country of Aram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended flocks and herds .
I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will devour them like a lioness . the wild animal will tear them .
I will ransom them from the power of Sheol . I will redeem them from death ! death , where are your plagues ? Sheol , where is your destruction ? " compassion will be hidden from my eyes .
Samaria will bear her guilt ; for she has rebelled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . "
who is wise , that he may understand these things ? who is prudent , that he may know them ? for the ways of Yahweh are right , and the righteous walk in them ; But the rebellious stumble in them .
hear this , you elders , And listen , all you inhabitants of the land . has this ever happened in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
wake up , you drunkards , and weep ! wail , all you drinkers of wine , because of the sweet wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the fangs of a lioness .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fig tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
be confounded , you farmers ! wail , you vineyard keepers ; for the wheat and for the barley ; for the harvest of the field has perished .
sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yahweh , your God , and cry to Yahweh .
the seeds rot under their clods . the granaries are laid desolate . the barns are broken down , for the grain has withered .
how the animals groan ! the herds of livestock are perplexed , because they have no pasture . yes , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
Yahweh , I cry to you , For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water brooks have dried up , And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tremble , for the day of Yahweh comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire devours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a desolate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
their appearance is as the appearance of horses , and as horsemen , so do they run .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
neither does one jostle another ; they march everyone in his path , and they burst through the defenses , and don 't break ranks .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
the earth quakes before them . the heavens tremble . the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
tear your heart , and not your garments , and turn to Yahweh , your God ; for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness , and relents from sending calamity .
who knows ? he may turn and Relent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh , your God .
gather the people . sanctify the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bridegroom go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
" be glad then , you children of Zion , and rejoice in Yahweh , your God ; for he gives you the former rain in just measure , and he causes the rain to come down for you , the former rain and the latter rain , as before .
I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten , the great locust , the grasshopper , and the caterpillar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yahweh , your God , who has dealt wondrously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Yahweh , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen afterward , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . your old men will dream dreams . your young men will see visions .
it will happen that whoever will call on the name of Yahweh shall be saved ; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape , as Yahweh has said , and among the remnant , those whom Yahweh calls .
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat ; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
" yes , and what are you to me , Tyre , and Sidon , and all the regions of Philistia ? will you repay me ? and if you repay me , I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head .
proclaim this among the nations : " prepare for war ! stir up the mighty men . let all the warriors draw near . let them come up .
hurry and come , all you surrounding nations , and gather yourselves together . " cause your mighty ones to come down there , Yahweh .
" let the nations arouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
put in the sickle ; for the harvest is ripe . come , tread , for the winepress is full , the vats overflow , for their wickedness is great . "
Yahweh will roar from Zion , and thunder from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth will shake ; but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people , and a stronghold to the children of Israel .
Egypt will be a desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
the words of Amos , who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa , which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel , two years before the earthquake .
he said : " Yahweh will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn , and the top of Carmel will wither . "
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to Edom ;
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , and it will devour its palaces .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Tyre , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to Edom , and didn 't remember the brotherly covenant ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Edom , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he pursued his brother with the sword , and cast off all pity , and his anger raged continually , and he kept his wrath forever ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Moab , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime ;
and I will cut off the judge from their midst , and will kill all its princes with him , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
they trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same maiden , to profane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
yet I destroyed the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
I raised up some of your sons for prophets , and some of your young men for Nazirites . isn 't this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yahweh .
" but you gave the Nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , ' Don 't prophesy ! '
behold , I will crush you in your place , as a cart crushes that is full of grain .
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won 't escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day , " says Yahweh .
" you only have I chosen of all the families of the earth . therefore I will punish you for all of your sins . "
proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , " assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria , and see what unrest is in her , and what oppression is among them . "
" indeed they don 't know to do right , " says Yahweh , " Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces . "
" for in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
listen to this word , you cows of Bashan , who are on the mountain of Samaria , who oppress the poor , who crush the needy , who tell their husbands , " Bring us drinks ! "
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone straight before her ; and you will cast yourselves into Harmon , " says Yahweh .
offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened , and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them : for this pleases you , you children of Israel , " says the Lord Yahweh .
for , behold , he who forms the mountains , and creates the wind , and declares to man what is his thought ; who makes the morning darkness , and treads on the high places of the earth : Yahweh , the God of Armies , is his name . "
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : " the city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left , and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel . "
but don 't seek Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal , and don 't pass to Beersheba : for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and Bethel shall come to nothing .
for I know how many your offenses , and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the needy in the courts .

in all vineyards there will be wailing ; for I will pass through the midst of you , " says Yahweh .
yes , though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals .
you also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images , the star of your god , which you made for yourselves .
therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , " says Yahweh , whose name is the God of Armies .
go to Calneh , and see ; and from there go to Hamath the great ; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. are they better than these kingdoms ? or is their border greater than your border ?
those who put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
who lie on beds of ivory , and stretch themselves on their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive ; and the feasting and lounging will end .
" the Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself , " says Yahweh , the God of Armies : " I abhor the pride of Jacob , and detest his fortresses . therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it .
" for , behold , Yahweh commands , and the great house will be smashed to pieces , and the little house into bits .
do horses run on the rocky crags ? does one plow there with oxen ? but you have turned justice into poison , and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness ;
you who rejoice in a thing of nothing , who say , ' Haven 't we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength ? '
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me : and behold , he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and behold , it was the latter growth after the king 's harvest .
then I said , " Lord Yahweh , stop , I beg you ! how could Jacob stand ? for he is small . "
thus he showed me and behold , the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line , with a plumb line in his hand .
then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , " Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel . the land is not able to bear all his words .
Amaziah also said to Amos , " You seer , go , flee away into the land of Judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
then Amos answered Amaziah , " I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was a herdsman , and a farmer of sycamore figs ;
now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh : ' you say , Don 't prophesy against Israel , and don 't preach against the house of Isaac . '
he said , " Amos , what do you see ? " I said , " A basket of summer fruit . " then Yahweh said to me , " The end has come on my people Israel . I will not again pass by them any more .
won 't the land tremble for this , and everyone mourn who dwells in it ? yes , it will rise up wholly like the River ; and it will be stirred up and sink again , like the River of Egypt .

though they go into captivity before their enemies , there I will command the sword , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for evil , and not for good .
for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , is he who touches the land and it melts , and all who dwell in it will mourn ; and it will rise up wholly like the River , and will sink again , like the River of Egypt .
are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me , children of Israel ? " says Yahweh . " haven 't I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt , and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
I will bring my people Israel back from captivity , and they will rebuild the ruined cities , and inhabit them ; and they will plant vineyards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gardens , and eat their fruit .
the vision of Obadiah . this is what the Lord Yahweh says about Edom . we have heard news from Yahweh , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , " Arise , and let 's rise up against her in battle .
the pride of your heart has deceived you , you who dwell in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high , who says in his heart , ' Who will bring me down to the ground ? '
" won 't I in that day , " says Yahweh , " destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mountain of Esau ?
for the violence done to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will be cut off forever .
Don 't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don 't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .
for the day of Yahweh is near all the nations ! as you have done , it will be done to you . your deeds will return upon your own head .
for as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink continually . yes , they will drink , swallow down , and will be as though they had not been .
but in Mount Zion , there will be those who escape , and it will be holy . the house of Jacob will possess their possessions .
the house of Jacob will be a fire , the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble . they will burn among them , and devour them . there will not be any remaining to the house of Esau . " indeed , Yahweh has spoken .
those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau , and those of the lowland , the Philistines . they will possess the field of Ephraim , and the field of Samaria . Benjamin will possess Gilead .
but Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh . he went down to Joppa , and found a ship going to Tarshish ; so he paid its fare , and went down into it , to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh .
but Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
then the mariners were afraid , and every man cried to his god . they threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten the ship . but Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship , and he was laying down , and was fast asleep .
so the shipmaster came to him , and said to him , " What do you mean , sleeper ? arise , call on your God ! maybe your God will notice us , so that we won 't perish . "
they all said to each other , " Come , let us cast lots , that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us . " so they cast lots , and the lot fell on Jonah .
then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said to him , " What is this that you have done ? " for the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh , because he had told them .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stormy .
he said to them , " Take me up , and throw me into the sea . then the sea will be calm for you ; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you . "
but let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mightily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
then Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth , and sat under it in the shade , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yahweh God prepared a vine , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his discomfort . so Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine .
it happened , when the sun arose , that God prepared a sultry east wind ; and the sun beat on Jonah 's head , so that he fainted , and requested for himself that he might die , and said , " It is better for me to die than to live . "
Shouldn 't I be concerned for Nineveh , that great city , in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can 't discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much livestock ? "
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O earth , and all that is therein : and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
the mountains melt under him , and the valleys split apart , like wax before the fire , like waters that are poured down a steep place .
" all this is for the disobedience of Jacob , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the disobedience of Jacob ? isn 't it Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? aren 't they Jerusalem ?
all her idols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them , and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return . "
pass on , inhabitant of Shaphir , in nakedness and shame . the inhabitant of Zaanan won 't come out . the wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good , because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem .
therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath . the houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel .
I will yet bring to you , inhabitant of Mareshah . he who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam .
woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they covet fields , and seize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
shall it be said , O house of Jacob : " is the Spirit of Yahweh angry ? are these his doings ? Don 't my words do good to him who walks blamelessly ? "
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yahweh at their head .
I said , " Please listen , you heads of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel : isn 't it for you to know justice ?
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then they will cry to Yahweh , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray ; for those who feed their teeth , they proclaim , " Peace ! " and whoever doesn 't provide for their mouths , they prepare war against him :
and he will judge between many peoples , and will decide concerning strong nations afar off . they will beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . nation will not lift up sword against nation , neither will they learn war any more .
but they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken .
but they don 't know the thoughts of Yahweh , neither do they understand his counsel ; for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor .
arise and thresh , daughter of Zion ; for I will make your horn iron , and I will make your hoofs brass ; and you will beat in pieces many peoples : and I will devote their gain to Yahweh , and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
he shall stand , and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh , in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the earth .
he will be our peace when Assyria invades our land , and when he marches through our fortresses , then we will raise against him seven shepherds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in its gates . he will deliver us from the Assyrian , when he invades our land , and when he marches within our border .
the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples , like dew from Yahweh , like showers on the grass , that don 't wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries , and let all of your enemies be cut off .
hear , you mountains , Yahweh 's controversy , and you enduring foundations of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people , and he will contend with Israel .
for I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage . I sent before you Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
how shall I come before Yahweh , and bow myself before the exalted God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves a year old ?
will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams ? with tens of thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience ? the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
you shall eat , but not be satisfied . your humiliation will be in your midst . you will store up , but not save ; and that which you save I will give up to the sword .
for the statutes of Omri are kept , and all the works of the house of Ahab . you walk in their counsels , that I may make you a ruin , and her inhabitants a hissing ; And you will bear the reproach of my people . "
the godly man has perished out of the earth , and there is no one upright among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hunts his brother with a net .
the best of them is like a brier . the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge . the day of your watchmen , even your visitation , has come ; now is the time of their confusion .
but as for me , I will look to Yahweh . I will wait for the God of my salvation . my God will hear me .
Don 't rejoice against me , my enemy . when I fall , I will arise . when I sit in darkness , Yahweh will be a light to me .
then my enemy will see it , and shame will cover her who said to me , where is Yahweh your God ? then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame . now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets .
the nations will see and be ashamed of all their might . they will lay their hand on their mouth . their ears will be deaf .
who is a God like you , who pardons iniquity , and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage ? he doesn 't retain his anger forever , because he delights in loving kindness .
you will give truth to Jacob , and mercy to Abraham , as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old .
Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges . Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath . Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries , and he maintains wrath against his enemies .
he rebukes the sea , and makes it dry , and dries up all the rivers . Bashan languishes , and Carmel ; and the flower of Lebanon languishes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hills melt away . the earth trembles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who dwell in it .
who can stand before his indignation ? who can endure the fierceness of his anger ? his wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken apart by him .
what do you plot against Yahweh ? he will make a full end . affliction won 't rise up the second time .
thus says Yahweh : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have afflicted you , I will afflict you no more .
behold , on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news , who publishes peace ! keep your feasts , Judah ! perform your vows , for the wicked one will no more pass through you . he is utterly cut off .
for Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel ; for the destroyers have destroyed them , and ruined their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red . the valiant men are in scarlet . the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the pine spears are brandished .
the chariots rage in the streets . they rush back and forth in the broad ways . their appearance is like torches . they run like the lightnings .
it is decreed : she is uncovered , she is carried away ; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves , beating on their breasts .
but Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water , yet they flee away . " stop ! stop ! " they cry , but no one looks back .
where is the den of the lions , and the feeding place of the young lions , where the lion and the lioness walked , the lion 's cubs , and no one made them afraid ?
the lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his caves with the kill , and his dens with prey .
the noise of the whip , the noise of the rattling of wheels , prancing horses , and bounding chariots ,
because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute , the mistress of witchcraft , who sells nations through her prostitution , and families through her witchcraft .
" behold , I am against you , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and I will lift your skirts over your face . I will show the nations your nakedness , and the kingdoms your shame .
it will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you , and say , ' Nineveh is laid waste ! who will mourn for her ? ' where will I seek comforters for you ? "
are you better than No @-@ Amon , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
yet was she carried away . she went into captivity . her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets , and they cast lots for her honorable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
all your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first @-@ ripe figs : if they are shaken , they fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , your troops in your midst are women . the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies . the fire has devoured your bars .
there the fire will devour you . the sword will cut you off . it will devour you like the grasshopper . multiply like grasshoppers . multiply like the locust .
your shepherds slumber , king of Assyria . your nobles lie down . your people are scattered on the mountains , and there is no one to gather them .
why do you show me iniquity , and look at perversity ? for destruction and violence are before me . there is strife , and contention rises up .
for , behold , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , that march through the breadth of the earth , to possess dwelling places that are not theirs .
their horses also are swifter than leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves . their horsemen press proudly on . yes , their horsemen come from afar . they fly as an eagle that hurries to devour .
yes , he scoffs at kings , and princes are a derision to him . he laughs at every stronghold , for he builds up an earthen ramp , and takes it .
then he sweeps by like the wind , and goes on . he is indeed guilty , whose strength is his god . "
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the hook . he catches them in his net , and gathers them in his dragnet . therefore he rejoices and is glad .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ramparts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hurries toward the end , and won 't prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won 't delay .
yes , moreover , wine is treacherous . a haughty man who doesn 't stay at home , who enlarges his desire as Sheol , and he is like death , and can 't be satisfied , but gathers to himself all nations , and heaps to himself all peoples .
because you have plundered many nations , all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you , because of men 's blood , and for the violence done to the land , to the city and to all who dwell in it .
woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of evil !
" woe to him who gives his neighbor drink , pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk , so that you may gaze at their naked bodies !
you are filled with shame , and not glory . you will also drink , and be exposed ! the cup of Yahweh 's right hand will come around to you , and disgrace will cover your glory .
he stood , and shook the earth . he looked , and made the nations tremble . the ancient mountains were crumbled . the age @-@ old hills collapsed . his ways are eternal .
the mountains saw you , and were afraid . the storm of waters passed by . the deep roared and lifted up its hands on high .
you went forth for the salvation of your people , for the salvation of your anointed . you crushed the head of the land of wickedness . you stripped them head to foot . Selah .
for though the fig tree doesn 't flourish , nor fruit be in the vines ; the labor of the olive fails , the fields yield no food ; the flocks are cut off from the fold , and there is no herd in the stalls :
Yahweh , the Lord , is my strength . he makes my feet like deer 's feet , and enables me to go in high places . for the music director , on my stringed instruments .
the word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah , the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hezekiah , in the days of Josiah , the son of Amon , king of Judah .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh , for the day of Yahweh is at hand . for Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice . he has consecrated his guests .
in that day , I will punish all those who leap over the threshold , who fill their master 's house with violence and deceit .
it will happen at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with lamps , and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs , who say in their heart , " Yahweh will not do good , neither will he do evil . "
the great day of Yahweh is near . it is near , and hurries greatly , the voice of the day of Yahweh . the mighty man cries there bitterly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of distress and anguish , a day of trouble and ruin , a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and blackness ,
before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff , before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you , before the day of Yahweh 's anger comes on you .
seek Yahweh , all you humble of the land , who have kept his ordinances . seek righteousness . seek humility . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh 's anger .
woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast , the nation of the Cherethites ! the word of Yahweh is against you , Canaan , the land of the Philistines . I will destroy you , that there will be no inhabitant .
the coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah . they will find pasture . in the houses of Ashkelon , they will lie down in the evening , for Yahweh , their God , will visit them , and restore them .
Yahweh will be awesome to them , for he will famish all the gods of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the shores of the nations .
her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people . her priests have profaned the sanctuary . they have done violence to the law .
I have cut off nations . their battlements are desolate . I have made their streets waste , so that no one passes by . their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , so that there is no inhabitant .
the remnant of Israel will not do iniquity , nor speak lies , neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth , for they will feed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
in that day , it will be said to Jerusalem , " Don 't be afraid , Zion . Don 't let your hands be weak . "
at that time will I bring you in , and at that time will I gather you ; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth , when I restore your fortunes before your eyes , says Yahweh .
in the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai , the prophet , to Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , saying ,
" this is what Yahweh of Armies says : these people say , ' The time hasn 't yet come , the time for Yahweh 's house to be built . ' "
go up to the mountain , bring wood , and build the house . I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , " says Yahweh .
I called for a drought on the land , on the mountains , on the grain , on the new wine , on the oil , on that which the ground brings forth , on men , on livestock , and on all the labor of the hands . "
then Haggai , Yahweh 's messenger , spoke Yahweh 's message to the people , saying , " I am with you , " says Yahweh .
this is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spirit lived among you . ' Don 't be afraid . '
and I will shake all nations . the precious things of all nations will come , and I will fill this house with glory , says Yahweh of Armies .
'the latter glory of this house will be greater than the former , ' says Yahweh of Armies ; ' and in this place will I give peace , ' says Yahweh of Armies . "
then Haggai answered , " ' So is this people , and so is this nation before me , ' says Yahweh ; ' and so is every work of their hands . that which they offer there is unclean .
through all that time , when one came to a heap of twenty measures , there were only ten . when one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty , there were only twenty .
I struck you with blight , mildew , and hail in all the work of your hands ; yet you didn 't turn to me , ' says Yahweh .
is the seed yet in the barn ? yes , the vine , the fig tree , the pomegranate , and the olive tree haven 't brought forth . from this day will I bless you . ' "
the Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty @-@ fourth day of the month , saying ,
in that day , says Yahweh of Armies , will I take you , Zerubbabel , my servant , the son of Shealtiel , ' says Yahweh , ' and will make you as a signet , for I have chosen you , ' says Yahweh of Armies . "
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,
therefore tell them : thus says Yahweh of Armies : ' return to me , ' says Yahweh of Armies , ' and I will return to you , ' says Yahweh of Armies .
on the twenty @-@ fourth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Shebat , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,
then I asked , ' My lord , what are these ? ' " the angel who talked with me said to me , " I will show you what these are . "
the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered , " They are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth . "
then the angel of Yahweh replied , " O Yahweh of Armies , how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which you have had indignation these seventy years ? "
so the angel who talked with me said to me , " proclaim , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies : " I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy .
I am very angry with the nations that are at ease ; for I was but a little displeased , but they added to the calamity . "
therefore thus says Yahweh : " I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy . my house shall be built in it , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem . " '
" proclaim further , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies : " my cities will again overflow with prosperity , and Yahweh will again comfort Zion , and will again choose Jerusalem . " ' "
I asked the angel who talked with me , " What are these ? " he answered me , " These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem . "
then I asked , " Where are you going ? " he said to me , " To measure Jerusalem , to see what is its breadth and what is its length . "
come ! come ! flee from the land of the north , ' says Yahweh ; ' for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky , ' says Yahweh .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies : ' for honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you ; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye .
for , behold , I will shake my hand over them , and they will be a spoil to those who served them ; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me .
sing and rejoice , daughter of Zion ; for , behold , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of you , ' says Yahweh .
many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day , and shall be my people ; and I will dwell in the midst of you , and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Yahweh rebuke you , Satan ! yes , Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you ! isn 't this a burning stick plucked out of the fire ? "
he answered and spoke to those who stood before him , saying , " Take the filthy garments off of him . " to him he said , " Behold , I have caused your iniquity to pass from you , and I will clothe you with rich clothing . "
I said , " Let them set a clean Turban on his head . " so they set a clean Turban on his head , and clothed him ; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by .
hear now , Joshua the high priest , you and your fellows who sit before you ; for they are men who are a sign : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant , the Branch .
for , behold , the stone that I have set before Joshua ; on one stone are seven eyes : behold , I will engrave its engraving , ' says Yahweh of Armies , ' and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day .
and two olive trees by it , one on the right side of the bowl , and the other on the left side of it . "
I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me , saying , " What are these , my lord ? "
then he answered and spoke to me , saying , " This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel , saying , ' Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , ' says Yahweh of Armies .
" the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house . his hands shall also finish it ; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
then I asked him , " What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it ? "
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are beside the two golden spouts , that pour the golden oil out of themselves ? "
then again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a flying scroll .
he said to me , " What do you see ? " I answered , " I see a flying scroll ; its length is twenty cubits , and its breadth ten cubits . "
then he said to me , " This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land ; for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side ; and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the other side .
then the angel who talked with me came forward , and said to me , " Lift up now your eyes , and see what is this that is appearing . "
I said , " What is it ? " he said , " This is the ephah basket that is appearing . " he said moreover , " This is their appearance in all the land
he said , " This is Wickedness " ; and he threw her down into the midst of the ephah basket ; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth .
then I said to the angel who talked with me , " Where are these carrying the ephah basket ? "
the angel answered me , " These are the four winds of the sky , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
then he called to me , and spoke to me , saying , " Behold , those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country . "
" take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah , where they have come from Babylon .
yes , take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest ;
even he shall build Yahweh 's temple ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule on his throne ; and he shall be a priest on his throne ; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
the crowns shall be to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in Yahweh 's temple .
and to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of Armies , and to the prophets , saying , " Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these so many years ? "
" speak to all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , ' When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years , did you at all fast to me , really to me ?
aren 't these the words which Yahweh proclaimed by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and its cities around her , and the South and the lowland were inhabited ? ' "
yes , they made their hearts as hard as flint , lest they might hear the law , and the words which Yahweh of Armies had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets . therefore great wrath came from Yahweh of Armies .
it has come to pass that , as he called , and they refused to listen , so they will call , and I will not listen , " said Yahweh of Armies ;
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I am jealous for her with great wrath . "
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " if it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days , should it also be marvelous in my eyes ? " says Yahweh of Armies .
and I will bring them , and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem ; and they will be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness . "
" for the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit , and the ground will give its increase , and the heavens will give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things .
it shall come to pass that , as you were a curse among the nations , house of Judah and house of Israel , so will I save you , and you shall be a blessing . Don 't be afraid . let your hands be strong . "
so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah . Don 't be afraid .
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neighbor . execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " the fasts of the fourth fifth , seventh , and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy and gladness , and cheerful feasts . therefore love truth and peace . "
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " many peoples , and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come ;
and the inhabitants of one shall go to another , saying , ' Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh , and to seek Yahweh of Armies . I will go also . '
yes , many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem , and to entreat the favor of Yahweh . "
an oracle . the word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach , and will rest upon Damascus ; for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh ;
behold , the Lord will dispossess her , and he will strike her power in the sea ; and she will be devoured with fire .
Ashkelon will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will writhe in agony ; as will Ekron , for her expectation will be disappointed ; and the king will perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
I will take away his blood out of his mouth , and his abominations from between his teeth ; and he also will be a remnant for our God ; and he will be as a chieftain in Judah , and Ekron as a Jebusite .
rejoice greatly , daughter of Zion ! shout , daughter of Jerusalem ! behold , your King comes to you ! he is righteous , and having salvation ; lowly , and riding on a donkey , even on a colt , the foal of a donkey .
I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim , and the horse from Jerusalem ; and the battle bow will be cut off ; and he will speak peace to the nations : and his dominion will be from sea to sea , and from the River to the ends of the earth .
as for you also , because of the blood of your covenant , I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water .
turn to the stronghold , you prisoners of hope ! even today I declare that I will restore double to you .
Yahweh will be seen over them ; and his arrow will go flash like lightning ; and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet , and will go with whirlwinds of the south .
for how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! grain will make the young men flourish , and new wine the virgins .
ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time , Yahweh who makes storm clouds , and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field .
for the teraphim have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie ; and they have told false dreams . they comfort in vain . therefore they go their way like sheep . they are oppressed , because there is no shepherd .
my anger is kindled against the shepherds , and I will punish the male goats ; For Yahweh of Armies has visited his flock , the house of Judah , and will make them as his majestic horse in the battle .
Ephraim will be like a mighty man , and their heart will rejoice as through wine ; yes , their children will see it , and rejoice . their heart will be glad in Yahweh .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon ; and there won 't be room enough for them .
I will strengthen them in Yahweh ; and they will walk up and down in his name , " says Yahweh .
wail , fir tree , for the cedar has fallen , because the stately ones are destroyed . wail , you oaks of Bashan , for the strong forest has come down .
a voice of the wailing of the shepherds ! for their glory is destroyed : a voice of the roaring of young lions ! for the pride of the Jordan is ruined .
their buyers slaughter them , and go unpunished . those who sell them say , ' Blessed be Yahweh , for I am rich ; ' and their own shepherds don 't pity them .
so I fed the flock of slaughter , especially the oppressed of the flock . I took for myself two staffs . the one I called " Favor , " and the other I called " Union , " and I fed the flock .
Yahweh said to me , " Throw it to the potter , the handsome price that I was valued at by them ! " I took the thirty pieces of silver , and threw them to the potter , in the house of Yahweh .
" behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples , and on Judah also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
it will happen in that day , that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples . all who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded , and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it .
in that day , " says Yahweh , " I will strike every horse with terror , and his rider with madness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah , and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness .
the chieftains of Judah will say in their heart , ' The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God . '
in that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . he who is feeble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Yahweh before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
in that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem , like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
the land will mourn , every family apart ; the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
the family of the house of Levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the Shimeites apart , and their wives apart ;
one will say to him , ' What are these wounds between your arms ? ' then he will answer , ' Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yahweh , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city will be taken , the houses rifled , and the women ravished . half of the city will go out into captivity , and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city .
then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
it will happen in that day , that there will not be light , cold , or frost .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clothing , in great abundance .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the donkey , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn 't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , on them there will be no rain .
if the family of Egypt doesn 't go up , and doesn 't come , neither will it rain on them . this will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don 't go up to keep the feast of tents .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don 't go up to keep the feast of tents .
in that day there will be on the bells of the horses , " HOLY TO Yahweh " ; and the pots in Yahweh 's house will be like the bowls before the altar .
" now , please entreat the favor of God , that he may be gracious to us . with this , will he accept any of you ? " says Yahweh of Armies .
" Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors , that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain ! I have no pleasure in you , " says Yahweh of Armies , " neither will I accept an offering at your hand .
you will know that I have sent this commandment to you , that my covenant may be with Levi , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" my covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me ; and he was reverent toward me , and stood in awe of my name .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies .
" therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people , according to the way you have not kept my ways , but have had respect for persons in the law .
Judah has dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves , and has married the daughter of a foreign god .
this again you do : you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears , with weeping , and with sighing , because he doesn 't regard the offering any more , neither receives it with good will at your hand .
for I hate divorce , " says Yahweh , the God of Israel , " and him who covers his garment with violence ! " says Yahweh of Armies . " therefore take heed to your spirit , that you don 't deal treacherously .
" but who can endure the day of his coming ? and who will stand when he appears ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like launderer 's soap ;
and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver , and he will purify the sons of Levi , and refine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness .
from the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances , and have not kept them . return to me , and I will return to you , " says Yahweh of Armies . " but you say , ' How shall we return ? '
" your words have been stout against me , " says Yahweh . " yet you say , ' What have we spoken against you ? '
you have said , ' It is vain to serve God ; ' and ' What profit is it that we have followed his instructions , and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies ?
then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another ; and Yahweh listened , and heard , and a book of memory was written before him , for those who feared Yahweh , and who honored his name .
they shall be mine , " says Yahweh of Armies , " my own possession in the day that I make , and I will spare them , as a man spares his own son who serves him .
then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him who serves God and him who doesn 't serve him .
you shall tread down the wicked ; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make , " says Yahweh of Armies .
he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers , lest I come and strike the earth with a curse . "
after the exile to Babylon , Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
Joseph , her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , intended to put her away secretly .
but when he thought about these things , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , " Joseph , son of David , don 't be afraid to take to yourself Mary , your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name Jesus , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod , behold , wise men from the east came to Jerusalem , saying ,
'You Bethlehem , land of Judah , are in no way least among the princes of Judah : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall shepherd my people , Israel . ' "
he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , " Go and search diligently for the young child . when you have found him , bring me word , so that I also may come and worship him . "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
and was there until the death of Herod ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
" a voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation , weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; she wouldn 't be comforted , because they are no more . "
but when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying ,
" arise and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel , for those who sought the young child 's life are dead . "
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
and came and lived in a city called Nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets : " he will be called a Nazarene . "
but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism , he said to them , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
" even now the axe lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you in water for repentance , but he who comes after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to carry . he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit .
but Jesus , answering , said to him , " Allow it now , for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness . " then he allowed him .
behold , a voice out of the heavens said , " This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . "
but he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God . ' "
then the devil took him into the holy city . he set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
again , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory .
leaving Nazareth , he came and lived in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
" the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , toward the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has dawned . "
rejoice , and be exceedingly glad , for great is your reward in heaven . for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
" you are the salt of the earth , but if the salt has lost its flavor , with what will it be salted ? it is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men .
even so , let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
" Don 't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets . I didn 't come to destroy , but to fulfill .
whoever , therefore , shall break one of these least commandments , and teach others to do so , shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven ; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven .
for I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
most certainly I tell you , you shall by no means get out of there , until you have paid the last penny .
if your right eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
" it was also said , ' Whoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorce , '
but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife , except for the cause of sexual immorality , makes her an adulteress ; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery .
nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
give to him who asks you , and don 't turn away him who desires to borrow from you .
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you ,
" be careful that you don 't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
therefore when you do merciful deeds , don 't sound a trumpet before yourself , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may get glory from men . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
" when you pray , you shall not be as the hypocrites , for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by men . most certainly , I tell you , they have received their reward .
but you , when you pray , enter into your inner room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
in praying , don 't use vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do ; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking .
" moreover when you fast , don 't be like the hypocrites , with sad faces . for they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen by men to be fasting . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" Don 't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
" the lamp of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
" no one can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other ; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other . you can 't serve both God and Mammon .
therefore I tell you , don 't be anxious for your life : what you will eat , or what you will drink ; nor yet for your body , what you will wear . isn 't life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
see the birds of the sky , that they don 't sow , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns . your heavenly Father feeds them . aren 't you of much more value than they ?
why are you anxious about clothing ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . they don 't toil , neither do they spin ,
but if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , won 't he much more clothe you , you of little faith ?
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
why do you see the speck that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
you hypocrite ! first remove the beam out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother 's eye .
" Don 't give that which is holy to the dogs , neither throw your pearls before the pigs , lest perhaps they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
how narrow is the gate , and restricted is the way that leads to life ! few are those who find it .
not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven ; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
" everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
behold , a leper came to him and worshiped him , saying , " Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . "
Jesus stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
Jesus said to him , " See that you tell nobody , but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . "
and saying , " Lord , my servant lies in the house paralyzed , grievously tormented . "
for I am also a man under authority , having under myself soldiers . I tell this one , ' Go , ' and he goes ; and tell another , ' Come , ' and he comes ; and tell my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
when Jesus heard it , he marveled , and said to those who followed , " Most certainly I tell you , I haven 't found so great a faith , not even in Israel .
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and will sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven ,
when Jesus came into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick with a fever .
when evening came , they brought to him many possessed with demons . he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying : " he took our infirmities , and bore our diseases . "
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . "
behold , a violent storm came up on the sea , so much that the boat was covered with the waves , but he was asleep .
he said to them , " Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , rebuked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
the men marveled , saying , " What kind of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
when he came to the other side , into the country of the Gergesenes , two people possessed by demons met him there , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that nobody could pass that way .
behold , they cried out , saying , " What do we have to do with you , Jesus , Son of God ? have you come here to torment us before the time ? "
he said to them , " Go ! " they came out , and went into the herd of pigs : and behold , the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea , and died in the water .
behold , they brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a bed . Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , cheer up ! your sins are forgiven you . "
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ... " ( then he said to the paralytic ) , " Get up , and take up your mat , and go up to your house . "
but you go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
then John 's disciples came to him , saying , " Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples don 't fast ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
neither do people put new wine into old wineskins , or else the skins would burst , and the wine be spilled , and the skins ruined . no , they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved . "
behold , a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him , and touched the fringe of his garment ;
but Jesus , turning around and seeing her , said , " Daughter , cheer up ! your faith has made you well . " and the woman was made well from that hour .
when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the flute players , and the crowd in noisy disorder ,
he said to them , " Make room , because the girl isn 't dead , but sleeping . " they were ridiculing him .
as Jesus passed by from there , two blind men followed him , calling out and saying , " Have mercy on us , son of David ! "
when he had come into the house , the blind men came to him . Jesus said to them , " Do you believe that I am able to do this ? " they told him , " Yes , Lord . "
Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these . the first , Simon , who is called Peter ; Andrew , his brother ; James the son of Zebedee ; John , his brother ;
Philip ; Bartholomew ; Thomas ; Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus ; Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
yes , and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
but when they deliver you up , don 't be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
Don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
he who seeks his life will lose it ; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
it happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples , he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities .
as these went their way , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? behold , those who wear soft clothing are in king 's houses .
but why did you go out ? to see a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
the Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ' Behold , a gluttonous man and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ' but wisdom is justified by her children . "
" woe to you , Chorazin ! woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
but I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to Hades . for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
all things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows the Son , except the Father ; neither does anyone know the Father , except the Son , and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him .
take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
but the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , " Behold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbath day , the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath , and are guiltless ?
but if you had known what this means , ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guiltless .
and behold there was a man with a withered hand . they asked him , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? " that they might accuse him .
then he told the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he stretched it out ; and it was restored whole , just like the other .
but the Pharisees went out , and conspired against him , how they might destroy him .
" behold , my servant whom I have chosen ; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit on him . he will proclaim justice to the nations .
he won 't break a bruised reed . he won 't quench a smoking flax , until he leads justice to victory .
then one possessed by a demon , blind and mute , was brought to him and he healed him , so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , " This man does not cast out demons , except by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
but if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come upon you .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will plunder his house .
therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
" either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by its fruit .
for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn 't find it .
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this evil generation . "
he spoke to them many things in parables , saying , " Behold , a farmer went out to sow .
others fell on rocky ground , where they didn 't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
he answered them , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it is not given to them .
therefore I speak to them in parables , because seeing they don 't see , and hearing , they don 't hear , neither do they understand .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; Seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
yet he has no root in himself , but endures for a while . when oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he stumbles .
what was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
what was sown on the good ground , this is he who hears the word , and understands it , who most certainly bears fruit , and brings forth , some one hundred times as much , some sixty , and some thirty . "
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then the darnel weeds appeared also .
the servants of the householder came and said to him , ' Sir , didn 't you sow good seed in your field ? where did this darnel come from ? '
" he said to them , ' An enemy has done this . ' " the servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
" but he said , ' No , lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds , you root up the wheat with them .
let both grow together until the harvest , and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers , " First , gather up the darnel weeds , and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my barn . " ' "
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field ;
which indeed is smaller than all seeds . but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches . "
he spoke another parable to them . " the Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , until it was all leavened . "
then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field . "
the enemy who sowed them is the devil . the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
and will cast them into the furnace of fire . there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found , and hid . in his joy , he goes and sells all that he has , and buys that field .
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
coming into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , " Where did this man get this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
they were offended by him . but Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house . "
and said to his servants , " This is John the Baptizer . he is risen from the dead . that is why these powers work in him . "
for Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife .
when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
she , being prompted by her mother , said , " Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer . "
now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat , to a deserted place apart . when the multitudes heard it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
when evening had come , his disciples came to him , saying , " This place is deserted , and the hour is already late . send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , " It 's a ghost ! " and they cried out for fear .
those who were in the boat came and worshiped him , saying , " You are truly the Son of God ! "
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
" why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders ? for they don 't wash their hands when they eat bread . "
but you say , ' Whoever may tell his father or his mother , " Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God , "
leave them alone . they are blind guides of the blind . if the blind guide the blind , both will fall into a pit . "
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , sexual sins , thefts , false testimony , and blasphemies .
behold , a Canaanite woman came out from those borders , and cried , saying , " Have mercy on me , Lord , you son of David ! my daughter is severely demonized ! "
Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
Jesus summoned his disciples and said , " I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat . I don 't want to send them away fasting , or they might faint on the way . "
the disciples said to him , " Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude ? "
Jesus said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? " they said , " Seven , and a few small fish . "
and he took the seven loaves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . " he left them , and departed .
then they understood that he didn 't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
Peter took him aside , and began to rebuke him , saying , " Far be it from you , Lord ! this will never be done to you . "
but he turned , and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! you are a stumbling block to me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of men . "
then Jesus said to his disciples , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and forfeits his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom . "
Peter answered , and said to Jesus , " Lord , it is good for us to be here . if you want , let 's make three tents here : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
while he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them . behold , a voice came out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . listen to him . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , " Don 't tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
but I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they didn 't recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted to . even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them . "
" Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is epileptic , and suffers grievously ; for he often falls into the fire , and often into the water .
then the disciples came to Jesus privately , and said , " Why weren 't we able to cast it out ? "
and they will kill him , and the third day he will be raised up . " they were exceedingly sorry .
when they had come to Capernaum , those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter , and said , " doesn 't your teacher pay the didrachma ? "
Peter said to him , " From strangers . " Jesus said to him , " Therefore the children are exempt .
in that hour the disciples came to Jesus , saying , " Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven ? "
and said , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you turn , and become as little children , you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck , and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea .
if your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire .
see that you don 't despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
" what do you think ? if a man has one hundred sheep , and one of them goes astray , doesn 't he leave the ninety @-@ nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone astray ?
" if your brother sins against you , go , show him his fault between you and him alone . if he listens to you , you have gained back your brother .
but if he doesn 't listen , take one or two more with you , that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
" but that servant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred denarii , and he grabbed him , and took him by the throat , saying , ' Pay me what you owe ! '
" so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
Shouldn 't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant , even as I had mercy on you ? '
his lord was angry , and delivered him to the tormentors , until he should pay all that was due to him .
they asked him , " Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce , and divorce her ? "
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another , commits adultery ; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery . "
he said to him , " Why do you call me good ? no one is good but one , that is , God . but if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
the young man said to him , " All these things I have observed from my youth . what do I still lack ? "
Jesus said to him , " If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sad , for he was one who had great possessions .
Jesus said to his disciples , " Most certainly I say to you , a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty .
looking at them , Jesus said , " With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . "
Jesus said to them , " Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory , you also will sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
to them he said , ' You also go into the vineyard , and whatever is right I will give you . ' so they went their way .
" they said to him , ' Because no one has hired us . ' " he said to them , ' You also go into the vineyard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
when evening had come , the lord of the vineyard said to his manager , ' Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last to the first . '
saying , ' These last have spent one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat ! '
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
isn 't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
so the last will be first , and the first last . for many are called , but few are chosen . "
as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them ,
" behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death ,
he said to her , " What do you want ? " she said to him , " Command that these , my two sons , may sit , one on your right hand , and one on your left hand , in your Kingdom . "
but Jesus summoned them , and said , " You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
behold , two blind men sitting by the road , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
" tell the daughter of Zion , behold , your King comes to you , humble , and riding on a donkey , on a colt , the foal of a donkey . "
and said to him , " Do you hear what these are saying ? " Jesus said to them , " Yes . did you never read , ' Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise ? ' "
when he had come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching , and said , " By what authority do you do these things ? who gave you this authority ? "
the baptism of John , where was it from ? from heaven or from men ? " they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask us , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
they answered Jesus , and said , " We don 't know . " he also said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
he came to the second , and said the same thing . he answered , ' I go , sir , ' but he didn 't go .
for John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you didn 't believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . when you saw it , you didn 't even repent afterward , that you might believe him .
when the season for the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruit .
they told him , " He will miserably destroy those miserable men , and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers , who will give him the fruit in its season . "
Jesus said to them , " Did you never read in the Scriptures , ' The stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner . this was from the Lord . it is marvelous in our eyes ? '
he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , but on whomever it will fall , it will scatter him as dust . "
when they sought to seize him , they feared the multitudes , because they considered him to be a prophet .
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast , but they would not come .
" then he said to his servants , ' The wedding is ready , but those who were invited weren 't worthy .
but when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who didn 't have on wedding clothing ,
and he said to him , ' Friend , how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing ? ' he was speechless .
'the Lord said to my Lord , sit on my right hand , until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ? '
no one was able to answer him a word , neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth .
but don 't you be called ' Rabbi , ' for one is your teacher , the Christ , and all of you are brothers .
woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte ; and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves .
" woe to you , you blind guides , who say , ' Whoever swears by the temple , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple , he is obligated . '
" woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you tithe mint , dill , and Cumin , and have left undone the weightier matters of the law : justice , mercy , and faith . but you ought to have done these , and not to have left the other undone .
" woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness .
you blind Pharisee , first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter , that its outside may become clean also .
" woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like whitened tombs , which outwardly appear beautiful , but inwardly are full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah , whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar .
" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , who kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! how often I would have gathered your children together , even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , and you would not !
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
as he sat on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , " Tell us , when will these things be ? what is the sign of your coming , and of the end of the age ? "
then they will deliver you up to oppression , and will kill you . you will be hated by all of the nations for my name 's sake .
this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
" when , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
" then if any man tells you , ' Behold , here is the Christ , ' or , ' There , ' don 't believe it .
if therefore they tell you , ' Behold , he is in the wilderness , ' don 't go out ; ' Behold , he is in the inner rooms , ' don 't believe it .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
" now from the fig tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
most certainly I tell you , this generation will not pass away , until all these things are accomplished .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
and they didn 't know until the flood came , and took them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord has set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
and will cut him in pieces , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites . there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be .
" then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went out to meet the bridegroom .
the foolish said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
but the wise answered , saying , ' What if there isn 't enough for us and you ? you go rather to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . '
while they went away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was shut .
to one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his own ability . then he went on his journey .
he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents . behold , I have gained another five talents besides them . '
" his lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . you have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . enter into the joy of your lord . '
" his lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . you have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . enter into the joy of your lord . '
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
you ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest .
throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . '
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
before him all the nations will be gathered , and he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
then the King will tell those on his right hand , ' Come , blessed of my Father , inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world ;
for I was hungry , and you gave me food to eat . I was thirsty , and you gave me drink . I was a stranger , and you took me in .
when did we see you as a stranger , and take you in ; or naked , and clothe you ?
" the King will answer them , ' Most certainly I tell you , inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' Depart from me , you cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
for I was hungry , and you didn 't give me food to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me no drink ;
I was a stranger , and you didn 't take me in ; naked , and you didn 't clothe me ; sick , and in prison , and you didn 't visit me . '
" you know that after two days the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified . "
however , knowing this , Jesus said to them , " Why do you trouble the woman ? because she has done a good work for me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests ,
they were exceedingly sorrowful , and each began to ask him , " It isn 't me , is it , Lord ? "
Judas , who betrayed him , answered , " It isn 't me , is it , Rabbi ? " he said to him , " You said it . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , gave thanks for it , and broke it . he gave to the disciples , and said , " Take , eat ; this is my body . "
for this is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many for the remission of sins .
but I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father 's Kingdom . "
but Peter answered him , " Even if all will be made to stumble because of you , I will never be made to stumble . "
he went forward a little , fell on his face , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from me ; nevertheless , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " What , couldn 't you watch with me for one hour ?
watch and pray , that you don 't enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
while he was still speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priest and elders of the people .
now he who betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , " Whoever I kiss , he is the one . seize him . "
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
then Jesus said to him , " Put your sword back into its place , for all those who take the sword will die by the sword .
but all this has happened , that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . " then all the disciples left him , and fled .
but Peter followed him from a distance , to the court of the high priest , and entered in and sat with the officers , to see the end .
the high priest stood up , and said to him , " Have you no answer ? what is this that these testify against you ? "
then the high priest tore his clothing , saying , " He has spoken blasphemy ! why do we need any more witnesses ? behold , now you have heard his blasphemy .
now Peter was sitting outside in the court , and a maid came to him , saying , " You were also with Jesus , the Galilean ! "
but he denied it before them all , saying , " I don 't know what you are talking about . "
when he had gone out onto the porch , someone else saw him , and said to those who were there , " This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter , " Surely you are also one of them , for your speech makes you known . "
Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him , " Before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . " he went out and wept bitterly .
now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus was condemned , felt remorse , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , " I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood . " but they said , " What is that to us ? you see to it . "
he threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary , and departed . he went away and hanged himself .
when therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said to them , " Whom do you want me to release to you ? Barabbas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? "
while he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent to him , saying , " Have nothing to do with that righteous man , for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him . "
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
but the governor answered them , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " they said , " Barabbas ! "
they set up over his head the accusation against him written , " THIS IS JESUS , THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
and saying , " You who destroy the temple , and build it in three days , save yourself ! if you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! "
likewise the chief priests also mocking , with the scribes , the Pharisees , and the elders , said ,
" he saved others , but he can 't save himself . if he is the King of Israel , let him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in him .
he trusts in God . let God deliver him now , if he wants him ; for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " Eli , Eli , lima sabachthani ? " that is , " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? "
immediately one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him a drink .
the rest said , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to save him . "
behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the earth quaked and the rocks were split .
now the centurion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , " Truly this was the Son of God . "
this man went to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body . then Pilate commanded the body to be given up .
and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut out in the rock , and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and departed .
command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away , and tell the people , ' He is risen from the dead ; ' and the last deception will be worse than the first . "
now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
he is not here , for he has risen , just like he said . come , see the place where the Lord was lying .
go quickly and tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead , and behold , he goes before you into Galilee ; there you will see him . ' behold , I have told you . "
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
so they took the money and did as they were told . this saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continues until this day .
go , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
all the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him . they were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
he preached , saying , " After me comes he who is mightier than I , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen .
a voice came out of the sky , " You are my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , " What is this ? a new teaching ? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him ! "
he said to them , " Let 's go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also , because I came out for this reason . "
a leper came to him , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
and said to him , " See you say nothing to anybody , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
but he went out , and began to proclaim it much , and to spread about the matter , so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city , but was outside in desert places : and they came to him from everywhere .
immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even around the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on .
which is easier , to tell the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' Arise , and take up your bed , and walk ? '
he arose , and immediately took up the mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
as he passed by , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , " Follow me . " and he arose and followed him .
it happened , that he was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
the scribes and the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , " Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can 't fast .
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
no one puts new wine into old wineskins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and the wine pours out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins . "
the Pharisees said to him , " Behold , why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? "
how he entered into God 's house when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
when he had looked around at them with anger , being grieved at the hardening of their hearts , he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he stretched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn 't press on him .
the unclean spirits , whenever they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , " You are the Son of God ! "
James the son of Zebedee ; John , the brother of James , and he surnamed them Boanerges , which means , Sons of Thunder ;
Andrew ; Philip ; Bartholomew ; Matthew ; Thomas ; James , the son of Alphaeus ; Thaddaeus ; Simon the Zealot ;
the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , " He has Beelzebul , " and , " By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons . "
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder , unless he first binds the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house .
most certainly I tell you , all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven , including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme ;
looking around at those who sat around him , he said , " Behold , my mother and my brothers !
again he began to teach by the seaside . a great multitude was gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat in the sea , and sat down . all the multitude were on the land by the sea .
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing . some brought forth thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times as much . "
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
he said to them , " Don 't you understand this parable ? how will you understand all of the parables ?
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
these in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with joy .
those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
for there is nothing hidden , except that it should be made known ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
he said to them , " Take heed what you hear . with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you , and more will be given to you who hear .
yet when it is sown , grows up , and becomes greater than all the herbs , and puts out great branches , so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow . "
with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
a big wind storm arose , and the waves beat into the boat , so much that the boat was already filled .
he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion , and they woke him up , and told him , " Teacher , don 't you care that we are dying ? "
he awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace ! be still ! " the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
he said to them , " Why are you so afraid ? how is it that you have no faith ? "
they were greatly afraid , and said to one another , " Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
at once Jesus gave them permission . the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs . the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and they were drowned in the sea .
those who fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the legion ; and they were afraid .
those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons , and about the pigs .
as he was entering into the boat , he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him .
he went his way , and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him , and everyone marveled .
when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
and begged him much , saying , " My little daughter is at the point of death . please come and lay your hands on her , that she may be made healthy , and live . "
having heard the things concerning Jesus , came up behind him in the crowd , and touched his clothes .
his disciples said to him , " You see the multitude pressing against you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
while he was still speaking , people came from the synagogue ruler 's house saying , " Your daughter is dead . why bother the Teacher any more ? "
he came to the synagogue ruler 's house , and he saw an uproar , weeping , and great wailing .
they ridiculed him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
isn 't this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , Joses , Judah , and Simon ? aren 't his sisters here with us ? " they were offended at him .
Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . "
he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people , and healed them .
he called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
King Herod heard this , for his name had become known , and he said , " John the Baptizer has risen from the dead , and therefore these powers are at work in him . "
but others said , " He is Elijah . " others said , " He is a prophet , or like one of the prophets . "
but Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . he has risen from the dead . "
for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and kept him safe . when he heard him , he did many things , and he heard him gladly .
he swore to her , " Whatever you shall ask of me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . "
she came in immediately with haste to the king , and asked , " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter . "
the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
he said to them , " You come apart into a deserted place , and rest awhile . " for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
send them away , that they may go into the surrounding country and villages , and buy themselves bread , for they have nothing to eat . "
but he answered them , " You give them something to eat . " they asked him , " Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread , and give them something to eat ? "
he said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? go see . " when they knew , they said , " Five , and two fish . "
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke the loaves , and he gave to his disciples to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
seeing them distressed in rowing , for the wind was contrary to them , about the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea , and he would have passed by them ,
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " Cheer up ! it is I ! Don 't be afraid . "
and ran around that whole region , and began to bring those who were sick , on their mats , to where they heard he was .
then the Pharisees , and some of the scribes gathered together to him , having come from Jerusalem .
they don 't eat when they come from the marketplace , unless they bathe themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : washings of cups , pitchers , bronze vessels , and couches . )
the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , " Why don 't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with unwashed hands ? "
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
making void the word of God by your tradition , which you have handed down . you do many things like this . "
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man .
for from within , out of the hearts of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , sexual sins , murders , thefts ,
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . he entered into a house , and didn 't want anyone to know it , but he couldn 't escape notice .
now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . she begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
he said to her , " For this saying , go your way . the demon has gone out of your daughter . "
he commanded them that they should tell no one , but the more he commanded them , so much the more widely they proclaimed it .
they were astonished beyond measure , saying , " He has done all things well . he makes even the deaf hear , and the mute speak ! "
in those days , when there was a very great multitude , and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to himself , and said to them ,
" I have compassion on the multitude , because they have stayed with me now three days , and have nothing to eat .
if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven loaves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his disciples to serve , and they served the multitude .
he sighed deeply in his spirit , and said , " Why does this generation seek a sign ? most certainly I tell you , no sign will be given to this generation . "
he warned them , saying , " Take heed : beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . "
when I broke the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " they told him , " Twelve . "
he took hold of the blind man by the hand , and brought him out of the village . when he had spit on his eyes , and laid his hands on him , he asked him if he saw anything .
he sent him away to his house , saying , " Don 't enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
Jesus went out , with his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi . on the way he asked his disciples , " Who do men say that I am ? "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
but he , turning around , and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , and said , " Get behind me , Satan ! for you have in mind not the things of God , but the things of men . "
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power . "
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
Peter answered Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
but I tell you that Elijah has come , and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to , even as it is written about him . "
and wherever it seizes him , it throws him down , and he foams at the mouth , and grinds his teeth , and wastes away . I asked your disciples to cast it out , and they weren 't able . "
they brought him to him , and when he saw him , immediately the spirit convulsed him , and he fell on the ground , wallowing and foaming at the mouth .
he asked his father , " How long has it been since this has come to him ? " he said , " From childhood .
often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water , to destroy him . but if you can do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . "
when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , " You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and never enter him again ! "
having cried out , and convulsed greatly , it came out of him . the boy became like one dead ; so much that most of them said , " He is dead . "
he took a little child , and set him in their midst . taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck .
if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched--
if your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
salt is good , but if the salt has lost its saltiness , with what will you season it ? have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
he arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . multitudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
they were bringing to him little children , that he should touch them , but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them .
as he was going out into the way , one ran to him , knelt before him , and asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? "
the disciples were amazed at his words . but Jesus answered again , " Children , how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
Jesus , looking at them , said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God , for all things are possible with God . "
" behold , we are going up to Jerusalem . the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes . they will condemn him to death , and will deliver him to the Gentiles .
James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came near to him , saying , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we will ask . "
but Jesus said to them , " You don 't know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
they said to him , " We are able . " Jesus said to them , " You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink , and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ;
but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give , but for whom it has been prepared . "
Jesus summoned them , and said to them , " You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
they came to Jericho . as he went out from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the road .
Jesus asked him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " the blind man said to him , " Rabboni , that I may see again . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your faith has made you well . " immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
and said to them , " Go your way into the village that is opposite you . immediately as you enter into it , you will find a young donkey tied , on which no one has sat . untie him , and bring him .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs him ; ' and immediately he will send him back here . "
some of those who stood there asked them , " What are you doing , untying the young donkey ? "
the chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . for they feared him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone ; so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your transgressions .
they came again to Jerusalem , and as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders came to him ,
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
haven 't you even read this Scripture : ' the stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner .
they tried to seize him , but they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them . they left him , and went away .
one of the scribes came , and heard them questioning together . knowing that he had answered them well , asked him , " Which commandment is the greatest of all ? "
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
the second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' there is no other commandment greater than these . "
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the Kingdom of God . " no one dared ask him any question after that .
Jesus responded , as he taught in the temple , " How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
in his teaching he said to them , " Beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes , and to get greetings in the marketplaces ,
Jesus sat down opposite the treasury , and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury . many who were rich cast in much .
he called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings ! "
Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? there will not be left here one stone on another , which will not be thrown down . "
" tell us , when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled ? "
when they lead you away and deliver you up , don 't be anxious beforehand , or premeditate what you will say , but say whatever will be given you in that hour . for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when you see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ,
for in those days there will be oppression , such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the sake of the chosen ones , whom he picked out , he shortened the days .
" now from the fig tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
even so you also , when you see these things coming to pass , know that it is near , at the doors .
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
watch therefore , for you don 't know when the lord of the house is coming , whether at evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning ;
for they said , " Not during the feast , because there might be a riot of the people . "
while he was at Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at the table , a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly . she broke the jar , and poured it over his head .
but there were some who were indignant among themselves , saying , " Why has this ointment been wasted ?
for you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might deliver him to them .
on the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the Passover , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover ? "
he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , " Go into the city , and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water . follow him ,
and wherever he enters in , tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? " '
they began to be sorrowful , and to ask him one by one , " Surely not I ? " and another said , " Surely not I ? "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had blessed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body . "
he said to them , " This is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many .
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God . "
Jesus said to him , " Most certainly I tell you , that you today , even this night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . "
he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
he said , " Abba , Father , all things are possible to you . please remove this cup from me . however , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
watch and pray , that you may not enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
now he who betrayed him had given them a sign , saying , " whomever I will kiss , that is he . seize him , and lead him away safely . "
I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me . but this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled . "
a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
they led Jesus away to the high priest . all the chief priests , the elders , and the scribes came together with him .
" we heard him say , ' I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . ' "
the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , " Have you no answer ? what is it which these testify against you ? "
but he stayed quiet , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? "
you have heard the blasphemy ! what do you think ? " they all condemned him to be worthy of death .
some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to tell him , " Prophesy ! " the officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
as Peter was in the courtyard below , one of the maids of the high priest came ,
and seeing Peter warming himself , she looked at him , and said , " You were also with the Nazarene , Jesus ! "
but he again denied it . after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter , " You truly are one of them , for you are a Galilean , and your speech shows it . "
but he began to curse , and to swear , " I don 't know this man of whom you speak ! "
the rooster crowed the second time . Peter remembered the word , how that Jesus said to him , " Before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . " when he thought about that , he wept .
but the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should release Barabbas to them instead .
Pilate said to them , " Why , what evil has he done ? " but they cried out exceedingly , " Crucify him ! "
Pilate , wishing to please the multitude , released Barabbas to them , and handed over Jesus , when he had flogged him , to be crucified .
when they had mocked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . they led him out to crucify him .
those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads , and saying , " Ha ! you who destroy the temple , and build it in three days ,
let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe him . " those who were crucified with him insulted him .
at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " which is , being interpreted , " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? "
when the centurion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , " Truly this man was the Son of God ! "
Joseph of Arimathaea , a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God , came . he boldly went in to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
he bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
he said to them , " Don 't be amazed . you seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who has been crucified . he has risen . he is not here . behold , the place where they laid him !
they went out , and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had come on them . they said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
these signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak with new languages ;
they will take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it will in no way hurt them ; they will lay hands on the sick , and they will recover . "
they went out , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen .
even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us ,
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
but the angel said to him , " Don 't be afraid , Zacharias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
the angel answered him , " I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
it happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he departed to his house .
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . the virgin 's name was Mary .
having come in , the angel said to her , " Rejoice , you highly favored one ! the Lord is with you . blessed are you among women ! "
behold , you will conceive in your womb , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' Jesus . '
behold , Elizabeth , your relative , also has conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
it happened , when Elizabeth heard Mary 's greeting , that the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
she called out with a loud voice , and said , " Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
for behold , when the voice of your greeting came into my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy !
he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , " His name is John . " they all marveled .
all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , " What then will this child be ? " the hand of the Lord was with him .
Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
she brought forth her firstborn son , and she wrapped him in bands of cloth , and laid him in a feeding trough , because there was no room for them in the inn .
when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon . this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
he came in the Spirit into the temple . when the parents brought in the child , Jesus , that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law ,
and Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary , his mother , " Behold , this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel , and for a sign which is spoken against .
there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher ( she was of a great age , having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity ,
coming up at that very hour , she gave thanks to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem .
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . Joseph and his mother didn 't know it ,
but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day 's journey , and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances .
when they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us this way ? behold , your father and I were anxiously looking for you . "
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene ,
in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
every valley will be filled . every mountain and hill will be brought low . the crooked will become straight , and the rough ways smooth .
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and don 't begin to say among yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones !
he answered them , " He who has two coats , let him give to him who has none . he who has food , let him do likewise . "
John answered them all , " I indeed baptize you with water , but he comes who is mightier than I , the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen . he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire ,
and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him ; and a voice came out of the sky , saying " You are my beloved Son . in you I am well pleased . "
Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
the devil said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . "
Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
the devil said to him , " I will give you all this authority , and their glory , for it has been delivered to me ; and I give it to whomever I want .
Jesus answered him , " Get behind me Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here ,
he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up . he entered , as was his custom , into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . he opened the book , and found the place where it was written ,
he closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
all testified about him , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth , and they said , " isn 't this Joseph 's son ? "
but truly I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the sky was shut up three years and six months , when a great famine came over all the land .
Elijah was sent to none of them , except to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , yet not one of them was cleansed , except Naaman , the Syrian . "
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the cliff .
Jesus rebuked him , saying , " Be silent , and come out of him ! " when the demon had thrown him down in their midst , he came out of him , having done him no harm .
amazement came on all , and they spoke together , one with another , saying , " What is this word ? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! "
he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @-@ in @-@ law was afflicted with a great fever , and they begged him for her .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
demons also came out from many , crying out , and saying , " You are the Christ , the Son of God ! " rebuking them , he didn 't allow them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
when it was day , he departed and went into an uninhabited place , and the multitudes looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wouldn 't go away from them .
now it happened , while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret .
he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon 's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . he sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat .
but Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , " Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . "
he stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately the leprosy left him .
he commanded him to tell no one , " But go your way , and show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus .
the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , " Who is this that speaks blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but God alone ? "
which is easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven you ; ' or to say , ' Arise and walk ? '
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins " ( he said to the paralyzed man ) , " I tell you , arise , and take up your cot , and go to your house . "
amazement took hold on all , and they glorified God . they were filled with fear , saying , " We have seen strange things today . "
after these things he went out , and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office , and said to him , " Follow me ! "
their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , " Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? "
they said to him , " Why do John 's disciples often fast and pray , likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink ? "
he said to them , " Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them . then they will fast in those days . "
he also told a parable to them . " no one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment , or else he will tear the new , and also the piece from the new will not match the old .
now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first , that he was going through the grain fields . his disciples plucked the heads of grain , and ate , rubbing them in their hands .
but some of the Pharisees said to them , " Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? "
Jesus , answering them , said , " Haven 't you read what David did when he was hungry , he , and those who were with him ;
how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? "
but he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man who had the withered hand , " Rise up , and stand in the middle . " he arose and stood .
then Jesus said to them , " I will ask you something : is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? "
he lifted up his eyes to his disciples , and said , " Blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God .
blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall exclude and mock you , and throw out your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake .
rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven , for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets .
woe to you , you who are full now , for you will be hungry . woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
give to everyone who asks you , and don 't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again .
if you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? for even sinners love those who love them .
but love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing back ; and your reward will be great , and you will be children of the Most High ; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil .
Don 't judge , and you won 't be judged . Don 't condemn , and you won 't be condemned . set free , and you will be set free .
" give , and it will be given to you : good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will be given to you . for with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you . "
he spoke a parable to them . " can the blind guide the blind ? won 't they both fall into a pit ?
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don 't gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
but he who hears , and doesn 't do , is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation , against which the stream broke , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house was great . "
a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and at the point of death .
Jesus went with them . when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying to him , " Lord , don 't trouble yourself , for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof .
for I also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers . I tell this one , ' Go ! ' and he goes ; and to another , ' Come ! ' and he comes ; and to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
when Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turned and said to the multitude who followed him , " I tell you , I have not found such great faith , no , not in Israel . "
it happened soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain . many of his disciples , along with a great multitude , went with him .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . many people of the city were with her .
he came near and touched the coffin , and the bearers stood still . he said , " Young man , I tell you , arise ! "
fear took hold of all , and they glorified God , saying , " A great prophet has arisen among us ! " and , " God has visited his people ! "
John , calling to himself two of his disciples , sent them to Jesus , saying , " Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for another ? "
when the men had come to him , they said , " John the Baptizer has sent us to you , saying , ' Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? ' "
when John 's messengers had departed , he began to tell the multitudes about John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man clothed in soft clothing ? behold , those who are gorgeously dressed , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
but what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he of whom it is written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
the Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ' Behold , a gluttonous man , and a drunkard ; a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! '
behold , a woman in the city who was a sinner , when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee 's house , she brought an alabaster jar of ointment .
standing behind at his feet weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and she wiped them with the hair of her head , kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him , that she is a sinner . "
therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . but to whom little is forgiven , the same loves little . "
those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves , " Who is this who even forgives sins ? "
" the farmer went out to sow his seed . as he sowed , some fell along the road , and it was trampled under foot , and the birds of the sky devoured it .
other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
that which fell among the thorns , these are those who have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with cares , riches , and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
be careful therefore how you hear . for whoever has , to him will be given ; and whoever doesn 't have , from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has . "
it was told him by some saying , " Your mother and your brothers stand outside , desiring to see you . "
they came to him , and awoke him , saying , " Master , master , we are dying ! " he awoke , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water , and they ceased , and it was calm .
now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain , and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those . he allowed them .
the demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
people went out to see what had happened . they came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at Jesus ' feet , clothed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
all the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were very much afraid . he entered into the boat , and returned .
it happened , when Jesus returned , that the multitude welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and begged him to come into his house ,
a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living on physicians , and could not be healed by any ,
when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
he said to her , " Daughter , cheer up . your faith has made you well . go in peace . "
while he still spoke , one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house came , saying to him , " Your daughter is dead . Don 't trouble the Teacher . "
when he came to the house , he didn 't allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the child , and her mother .
but he put them all outside , and taking her by the hand , he called , saying , " Child , arise ! "
now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him ; and he was very perplexed , because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead ,
but the multitudes , perceiving it , followed him . he welcomed them , and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God , and he cured those who needed healing .
but he said to them , " You give them something to eat . " they said , " We have no more than five loaves and two fish , unless we should go and buy food for all these people . "
for they were about five thousand men . he said to his disciples , " Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each . "
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he blessed them , and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
they answered , " ' John the Baptizer , ' but others say , ' Elijah , ' and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again . "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world , and loses or forfeits his own self ?
it happened about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up onto the mountain to pray .
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
it happened , as they were parting from him , that Peter said to Jesus , " Master , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah , " not knowing what he said .
it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met him .
while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
they were all astonished at the majesty of God . but while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did , he said to his disciples ,
Jesus , perceiving the reasoning of their hearts , took a little child , and set him by his side ,
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
for the Son of Man didn 't come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
he said to another , " Follow me ! " but he said , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
but Jesus said to him , " Leave the dead to bury their own dead , but you go and announce the Kingdom of God . "
but Jesus said to him , " No one , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the Kingdom of God . "
now after these things , the Lord also appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place , where he was about to come .
heal the sick who are therein , and tell them , ' The Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
'Even the dust from your city that clings to us , we wipe off against you . nevertheless know this , that the Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
" woe to you , Chorazin ! woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
whoever listens to you listens to me , and whoever rejects you rejects me . whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me . "
behold , I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy . nothing will in any way hurt you .
nevertheless , don 't rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
turning to the disciples , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him . "
for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them . "
came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . he set him on his own animal , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
it happened as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
but Martha was distracted with much serving , and she came up to him , and said , " Lord , don 't you care that my sister left me to serve alone ? ask her therefore to help me . "
but one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the good part , which will not be taken away from her . "
forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
and he from within will answer and say , ' Don 't bother me . the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed . I can 't get up and give it to you ' ?
I tell you , although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence , he will get up and give him as many as he needs .
" which of you fathers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won 't give him a snake instead of a fish , will he ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
but some of them said , " He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
the unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
when the multitudes were gathering together to him , he began to say , " This is an evil generation . it seeks after a sign . no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah , the prophet .
for even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will also the Son of Man be to this generation .
" no one , when he has lit a lamp , puts it in a cellar or under a basket , but on a stand , that those who come in may see the light .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
now as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him . he went in , and sat at the table .
the Lord said to him , " Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness .
but give for gifts to the needy those things which are within , and behold , all things will be clean to you .
but woe to you Pharisees ! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb , but you bypass justice and the love of God . you ought to have done these , and not to have left the other undone .
woe to you Pharisees ! for you love the best seats in the synagogues , and the greetings in the marketplaces .
he said , " Woe to you lawyers also ! for you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry , and you yourselves won 't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens .
woe to you ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
lying in wait for him , and seeking to catch him in something he might say , that they might accuse him .
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
but I will warn you whom you should fear . fear him , who after he has killed , has power to cast into Gehenna . yes , I tell you , fear him .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
" I tell you , everyone who confesses me before men , him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God ;
when they bring you before the synagogues , the rulers , and the authorities , don 't be anxious how or what you will answer , or what you will say ;
but he said to him , " Man , who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? "
he spoke a parable to them , saying , " The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly .
he reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don 't have room to store my crops ? '
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
I will tell my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years . take your ease , eat , drink , be merry . " '
" but God said to him , ' You foolish one , tonight your soul is required of you . the things which you have prepared--whose will they be ? '
he said to his disciples , " Therefore I tell you , don 't be anxious for your life , what you will eat , nor yet for your body , what you will wear .
if then you aren 't able to do even the least things , why are you anxious about the rest ?
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith ?
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
the Lord said , " Who then is the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the right times ?
but if that servant says in his heart , ' My lord delays his coming , ' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ,
then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn 't expecting him , and in an hour that he doesn 't know , and will cut him in two , and place his portion with the unfaithful .
but he who didn 't know , and did things worthy of stripes , will be beaten with few stripes . to whomever much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom much was entrusted , of him more will be asked .
but I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
he said to the multitudes also , " When you see a cloud rising from the west , immediately you say , ' A shower is coming , ' and so it happens .
now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans , whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
or those eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way . "
he spoke this parable . " a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it , and found none .
he said to the vine dresser , ' Behold , these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree , and found none . cut it down . why does it waste the soil ? '
if it bears fruit , fine ; but if not , after that , you can cut it down . ' "
when Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , " Woman , you are freed from your infirmity . "
the ruler of the synagogue , being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the multitude , " There are six days in which men ought to work . therefore come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day ! "
therefore the Lord answered him , " You hypocrites ! doesn 't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath , and lead him away to water ?
as he said these things , all his adversaries were disappointed , and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and put in his own garden . it grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches . "
then you will begin to say , ' We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . '
he will say , ' I tell you , I don 't know where you come from . depart from me , all you workers of iniquity . '
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets , in the Kingdom of God , and yourselves being thrown outside .
behold , there are some who are last who will be first , and there are some who are first who will be last . "
on that same day , some Pharisees came , saying to him , " Get out of here , and go away , for Herod wants to kill you . "
he said to them , " Go and tell that fox , ' Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I complete my mission .
" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! how often I wanted to gather your children together , like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings , and you refused !
behold , your house is left to you desolate . I tell you , you will not see me , until you say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
but they were silent . he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
he answered them , " Which of you , if your son or an ox fell into a well , wouldn 't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? "
" when you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast , don 't sit in the best seat , since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him ,
and he who invited both of you would come and tell you , ' Make room for this person . ' then you would begin , with shame , to take the lowest place .
but when you make a feast , ask the poor , the maimed , the lame , or the blind ;
but he said to him , " A certain man made a great supper , and he invited many people .
he sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited , ' Come , for everything is ready now . '
they all as one began to make excuses . " the first said to him , ' I have bought a field , and I must go and see it . please have me excused . '
" another said , ' I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I must go try them out . please have me excused . '
" that servant came , and told his lord these things . then the master of the house , being angry , said to his servant , ' Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in the poor , maimed , blind , and lame . '
or perhaps , when he has laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , everyone who sees begins to mock him ,
or what king , as he goes to encounter another king in war , will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
" which of you men , if you had one hundred sheep , and lost one of them , wouldn 't leave the ninety @-@ nine in the wilderness , and go after the one that was lost , until he found it ?
when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ' Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! '
or what woman , if she had ten drachma coins , if she lost one drachma coin , wouldn 't light a lamp , sweep the house , and seek diligently until she found it ?
even so , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting . "
the younger of them said to his father , ' Father , give me my share of your property . ' he divided his livelihood between them .
not many days after , the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country . there he wasted his property with riotous living .
when he had spent all of it , there arose a severe famine in that country , and he began to be in need .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
" he arose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
" but the father said to his servants , ' Bring out the best robe , and put it on him . put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet .
he also said to his disciples , " There was a certain rich man who had a manager . an accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions .
he called him , and said to him , ' What is this that I hear about you ? give an accounting of your management , for you can no longer be manager . '
calling each one of his lord 's debtors to him , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my lord ? '
he said , ' A hundred batos of oil . ' he said to him , ' Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . '
I tell you , make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon , so that when you fail , they may receive you into the eternal tents .
if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
no servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . you aren 't able to serve God and mammon . "
he said to them , " You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts . for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man 's table . yes , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
he cried and said , ' Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ! for I am in anguish in this flame . '
" but Abraham said , ' Son , remember that you , in your lifetime , received your good things , and Lazarus , in the same way , bad things . but now here he is comforted and you are in anguish .
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
for I have five brothers , that he may testify to them , so they won 't also come into this place of torment . '
" he said to him , ' If they don 't listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead . ' "
he said to the disciples , " It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come , but woe to him through whom they come !
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
the Lord said , " If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed , you would tell this sycamore tree , ' Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
but who is there among you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
even so you also , when you have done all the things that are commanded you , say , ' We are unworthy servants . we have done our duty . ' "
he fell on his face at Jesus ' feet , giving him thanks ; and he was a Samaritan .
being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come , he answered them , " The Kingdom of God doesn 't come with observation ;
neither will they say , ' Look , here ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' for behold , the Kingdom of God is within you . "
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he who will be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
won 't God avenge his chosen ones , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
I tell you that he will avenge them quickly . nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
but the tax collector , standing far away , wouldn 't even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! '
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
Jesus summoned them , saying , " Allow the little children to come to me , and don 't hinder them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
when Jesus heard these things , he said to him , " You still lack one thing . sell all that you have , and distribute it to the poor . you will have treasure in heaven . come , follow me . "
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there is no one who has left house , or wife , or brothers , or parents , or children , for the Kingdom of God 's sake ,
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
there was a man named Zacchaeus . he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and saw him , and said to him , " Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . "
when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , " Behold , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor . if I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone , I restore four times as much . "
as they heard these things , he went on and told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately .
but his citizens hated him , and sent an envoy after him , saying , ' We don 't want this man to reign over us . '
" he said to him , ' Well done , you good servant ! because you were found faithful with very little , you shall have authority over ten cities . '
for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . you take up that which you didn 't lay down , and reap that which you didn 't sow . '
" he said to him , ' Out of your own mouth will I judge you , you wicked servant ! you knew that I am an exacting man , taking up that which I didn 't lay down , and reaping that which I didn 't sow .
it happened , when he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany , at the mountain that is called Olivet , he sent two of his disciples ,
saying , " Go your way into the village on the other side , in which , as you enter , you will find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat . untie it , and bring it .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you untying it ? ' say to him : ' the Lord needs it . ' "
as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
saying , " Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! peace in heaven , and glory in the highest ! "
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn 't know the time of your visitation . "
he was teaching daily in the temple , but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him .
they asked him , " Tell us : by what authority do you do these things ? or who is giving you this authority ? "
he began to tell the people this parable . " a man planted a vineyard , and rented it out to some farmers , and went into another country for a long time .
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
they threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
but he looked at them , and said , " Then what is this that is written , ' The stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the chief cornerstone ? '
they watched him , and sent out spies , who pretended to be righteous , that they might trap him in something he said , so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor .
they weren 't able to trap him in his words before the people . they marveled at his answer , and were silent .
they asked him , " Teacher , Moses wrote to us that if a man 's brother dies having a wife , and he is childless , his brother should take the wife , and raise up children for his brother .
for they can 't die any more , for they are like the angels , and are children of God , being children of the resurrection .
now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for all are alive to him . "
David himself says in the book of Psalms , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand ,
" beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the marketplaces , the best seats in the synagogues , and the best places at feasts ;
for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , put in all that she had to live on . "
they asked him , " Teacher , so when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are about to happen ? "
he said , " Watch out that you don 't get led astray , for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' therefore don 't follow them .
when you hear of wars and disturbances , don 't be terrified , for these things must happen first , but the end won 't come immediately . "
but before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you up to synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name 's sake .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days ! for there will be great distress in the land , and wrath to this people .
they will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations . Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
there will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars ; and on the earth anxiety of nations , in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves ;
but when these things begin to happen , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is near . "
" so be careful , or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing , drunkenness , and cares of this life , and that day will come on you suddenly .
the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death , for they feared the people .
he sent Peter and John , saying , " Go and prepare the Passover for us , that we may eat . "
tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says to you , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? " '
for I tell you , I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine , until the Kingdom of God comes . "
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
likewise , he took the cup after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
the Son of Man indeed goes , as it has been determined , but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! "
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom . you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
for I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me : ' he was counted with transgressors . ' for that which concerns me has an end . "
they said , " Lord , behold , here are two swords . " he said to them , " That is enough . "
he came out , and went , as his custom was , to the Mount of Olives . his disciples also followed him .
when he was at the place , he said to them , " Pray that you don 't enter into temptation . "
when he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
Jesus said to the chief priests , captains of the temple , and elders , who had come against him , " Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
when I was with you in the temple daily , you didn 't stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
a certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light , and looking intently at him , said , " This man also was with him . "
after a little while someone else saw him , and said , " You also are one of them ! " but Peter answered , " Man , I am not ! "
after about one hour passed , another confidently affirmed , saying , " Truly this man also was with him , for he is a Galilean ! "
but Peter said , " Man , I don 't know what you are talking about ! " immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
they began to accuse him , saying , " We found this man perverting the nation , forbidding paying taxes to Caesar , and saying that he himself is Christ , a king . "
Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he answered him , " So you say . "
now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some miracle done by him .
he said to them the third time , " Why ? what evil has this man done ? I have found no capital crime in him . I will therefore chastise him and release him . "
but they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed .
he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus up to their will .
for if they do these things in the green tree , what will be done in the dry ? "
Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they don 't know what they are doing . " dividing his garments among them , they cast lots .
the people stood watching . the rulers with them also scoffed at him , saying , " He saved others . let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! "
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
one of the criminals who was hanged insulted him , saying , " If you are the Christ , save yourself and us ! "
Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , " Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! " having said this , he breathed his last .
when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , " Certainly this was a righteous man . "
all the multitudes that came together to see this , when they saw the things that were done , returned home beating their breasts .
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
the women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
but Peter got up and ran to the tomb . stooping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
he said to them , " What things ? " they said to him , " The things concerning Jesus , the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
they urged him , saying , " Stay with us , for it is almost evening , and the day is almost over . " he went in to stay with them .
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
but they were terrified and filled with fear , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
he said to them , " This is what I told you , while I was still with you , that all things which are written in the law of Moses , the prophets , and the psalms , concerning me must be fulfilled . "
he said to them , " Thus it is written , and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day ,
behold , I send forth the promise of my Father on you . but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high . "
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
the same came as a witness , that he might testify about the light , that all might believe through him .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
this is John 's testimony , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , " Who are you ? "
the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
I didn 't know him , but for this reason I came baptizing in water : that he would be revealed to Israel . "
he said to them , " Come , and see . " they came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . it was about the tenth hour .
he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said , " You are Simon the son of Jonah . you shall be called Cephas " ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) .
on the next day , he was determined to go out into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
Philip found Nathanael , and said to him , " We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote : Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . "
Nathanael said to him , " Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . "
Nathanael said to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
Nathanael answered him , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! you are King of Israel ! "
Jesus answered him , " Because I told you , ' I saw you underneath the fig tree , ' do you believe ? you will see greater things than these ! "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine , and didn 't know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom ,
and said to him , " Everyone serves the good wine first , and when the guests have drunk freely , then that which is worse . you have kept the good wine until now ! "
he made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables .
the Jews therefore said , " It took forty @-@ six years to build this temple ! will you raise it up in three days ? "
Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
the wind blows where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don 't know where it comes from and where it is going . so is everyone who is born of the Spirit . "
no one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
after these things , Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea . he stayed there with them , and baptized .
he who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice . this , my joy , therefore is made full .
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
one who believes in the Son has eternal life , but one who disobeys the Son won 't see life , but the wrath of God remains on him . "
so he came to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son , Joseph .
Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being tired from his journey , sat down by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
a woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink . "
Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who says to you , ' Give me a drink , ' you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . "
the woman said to him , " Sir , you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . from where then have you that living water ?
are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his children , and his livestock ? "
the woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I don 't get thirsty , neither come all the way here to draw . "
but the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers .
Jesus said to her , " I am he , the one who speaks to you . "
at this , his disciples came . they marveled that he was speaking with a woman ; yet no one said , " What are you looking for ? " or , " Why do you speak with her ? "
so the woman left her water pot , and went away into the city , and said to the people ,
the disciples therefore said one to another , " Has anyone brought him something to eat ? "
he who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit to eternal life ; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
from that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman , who testified , " He told me everything that I did . "
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus therefore said to him , " Unless you see signs and wonders , you will in no way believe . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool , and stirred up the water . whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had .
when Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been sick for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to be made well ? "
immediately , the man was made well , and took up his mat and walked . now it was the Sabbath on that day .
afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , " Behold , you are made well . sin no more , so that nothing worse happens to you . "
but Jesus answered them , " My Father is still working , so I am working , too . "
for this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
for as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires .
that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . he who doesn 't honor the Son doesn 't honor the Father who sent him .
" most certainly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and doesn 't come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don 't seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
but the testimony which I have is greater than that of John , for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish , the very works that I do , testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
" you search the Scriptures , because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and these are they which testify about me .
" Don 't think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
" there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish , but what are these among so many ? "
Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " now there was much grass in that place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did , they said , " This is truly the prophet who comes into the world . "
Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had rowed about twenty @-@ five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat . immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
when they found him on the other side of the sea , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you come here ? "
Don 't work for the food which perishes , but for the food which remains to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . for God the Father has sealed him . "
they said therefore to him , " What then do you do for a sign , that we may see , and believe you ? what work do you do ?
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , it wasn 't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
for the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . "
Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thirsty .
this is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
they said , " isn 't this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how then does he say , ' I have come down out of heaven ? ' "
it is written in the prophets , ' They will all be taught by God . ' therefore everyone who hears from the Father , and has learned , comes to me .
this is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that anyone may eat of it and not die .
the Jews therefore contended with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
therefore many of his disciples , when they heard this , said , " This is a hard saying ! who can listen to it ? "
it is the spirit who gives life . the flesh profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
we have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
now he spoke of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , for it was he who would betray him , being one of the twelve .
his brothers therefore said to him , " Depart from here , and go into Judea , that your disciples also may see your works which you do .
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him . some said , " He is a good man . " others said , " Not so , but he leads the multitude astray . "
the Jews therefore marveled , saying , " How does this man know letters , having never been educated ? "
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
if a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing to him . can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ ?
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , " You both know me , and know where I am from . I have not come of myself , but he who sent me is true , whom you don 't know .
the Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
then Jesus said , " I will be with you a little while longer , then I go to him who sent me .
now on the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , " If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me and drink !
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , " Why didn 't you bring him ? "
now very early in the morning , he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him . he sat down , and taught them .
now in our law , Moses commanded us to stone such . what then do you say about her ? "
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
she said , " No one , Lord . " Jesus said , " Neither do I condemn you . go your way . from now on , sin no more . "
again , therefore , Jesus spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . he who follows me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the light of life . "
Jesus answered them , " Even if I testify about myself , my testimony is true , for I know where I came from , and where I am going ; but you don 't know where I came from , or where I am going .
Jesus said therefore again to them , " I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sins . where I go , you can 't come . "
he said to them , " You are from beneath . I am from above . you are of this world . I am not of this world .
they said therefore to him , " Who are you ? " Jesus said to them , " Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning .
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
he who sent me is with me . the Father hasn 't left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . "
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
they answered him , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus said to them , " If you were Abraham 's children , you would do the works of Abraham .
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn 't do this .
you do the works of your father . " they said to him , " We were not born of sexual immorality . we have one Father , God . "
then the Jews said to him , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and you say , ' If a man keeps my word , he will never taste of death . '
are you greater than our father , Abraham , who died ? the prophets died . who do you make yourself out to be ? "
you have not known him , but I know him . if I said , ' I don 't know him , ' I would be like you , a liar . but I know him , and keep his word .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( which means " Sent " ) . so he went away , washed , and came back seeing .
he answered , " A man called Jesus made mud , anointed my eyes , and said to me , ' Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash . ' so I went away and washed , and I received sight . "
again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . he said to them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and I see . "
some therefore of the Pharisees said , " This man is not from God , because he doesn 't keep the Sabbath . " others said , " How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? " there was division among them .
therefore they asked the blind man again , " What do you say about him , because he opened your eyes ? " he said , " He is a prophet . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
so they called the man who was blind a second time , and said to him , " Give glory to God . we know that this man is a sinner . "
he therefore answered , " I don 't know if he is a sinner . one thing I do know : that though I was blind , now I see . "
they said to him again , " What did he do to you ? how did he open your eyes ? "
he answered them , " I told you already , and you didn 't listen . why do you want to hear it again ? you don 't also want to become his disciples , do you ? "
we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
Jesus said to him , " You have both seen him , and it is he who speaks with you . "
Jesus said , " I came into this world for judgment , that those who don 't see may see ; and that those who see may become blind . "
the gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don 't know the voice of strangers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
he who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who doesn 't own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and flees . the wolf snatches the sheep , and scatters them .
the hired hand flees because he is a hired hand , and doesn 't care for the sheep .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
the Jews therefore came around him and said to him , " How long will you hold us in suspense ? if you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
but if I do them , though you don 't believe me , believe the works ; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . "
but when Jesus heard it , he said , " This sickness is not to death , but for the glory of God , that God 's Son may be glorified by it . "
Jesus answered , " aren 't there twelve hours of daylight ? if a man walks in the day , he doesn 't stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
but if a man walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light isn 't in him . "
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe . nevertheless , let 's go to him . "
Martha said to him , " I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . "
Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . he who believes in me will still live , even if he dies .
she said to him , " Yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you are the Christ , God 's Son , he who comes into the world . "
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and said , " Where have you laid him ? " they told him , " Lord , come and see . "
some of them said , " couldn 't this man , who opened the eyes of him who was blind , have also kept this man from dying ? "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
the chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , " What are we doing ? for this man does many signs .
if we leave him alone like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . "
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . "
now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
then six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
so they made him a supper there . Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
for you always have the poor with you , but you don 't always have me . "
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
" Don 't be afraid , daughter of Zion . behold , your King comes , sitting on a donkey 's colt . "
his disciples didn 't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying about it .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
these , therefore , came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
" now my soul is troubled . what shall I say ? ' father , save me from this time ? ' but for this cause I came to this time .
the multitude therefore , who stood by and heard it , said that it had thundered . others said , " An angel has spoken to him . "
now is the judgment of this world . now the prince of this world will be cast out .
the multitude answered him , " We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever . how do you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ? ' who is this Son of Man ? "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Yet a little while the light is with you . walk while you have the light , that darkness doesn 't overtake you . he who walks in the darkness doesn 't know where he is going .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
" he has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart , lest they should see with their eyes , and perceive with their heart , and would turn , and I would heal them . "
nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they didn 't confess it , so that they wouldn 't be put out of the synagogue ,
I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness .
if anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn 't believe , I don 't judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and doesn 't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
I know that his commandment is eternal life . the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father has said to me , so I speak . "
now before the feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ,
arose from supper , and laid aside his outer garments . he took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
Peter said to him , " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " If I don 't wash you , you have no part with me . "
Jesus said to him , " Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed , but is completely clean . you are clean , but not all of you . "
for he knew him who would betray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
you call me , ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' you say so correctly , for so I am .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
most certainly I tell you , he who receives whomever I send , receives me ; and he who receives me , receives him who sent me . "
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , and said to him , " Tell us who it is of whom he speaks . "
after the piece of bread , then Satan entered into him . then Jesus said to him , " What you do , do quickly . "
for some thought , because Judas had the money box , that Jesus said to him , " Buy what things we need for the feast , " or that he should give something to the poor .
when he had gone out , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
a new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
Jesus answered him , " Will you lay down your life for me ? most certainly I tell you , the rooster won 't crow until you have denied me three times .
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it weren 't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
Jesus said to him , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . no one comes to the Father , except through me .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
Philip said to him , " Lord , show us the Father , and that will be enough for us . "
Jesus said to him , " Have I been with you such a long time , and do you not know me , Philip ? he who has seen me has seen the Father . how do you say , ' Show us the Father ? '
Don 't you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father who lives in me does his works .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
I will pray to the Father , and he will give you another Counselor , that he may be with you forever , --
the Spirit of truth , whom the world can 't receive ; for it doesn 't see him , neither knows him . you know him , for he lives with you , and will be in you .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
he who doesn 't love me doesn 't keep my words . the word which you hear isn 't mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
but the Counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and will remind you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don 't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father commanded me , even so I do . arise , let us go from here .
if a man doesn 't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
" in this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
if you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and remain in his love .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
no longer do I call you servants , for the servant doesn 't know what his lord does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
you didn 't choose me , but I chose you , and appointed you , that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain ; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
remember the word that I said to you : ' a servant is not greater than his lord . ' if they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . if they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
" when the Counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn 't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
but now I am going to him who sent me , and none of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don 't go away , the Counselor won 't come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
however when he , the Spirit of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he hears , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
most certainly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
a woman , when she gives birth , has sorrow , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she doesn 't remember the anguish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
until now , you have asked nothing in my name . ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don 't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
behold , the time is coming , yes , and has now come , that you will be scattered , everyone to his own place , and you will leave me alone . yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
I have told you these things , that in me you may have peace . in the world you have oppression ; but cheer up ! I have overcome the world . "
Jesus said these things , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , " Father , the time has come . glorify your Son , that your Son may also glorify you ;
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . they were yours , and you have given them to me . they have kept your word .
I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
the glory which you have given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
I in them , and you in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may know that you sent me , and loved them , even as you loved me .
I made known to them your name , and will make it known ; that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them . "
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron , where there was a garden , into which he and his disciples entered .
Judas then , having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , came there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
they answered him , " Jesus of Nazareth . " Jesus said to them , " I am he . " Judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
Jesus therefore said to Peter , " Put the sword into its sheath . the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not surely drink it ? "
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
Jesus answered him , " I spoke openly to the world . I always taught in synagogues , and in the temple , where the Jews always meet . I said nothing in secret .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
when he had said this , one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand , saying , " Do you answer the high priest like that ? "
one of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " didn 't I see you in the garden with him ? "
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
Pilate therefore went out to them , and said , " What accusation do you bring against this man ? "
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium , called Jesus , and said to him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? "
Pilate therefore said to him , " Are you a king then ? " Jesus answered , " You say that I am a king . for this reason I have been born , and for this reason I have come into the world , that I should testify to the truth . everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice . "
Pilate said to him , " What is truth ? " when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and said to them , " I find no basis for a charge against him .
but you have a custom , that I should release someone to you at the Passover . therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " Behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . Pilate said to them , " Behold , the man ! "
when therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him , they shouted , saying , " Crucify ! crucify ! " Pilate said to them , " Take him yourselves , and crucify him , for I find no basis for a charge against him . "
the Jews answered him , " We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
he entered into the Praetorium again , and said to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " but Jesus gave him no answer .
Pilate therefore said to him , " aren 't you speaking to me ? Don 't you know that I have power to release you , and have power to crucify you ? "
at this , Pilate was seeking to release him , but the Jews cried out , saying , " If you release this man , you aren 't Caesar 's friend ! everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar ! "
when Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
they cried out , " Away with him ! away with him ! crucify him ! " Pilate said to them , " Shall I crucify your King ? " the chief priests answered , " We have no king but Caesar ! "
Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " JESUS OF Nazareth , THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
then he said to the disciple , " Behold , your mother ! " from that hour , the disciple took her to his own home .
after this , Jesus , seeing that all things were now finished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , " I am thirsty . "
now a vessel full of vinegar was set there ; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop , and held it at his mouth .
he who has seen has testified , and his testimony is true . he knows that he tells the truth , that you may believe .
after these things , Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus ' body . Pilate gave him permission . he came therefore and took away his body .
now on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene went early , while it was still dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
they told her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? " she said to them , " Because they have taken away my Lord , and I don 't know where they have laid him . "
Jesus said to her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? who are you looking for ? " she , supposing him to be the gardener , said to him , " Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him , and I will take him away . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
Jesus therefore said to them again , " Peace be to you . as the Father has sent me , even so I send you . "
after eight days again his disciples were inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , the doors being locked , and stood in the midst , and said , " Peace be to you . "
then he said to Thomas , " Reach here your finger , and see my hands . reach here your hand , and put it into my side . Don 't be unbelieving , but believing . "
Simon Peter said to them , " I 'm going fishing . " they told him , " We are also coming with you . " they immediately went out , and entered into the boat . that night , they caught nothing .
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @-@ three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn 't torn .
Jesus said to them , " Come and eat breakfast . " none of the disciples dared inquire of him , " Who are you ? " knowing that it was the Lord .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
now he said this , signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . when he had said this , he said to him , " Follow me . "
then Peter , turning around , saw a disciple following . this was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved , the one who had also leaned on Jesus ' breast at the supper and asked , " Lord , who is going to betray You ? "
this saying therefore went out among the brothers , that this disciple wouldn 't die . yet Jesus didn 't say to him that he wouldn 't die , but , " If I desire that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? "
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn 't have room for the books that would be written .
until the day in which he was received up , after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen .
he said to them , " It isn 't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
who also said , " You men of Galilee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? this Jesus , who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky . "
when they had come in , they went up into the upper room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew , Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness , and falling headlong , his body burst open , and all his intestines gushed out .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
beginning from the baptism of John , to the day that he was received up from us , of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection . "
they prayed , and said , " You , Lord , who know the hearts of all men , show which one of these two you have chosen
to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away , that he might go to his own place . "
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
they were all amazed , and were perplexed , saying one to another , " What does this mean ? "
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and spoke out to them , " You men of Judea , and all you who dwell at Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and listen to my words .
for these aren 't drunken , as you suppose , seeing it is only the third hour of the day .
yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
I will show wonders in the sky above , and signs on the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and billows of smoke .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
him , being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God , you have taken by the hand of lawless men , crucified and killed ;
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
because you will not leave my soul in Hades , neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay .
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
" let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you crucified . "
Peter said to them , " Repent , and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
day by day , continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread at home , they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart ,
praising God , and having favor with all the people . the Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved .
a certain man who was lame from his mother 's womb was being carried , whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful , to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple .
but Peter said , " Silver and gold have I none , but what I have , that I give you . in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up and walk ! "
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his Servant Jesus , whom you delivered up , and denied in the presence of Pilate , when he had determined to release him .
by faith in his name , his name has made this man strong , whom you see and know . yes , the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
for Moses indeed said to the fathers , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
but many of those who heard the word believed , and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
it happened in the morning , that their rulers , elders , and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem .
be it known to you all , and to all the people of Israel , that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , in him does this man stand here before you whole .
he is ' the stone which was regarded as worthless by you , the builders , which has become the head of the corner . '
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , " What shall we do to these men ? because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them , as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem , and we can 't deny it .
but so that this spreads no further among the people , let 's threaten them , that from now on they don 't speak to anyone in this name . "
but Peter and John answered them , " Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves ,
when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for everyone glorified God for that which was done .
" for truly , in this city against your holy servant , Jesus , whom you anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , were gathered together
while you stretch out your hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus . "
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul . not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own , but they had all things in common .
and laid them at the apostles ' feet , and distribution was made to each , according as anyone had need .
but Peter said , " Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
Peter answered her , " Tell me whether you sold the land for so much . " she said , " Yes , for so much . "
she fell down immediately at his feet , and died . the young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her by her husband .
multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem , bringing sick people , and those who were tormented by unclean spirits : and they were all healed .
but an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night , and brought them out , and said ,
saying , " didn 't we strictly command you not to teach in this name ? behold , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and intend to bring this man 's blood on us . "
God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and remission of sins .
after this man , Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some people after him . he also perished , and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
but if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow it , and you would be found even to be fighting against God ! "
they agreed with him . summoning the apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus ' name .
now in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplying , a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily service .
the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said , " It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables .
therefore select from among you , brothers , seven men of good report , full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly . a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us . "
he said , " Brothers and fathers , listen . the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
God spoke in this way : that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
he gave him the covenant of circumcision . so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day . Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs .
and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem .
the same took advantage of our race , and mistreated our fathers , and forced them to throw out their babies , so that they wouldn 't stay alive .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sirs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
but he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
Moses fled at this saying , and became a stranger in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
'i am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ' Moses trembled , and dared not look .
I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their groaning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
" this Moses , whom they refused , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ' --God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
they made a calf in those days , and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their hands .
but God turned , and gave them up to serve the army of the sky , as it is written in the book of the prophets , ' Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
who found favor in the sight of God , and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob .
'heaven is my throne , and the earth a footstool for my feet . what kind of house will you build me ? ' says the Lord ; ' or what is the place of my rest ?
which of the prophets didn 't your fathers persecute ? they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One , of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers .
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
Saul was consenting to his death . a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except for the apostles .
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
but there was a certain man , Simon by name , who used to practice sorcery in the city , and amazed the people of Samaria , making himself out to be some great one ,
but when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
who , when they had come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ;
now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ' hands , he offered them money ,
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans .
but an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " Arise , and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . this is a desert . "
he arose and went ; and behold , there was a man of Ethiopia , a eunuch of great authority under Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jerusalem to worship .
Philip ran to him , and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and said , " Do you understand what you are reading ? "
in his humiliation , his judgment was taken away . who will declare His generation ? for his life is taken from the earth . "
he commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
but Philip was found at Azotus . passing through , he preached the Good News to all the cities , until he came to Caesarea .
but Saul , still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus , that if he found any who were of the Way , whether men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
as he traveled , it happened that he got close to Damascus , and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him .
he fell on the earth , and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? "
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias . the Lord said to him in a vision , " Ananias ! " he said , " Behold , it 's me , Lord . "
the Lord said to him , " Arise , and go to the street which is called Straight , and inquire in the house of Judah for one named Saul , a man of Tarsus . for behold , he is praying ,
and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight . "
but the Lord said to him , " Go your way , for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings , and the children of Israel .
Ananias departed , and entered into the house . laying his hands on him , he said , " Brother Saul , the Lord , who appeared to you on the road by which you came , has sent me , that you may receive your sight , and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
when Saul had come to Jerusalem , he tried to join himself to the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
but Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus .
when the brothers knew it , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him off to Tarsus .
so the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened , as Peter went throughout all those parts , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which when translated , means dorcas . this woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did .
Peter put them all out , and kneeled down and prayed . turning to the body , he said , " Tabitha , get up ! " she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
at about the ninth hour of the day , he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him , and saying to him , " Cornelius ! "
he , fastening his eyes on him , and being frightened , said , " What is it , Lord ? " he said to him , " Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God .
he lodges with one Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the seaside . "
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon .
now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
on the next day they entered into Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
when it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell down at his feet , and worshiped him .
Cornelius said , " Four days ago , I was fasting until this hour , and at the ninth hour , I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
therefore I sent to you at once , and it was good of you to come . now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God . "
the word which he sent to the children of Israel , preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--
you yourselves know what happened , which was proclaimed throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ;
even Jesus of Nazareth , how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power , who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
all the prophets testify about him , that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins . "
now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
" I was in the city of Joppa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision : a certain container descending , like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners . it came as far as me .
but a voice answered me the second time out of heaven , ' What God has cleansed , don 't you call unclean . '
I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ' John indeed baptized in water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit . '
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
but there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they had come to Antioch , spoke to the Hellenists , preaching the Lord Jesus .
for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith , and many people were added to the Lord .
Peter therefore was kept in the prison , but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him .
the same night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . guards in front of the door kept the prison .
and behold , an angel of the Lord stood by him , and a light shone in the cell . he struck Peter on the side , and woke him up , saying , " Stand up quickly ! " his chains fell off from his hands .
the angel said to him , " Get dressed and put on your sandals . " he did so . he said to him , " Put on your cloak , and follow me . "
and he went out and followed him . he didn 't know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
when Peter had come to himself , he said , " Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod , and from everything the Jewish people were expecting . "
thinking about that , he came to the house of Mary , the mother of John whose surname was Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
but he , beckoning to them with his hand to be silent , declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . he said , " Tell these things to James , and to the brothers . " then he departed , and went to another place .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter .
when Herod had sought for him , and didn 't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
as they served the Lord and fasted , the Holy Spirit said , " Separate Barnabas and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
so , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia . from there they sailed to Cyprus .
who was with the Proconsul , Sergius PAULUS , a man of understanding . this man summoned Barnabas and Saul , and sought to hear the word of God .
and said , " Full of all deceit and all cunning , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
but they , passing on from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , speak . "
Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , " Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen .
when he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king , to whom he also testified , ' I have found David the son of Jesse , a man after my heart , who will do all my will . '
as John was fulfilling his course , he said , ' What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . but behold , one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . '
brothers , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , the word of this salvation is sent out to you .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things , from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses .
'Behold , you scoffers , and wonder , and perish ; for I work a work in your days , a work which you will in no way believe , if one declares it to you . ' "
so when the Jews went out of the synagogue , the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
as the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of God . as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their borders .
it happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
therefore they stayed there a long time , speaking boldly in the Lord , who testified to the word of his grace , granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
said with a loud voice , " Stand upright on your feet ! " he leaped up and walked .
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Lycaonia , " The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! "
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes .
yet he didn 't leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . "
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
when they had preached the Good News to that city , and had made many disciples , they returned to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch ,
confirming the souls of the disciples , exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
from there they sailed to Antioch , from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them , they appointed Paul and Barnabas , and some others of them , to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question .
they , being sent on their way by the assembly , passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles . they caused great joy to all the brothers .
when there had been much discussion , Peter rose up and said to them , " Brothers , you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News , and believe .
God , who knows the heart , testified about them , giving them the Holy Spirit , just like he did to us .
now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
'After these things I will return . I will again build the tabernacle of David , which has fallen . I will again build its ruins . I will set it up ,
that the rest of men may seek after the Lord ; All the Gentiles who are called by my name , Says the Lord , who does all these things .
they wrote these things by their hand : " the apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : greetings .
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your souls , saying , ' You must be circumcised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no commandment ;
it seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
we have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
for it seemed good to the Holy Spirit , and to us , to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things :
after they had spent some time there , they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles .
after some days Paul said to Barnabas , " Let 's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
he came to Derbe and Lystra : and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewess who believed ; but his father was a Greek .
when they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
when they had come opposite Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit didn 't allow them .
a vision appeared to Paul in the night . there was a man of Macedonia standing , begging him , and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
and from there to Philippi , which is a city of Macedonia , the foremost of the district , a Roman colony . we were staying some days in this city .
on the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira , one who worshiped God , heard us ; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul .
when she and her household were baptized , she begged us , saying , " If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and stay . " so she persuaded us .
she was doing this for many days . but Paul , becoming greatly annoyed , turned and said to the spirit , " I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! " it came out that very hour .
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
when they had brought them to the magistrates , they said , " These men , being Jews , are agitating our city ,
the multitude rose up together against them , and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them , and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
who , having received such a command , threw them into the inner prison , and secured their feet in the stocks .
but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them .
suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone 's bonds were loosened .
the jailer , being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
but when it was day , the magistrates sent the sergeants , saying , " Let those men go . "
and they came and begged them . when they had brought them out , they asked them to depart from the city .
they went out of the prison , and entered into Lydia 's house . when they had seen the brothers , they encouraged them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
Paul , as was his custom , went in to them , and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , " This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . "
but the unpersuaded Jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace , and gathering a crowd , set the city in an uproar . assaulting the house of Jason , they sought to bring them out to the people .
whom Jason has received . these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus ! "
but those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens . receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly , they departed .
now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols .
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with those who met him .
they took hold of him , and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , " May we know what this new teaching is , which is spoken by you ?
Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus , and said , " You men of Athens , I perceive that you are very religious in all things .
the God who made the world and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , doesn 't dwell in temples made with hands ,
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwellings ,
'For in him we live , and move , and have our being . ' as some of your own poets have said , ' For we are also his offspring . '
when they opposed him and blasphemed , he shook out his clothing and said to them , " Your blood be on your own heads ! I am clean . from now on , I will go to the Gentiles ! "
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinthians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
but when Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , " If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime , you Jews , it would be reasonable that I should bear with you ;
but if they are questions about words and names and your own law , look to it yourselves . for I don 't want to be a judge of these matters . "
then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn 't care about any of these things .
Paul , having stayed after this many more days , took his leave of the brothers , and sailed from there for Syria , together with Priscilla and Aquila . he shaved his head in Cenchreae , for he had a vow .
he came to Ephesus , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of Galatia , and Phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
now a certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by race , an eloquent man , came to Ephesus . he was mighty in the Scriptures .
when he had determined to pass over into Achaia , the brothers encouraged him , and wrote to the disciples to receive him . when he had come , he greatly helped those who had believed through grace ;
it happened that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul , having passed through the upper country , came to Ephesus , and found certain disciples .
he said to them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " they said to him , " No , we haven 't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . "
this became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived at Ephesus . fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen ,
whom he gathered together , with the workmen of like occupation , and said , " Sirs , you know that by this business we have our wealth .
not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing , and her majesty destroyed , whom all Asia and the world worships . "
they brought Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . Alexander beckoned with his hand , and would have made a defense to the people .
but when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
when he had gone through those parts , and had encouraged them with many words , he came into Greece .
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for he had so arranged , intending himself to go by land .
for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
serving the Lord with all humility , with many tears , and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews ;
but these things don 't count ; nor do I hold my life dear to myself , so that I may finish my race with joy , and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God .
take heed , therefore , to yourselves , and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood .
in all things I gave you an example , that so laboring you ought to help the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he himself said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . ' "
sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him to the ship .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
then Paul answered , " What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? for I am ready not only to be bound , but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . "
but concerning the Gentiles who believe , we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing , except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols , from blood , from strangled things , and from sexual immorality . "
then Paul took the men , and the next day , purified himself and went with them into the temple , declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification , until the offering was offered for every one of them .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
for they had seen Trophimus , the Ephesian , with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
immediately he took soldiers and centurions , and ran down to them . they , when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
then the commanding officer came near , arrested him , commanded him to be bound with two chains , and inquired who he was and what he had done .
some shouted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he couldn 't find out the truth because of the noise , he commanded him to be brought into the barracks .
when he came to the stairs , it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ;
as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he asked the commanding officer , " May I speak to you ? " he said , " Do you know Greek ?
aren 't you then the Egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins ? "
when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , beckoned with his hand to the people . when there was a great silence , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying ,
as also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify , from whom also I received letters to the brothers , and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished .
I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '
I answered , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' he said to me , ' I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute . '
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn 't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
I said , ' What shall I do , Lord ? ' the Lord said to me , ' Arise , and go into Damascus . there you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do . '
when I couldn 't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus ,
came to me , and standing by me said to me , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ' in that very hour I looked up at him .
he said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
now why do you wait ? arise , be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on the name of the Lord . '
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " rid the earth of this fellow , for he isn 't fit to live ! "
when the centurion heard it , he went to the commanding officer and told him , " Watch what you are about to do , for this man is a Roman ! "
the commanding officer answered , " I bought my citizenship for a great price . " Paul said , " But I was born a Roman . "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
but on the next day , desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews , he freed him from the bonds , and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together , and brought Paul down and set him before them .
then Paul said to him , " God will strike you , you whitewashed wall ! do you sit to judge me according to the law , and command me to be struck contrary to the law ? "
but when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , " Men and brothers , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees . concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged ! "
a great clamor arose , and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up , and contended , saying , " We find no evil in this man . but if a spirit or angel has spoken to him , let 's not fight against God ! "
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
the following night , the Lord stood by him , and said , " Cheer up , Paul , for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem , so you must testify also at Rome . "
they came to the chief priests and the elders , and said , " We have bound ourselves under a great curse , to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
but Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul .
Paul summoned one of the centurions , and said , " Bring this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to tell him . "
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
the commanding officer took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
therefore don 't yield to them , for more than forty men lie in wait for him , who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him . now they are ready , looking for the promise from you . "
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
" I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive . " he commanded that he be kept in Herod 's palace .
after five days , the high priest , Ananias , came down with certain elders and an orator , one Tertullus . they informed the governor against Paul .
we accept it in all ways and in all places , most excellent Felix , with all thankfulness .
when the governor had beckoned to him to speak , Paul answered , " Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years , I cheerfully make my defense ,
but this I confess to you , that after the Way , which they call a sect , so I serve the God of our fathers , believing all things which are according to the law , and which are written in the prophets ;
having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
now after some years , I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation , and offerings ;
amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , not with a mob , nor with turmoil .
but Felix , having more exact knowledge concerning the Way , deferred them , saying , " When Lysias , the commanding officer , comes down , I will decide your case . "
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
but after some days , Felix came with Drusilla , his wife , who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
as he reasoned about righteousness , self @-@ control , and the judgment to come , Felix was terrified , and answered , " Go your way for this time , and when it is convenient for me , I will summon you . "
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and desiring to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul in bonds .
" let them therefore , " said he , " that are in power among you go down with me , and if there is anything wrong in the man , let them accuse him . "
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
but Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
but Paul said , " I am standing before Caesar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you also know very well .
for if I have done wrong , and have committed anything worthy of death , I don 't refuse to die ; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of , no one can give me up to them . I appeal to Caesar ! "
then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , " You have appealed to Caesar . to Caesar you shall go . "
now when some days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea , and greeted Festus .
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , asking for a sentence against him .
Agrippa said to Festus , " I also would like to hear the man myself . " " tomorrow , " he said , " you shall hear him . "
Festus said , " King Agrippa , and all men who are here present with us , you see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me , both at Jerusalem and here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord . therefore I have brought him forth before you , and especially before you , King Agrippa , that , after examination , I may have something to write .
for it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to also specify the charges against him . "
" indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
having known me from the first , if they are willing to testify , that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
" I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
at noon , O king , I saw on the way a light from the sky , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who traveled with me .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the goads . '
" I said , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' " he said , ' I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
to open their eyes , that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me . '
but declared first to them of Damascus , at Jerusalem , and throughout all the country of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , doing works worthy of repentance .
how the Christ must suffer , and how , by the resurrection of the dead , he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles . "
as he thus made his defense , Festus said with a loud voice , " Paul , you are crazy ! your great learning is driving you insane ! "
Paul said , " I pray to God , that whether with little or with much , not only you , but also all that hear me this day , might become such as I am , except for these bonds . "
Agrippa said to Festus , " This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . "
when it was determined that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius , of the Augustan band .
and said to them , " Sirs , I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . "
when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , close to shore .
when the ship was caught , and couldn 't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
running under the lee of a small island called Clauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat .
as we labored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw things overboard .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " Sirs , you should have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and have gotten this injury and loss .
therefore , sirs , cheer up ! for I believe God , that it will be just as it has been spoken to me .
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , " Unless these stay in the ship , you can 't be saved . "
while the day was coming on , Paul begged them all to take some food , saying , " This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting , having taken nothing .
but the centurion , desiring to save Paul , stopped them from their purpose , and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land ;
and the rest should follow , some on planks , and some on other things from the ship . so it happened that they all escaped safely to the land .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
from there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium . after one day , a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli ,
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
for this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you . for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
when they didn 't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
who was declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the Spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
through whom we received grace and apostleship , for obedience of faith among all the nations , for his name 's sake ;
to all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
who exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
likewise also the men , leaving the natural function of the woman , burned in their lust toward one another , men doing what is inappropriate with men , and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
or do you despise the riches of his goodness , forbearance , and patience , not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @-@ seeking , and don 't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
but now apart from the law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified by the law and the prophets ;
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe . for there is no distinction ,
where then is the boasting ? it is excluded . by what kind of law ? of works ? no , but by a law of faith .
or is God the God of Jews only ? isn 't he the God of Gentiles also ? yes , of Gentiles also ,
for if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not toward God .
for what does the Scripture say ? " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness . "
is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised , or on the uncircumcised also ? for we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness .
how then was it counted ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
he is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in uncircumcision .
for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn 't through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , " So will your seed be . "
without being weakened in faith , he didn 't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah 's womb .
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope doesn 't disappoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
but the free gift isn 't like the trespass . for if by the trespass of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God , and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound to the many .
so then as through one trespass , all men were condemned ; even so through one act of righteousness , all men were justified to life .
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will also be part of his resurrection ;
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bondservants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
but now we have been discharged from the law , having died to that in which we were held ; so that we serve in newness of the spirit , and not in oldness of the letter .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? may it never be ! however , I wouldn 't have known sin , except through the law . for I wouldn 't have known coveting , unless the law had said , " You shall not covet . "
but sin , finding occasion through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of coveting . for apart from the law , sin is dead .
therefore the law indeed is holy , and the commandment holy , and righteous , and good .
did then that which is good become death to me ? may it never be ! but sin , that it might be shown to be sin , by working death to me through that which is good ; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful .
for I don 't know what I am doing . for I don 't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
for the good which I desire , I don 't do ; but the evil which I don 't desire , that I practice .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
but I see a different law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
I thank God through Jesus Christ , our Lord ! so then with the mind , I myself serve God 's law , but with the flesh , the sin 's law .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for what the law couldn 't do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
so then , brothers , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ ; if indeed we suffer with him , that we may also be glorified with him .
for the creation was subjected to vanity , not of its own will , but because of him who subjected it , in hope
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don 't know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can 't be uttered .
he who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit 's mind , because he makes intercession for the saints according to God .
we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
for whom he foreknew , he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .
he who didn 't spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how would he not also with him freely give us all things ?
nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I tell the truth in Christ . I am not lying , my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit ,
for I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers ' sake , my relatives according to the flesh ,
of whom are the fathers , and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh , who is over all , God , blessed forever . Amen .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
neither , because they are Abraham 's seed , are they all children . but , " In Isaac will your seed be called . "
for this is a word of promise , " At the appointed time I will come , and Sarah will have a son . "
for the Scripture says to Pharaoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
but indeed , O man , who are you to reply against God ? will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Why did you make me like this ? "
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
Isaiah cries concerning Israel , " If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , it is the remnant who will be saved ;
as Isaiah has said before , " Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed , we would have become like Sodom , and would have been made like Gomorrah . "
but Israel , following after a law of righteousness , didn 't arrive at the law of righteousness .
why ? because they didn 't seek it by faith , but as it were by works of the law . they stumbled over the stumbling stone ;
even as it is written , " Behold , I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense ; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed . "
for being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they didn 't subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
but what does it say ? " the word is near you , in your mouth , and in your heart " ; that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a preacher ?
but they didn 't all listen to the glad news . for Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our report ? "
but I say , didn 't they hear ? yes , most certainly , " Their sound went out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world . "
but as to Israel he says , " All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . "
I ask then , did God reject his people ? may it never be ! for I also am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
but how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Baal . "
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he didn 't obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
according as it is written , " God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear , to this very day . "
I ask then , did they stumble that they might fall ? may it never be ! but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles , to provoke them to jealousy .
now if their fall is the riches of the world , and their loss the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fullness ?
for if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world , what would their acceptance be , but life from the dead ?
true ; by their unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by your faith . Don 't be conceited , but fear ;
see then the goodness and severity of God . toward those who fell , severity ; but toward you , goodness , if you continue in his goodness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
they also , if they don 't continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
even so these also have now been disobedient , that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy .
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
Don 't be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @-@ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
or he who exhorts , to his exhorting : he who gives , let him do it with liberality ; he who rules , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
Don 't seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " Vengeance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those who exist are ordained by God .
therefore you need to be in subjection , not only because of the wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
for this reason you also pay taxes , for they are servants of God 's service , attending continually on this very thing .
do this , knowing the time , that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep , for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed .
let us walk properly , as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts , and not in strife and jealousy .
who are you who judge another 's servant ? to his own lord he stands or falls . yes , he will be made to stand , for God has power to make him stand .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you despise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . every tongue will confess to God . ' "
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
for even Christ didn 't please himself . but , as it is written , " The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . "
now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God , that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers ,
now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
for I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me , for the obedience of the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
when therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a helper of many , and of my own self .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
to the assembly of God which is at Corinth ; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both theirs and ours :
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
now I mean this , that each one of you says , " I follow Paul , " " I follow Apollos , " " I follow Cephas , " and , " I follow Christ . "
for Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ wouldn 't be made void .
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the lawyer of this world ? hasn 't God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
when I came to you , brothers , I didn 't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
but we speak God 's wisdom in a mystery , the wisdom that has been hidden , which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory ,
which none of the rulers of this world has known . for had they known it , they wouldn 't have crucified the Lord of glory .
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
which things also we speak , not in words which man 's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
" for who has known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? " but we have Christ 's mind .
for you are still fleshly . for insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren 't you fleshly , and don 't you walk in the ways of men ?
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . but let each man be careful how he builds on it .
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . for it is written , " He has taken the wise in their craftiness . "
so let a man think of us as Christ 's servants , and stewards of God 's mysteries .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord comes , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and reveal the counsels of the hearts . then each man will get his praise from God .
now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be puffed up against one another .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
for , I think that God has displayed us , the apostles , last of all , like men sentenced to death . for we are made a spectacle to the world , both to angels and men .
we are fools for Christ 's sake , but you are wise in Christ . we are weak , but you are strong . you have honor , but we have dishonor .
being defamed , we entreat . we are made as the filth of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now .
for though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ , yet not many fathers . for in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the Good News .
because of this I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , even as I teach everywhere in every assembly .
for I most certainly , as being absent in body but present in spirit , have already , as though I were present , judged him who has done this thing .
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . for indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
I say this to move you to shame . isn 't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers ?
or don 't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Don 't be deceived . neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosexuals ,
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
" foods for the belly , and the belly for foods , " but God will bring to nothing both it and them . but the body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? may it never be !
flee sexual immorality ! " every sin that a man does is outside the body , " but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
but , because of sexual immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
Don 't deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn 't tempt you because of your lack of self @-@ control .
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband . otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemblies .
were you called being a bondservant ? Don 't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
now concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy .
are you bound to a wife ? Don 't seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don 't seek a wife .
but if you marry , you have not sinned . if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . yet such will have oppression in the flesh , and I want to spare you .
but I say this , brothers : the time is short , that from now on , both those who have wives may be as though they had none ;
but if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin , if she is past the flower of her age , and if need so requires , let him do what he desires . he doesn 't sin . let them marry .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord .
therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
for though there are things that are called " gods , " whether in the heavens or on earth ; as there are many " gods " and many " lords " ;
yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we live through him .
however , that knowledge isn 't in all men . but some , with consciousness of the idol until now , eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
but be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak .
and through your knowledge , he who is weak perishes , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
if to others I am not an apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? or doesn 't the law also say the same thing ?
or does he say it assuredly for our sake ? yes , it was written for our sake , because he who plows ought to plow in hope , and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope .
if others partake of this right over you , don 't we yet more ? nevertheless we did not use this right , but we bear all things , that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ .
but I have used none of these things , and I don 't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
for if I preach the Good News , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but woe is to me , if I don 't preach the Good News .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
for though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more .
to those who are without law , as without law ( not being without law toward God , but under law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
Don 't you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? run like that , that you may win .
neither be idolaters , as some of them were . as it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . "
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
but if one of those who don 't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
conscience , I say , not your own , but the other 's conscience . for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
but if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given to her for a covering .
for there also must be factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you .
when he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body , which is broken for you . do this in memory of me . "
therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord 's cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God 's Spirit says , " Jesus is accursed . " no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " but by the Holy Spirit .
to another faith , by the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healings , by the same Spirit ;
for in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bond or free ; and were all given to drink into one Spirit .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
but now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired .
that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
if I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don 't have love , I have become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal .
if I dole out all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don 't have love , it profits me nothing .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
for now we see in a mirror , dimly , but then face to face . now I know in part , but then I will know fully , even as I was also fully known .
even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they didn 't give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is piped or harped ?
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
otherwise if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the " Amen " at your giving of thanks , seeing he doesn 't know what you say ?
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
but if all prophesy , and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in , he is reproved by all , and he is judged by all .
and thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed .
what is it then , brothers ? when you come together , each one of you has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has another language , has an interpretation . let all things be done to build each other up .
if any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret .
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
but by the grace of God I am what I am . his grace which was bestowed on me was not futile , but I worked more than all of them ; yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
then the end comes , when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
for , " He put all things in subjection under his feet . " but when he says , " All things are put in subjection , " it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him .
or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? if the dead aren 't raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ?
if I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes , what does it profit me ? if the dead are not raised , then " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . "
that which you sow , you don 't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
it is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
the first man is of the earth , made of dust . the second man is the Lord from heaven .
therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the Lord 's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
but with you it may be that I will stay , or even winter , that you may send me on my journey wherever I go .
therefore let no one despise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
now I beg you , brothers ( you know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have set themselves to serve the saints ) ,
the assemblies of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ;
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
our hope for you is steadfast , knowing that , since you are partakers of the sufferings , so also are you of the comfort .
who delivered us out of so great a death , and does deliver ; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us ;
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
and by you to pass into Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea .
when I therefore was thus determined , did I show fickleness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be the " Yes , yes " and the " No , no ? "
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " Amen , " to the glory of God through us .
who also sealed us , and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
but if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow , not to me , but in part ( that I not press too heavily ) to you all .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
now thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
to the one a stench from death to death ; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life . who is sufficient for these things ?
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit . for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
but if the service of death , written engraved on stones , came with glory , so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face ; which was passing away :
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
but their minds were hardened , for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains , because in Christ it passes away .
but we all , with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord , the Spirit .
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
but we have this treasure in clay vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
for we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh .
but having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , " I believed , and therefore I spoke . " we also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
for we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in the heavens .
therefore also we make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be well pleasing to him .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are revealed to God ; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences .
for we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their sakes died and rose again .
therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on . even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
but all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their trespasses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
for him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf ; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
what agreement has a temple of God with idols ? for you are a temple of the living God . even as God said , " I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people . "
therefore " ' Come out from among them , and be separate , ' says the Lord . ' touch no unclean thing . I will receive you .
I will be to you a Father . you will be to me sons and daughters , ' says the Lord Almighty . "
great is my boldness of speech toward you . great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
and not by his coming only , but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you , while he told us of your longing , your mourning , and your zeal for me ; so that I rejoiced still more .
for though I made you sorry with my letter , I do not regret it , though I did regret it . for I see that my letter made you sorry , though just for a while .
I now rejoice , not that you were made sorry , but that you were made sorry to repentance . for you were made sorry in a godly way , that you might suffer loss by us in nothing .
for godly sorrow works repentance to salvation , which brings no regret . but the sorrow of the world works death .
therefore we have been comforted . in our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies .
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies , and of our boasting on your behalf .
so that I won 't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident boasting .
let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ; not grudgingly , or under compulsion ; for God loves a cheerful giver .
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ;
now I Paul , myself , entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ ; I who in your presence am lowly among you , but being absent am bold toward you .
yes , I beg you that I may not , when present , show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some , who consider us to be walking according to the flesh .
for though we walk in the flesh , we don 't wage war according to the flesh ;
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds ,
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
not boasting beyond proper limits in other men 's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
for I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy . for I married you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
are they Hebrews ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
are they servants of Christ ? ( I speak as one beside himself ) I am more so ; in labors more abundantly , in prisons more abundantly , in stripes above measure , in deaths often .
three times I was beaten with rods . once I was stoned . three times I suffered shipwreck . I have been a night and a day in the deep .
besides those things that are outside , there is that which presses on me daily , anxiety for all the assemblies .
I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I don 't know , or whether out of the body , I don 't know ; God knows ) , such a one caught up into the third heaven .
I know such a man ( whether in the body , or outside of the body , I don 't know ; God knows ) ,
how he was caught up into Paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in injuries , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ 's sake . for when I am weak , then am I strong .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
I exhorted Titus , and I sent the brother with him . did Titus take any advantage of you ? didn 't we walk in the same spirit ? didn 't we walk in the same steps ?
that again when I come my God would humble me before you , and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now , and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed .
this is the third time I am coming to you . " at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . "
for this cause I write these things while absent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for tearing down .
finally , brothers , rejoice . be perfected , be comforted , be of the same mind , live in peace , and the God of love and peace will be with you .
Paul , an apostle ( not from men , neither through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ) ,
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be cursed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man preaches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be cursed .
for am I now seeking the favor of men , or of God ? or am I striving to please men ? for if I were still pleasing men , I wouldn 't be a servant of Christ .
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia . then I returned to Damascus .
now about the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I 'm not lying .
( for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles ) ;
and when they perceived the grace that was given to me , James and Cephas and John , they who were reputed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , that we should go to the Gentiles , and they to the circumcision .
for before some people came from James , he ate with the Gentiles . but when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circumcision .
and the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy ; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
I just want to learn this from you . did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us . for it is written , " Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree , "
now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . he doesn 't say , " To seeds , " as of many , but as of one , " To your seed , " which is Christ .
now I say this . a covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ , the law , which came four hundred thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise ; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise .
what then is the law ? it was added because of transgressions , until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made . it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
but the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
so we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world .
but now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles , to which you desire to be in bondage all over again ?
that which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you didn 't despise nor reject ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
they zealously seek you in no good way . no , they desire to alienate you , that you may seek them .
tell me , you that desire to be under the law , don 't you listen to the law ?
however , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now , for she is in bondage with her children .
for it is written , " Rejoice , you barren who don 't bear . break forth and shout , you that don 't travail . for more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband . "
but I , brothers , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don 't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
for the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary to one another , that you may not do the things that you desire .
now the works of the flesh are obvious , which are : adultery , sexual immorality , uncleanness , lustfulness ,
envyings , murders , drunkenness , orgies , and things like these ; of which I forewarn you , even as I also forewarned you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; looking to yourself so that you also aren 't tempted .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don 't give up .
but far be it from me to boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ;
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love ;
in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
who is a pledge of our inheritance , to the redemption of God 's own possession , to the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
having the eyes of your hearts enlightened , that you may know what is the hope of his calling , and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
far above all rule , and authority , and power , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this age , but also in that which is to come .
he put all things in subjection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly ,
in which you once walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience ;
among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh , doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , even as the rest .
even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved ) ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
having abolished in the flesh the hostility , the law of commandments contained in ordinances , that he might create in himself one new man of the two , making peace ;
by which , when you read , you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ ;
that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News ,
and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God , who created all things through Jesus Christ ;
there is one body , and one Spirit , even as you also were called in one hope of your calling ;
he who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
he gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , shepherds and teachers ;
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
and put on the new man , who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet @-@ smelling fragrance .
know this for sure , that no sexually immoral person , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God .
speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the savior of the body .
even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . he who loves his own wife loves himself .
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
with all prayer and requests , praying at all times in the Spirit , and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints :
on my behalf , that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News ,
for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ .
it is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you , because I have you in my heart , because , both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News , you all are partakers with me of grace .
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News .
what does it matter ? only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed . I rejoice in this , yes , and will rejoice .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ , that , whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your state , that you stand firm in one spirit , with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News ;
make my joy full , by being like @-@ minded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind ;
therefore God also highly exalted him , and gave to him the name which is above every name ;
for it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
that you may become blameless and harmless , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you are seen as lights in the world ,
yes , and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice with you all .
but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not tiresome , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circumcision , who worship God in the Spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ;
though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . if any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; concerning the law , a Pharisee ;
and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own , that which is of the law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is from God by faith ;
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming conformed to his death ;
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
yes , I beg you also , true yokefellow , help these women , for they labored with me in the Good News , with Clement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
I know how to be humbled , and I know also how to abound . in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in need .
you yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
we give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints ,
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don 't cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
that you may walk worthily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
for by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations . but now it has been revealed to his saints ,
to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory ;
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
be careful that you don 't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ .
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels , dwelling in the things which he has not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
and not holding firmly to the Head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments , grows with God 's growth .
put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual immorality , uncleanness , depraved passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
but now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and shameful speaking out of your mouth .
and have put on the new man , who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator ,
put on therefore , as God 's chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , humility , and perseverance ;
bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also do .
servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God .
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality .
praying together for us also , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ;
let your speech always be with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one .
together with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they will make known to you everything that is going on here .
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , salutes you , always striving for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
tell Archippus , " Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . "
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father .
and that our Good News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
you became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
but having suffered before and been shamefully treated , as you know , at Philippi , we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict .
even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
for you , brothers , became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus ; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen , even as they did from the Jews ;
who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets , and drove us out , and didn 't please God , and are contrary to all men ;
but when Timothy came just now to us from you , and brought us glad news of your faith and love , and that you have good memories of us always , longing to see us , even as we also long to see you ;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
finally then , brothers , we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God , that you abound more and more .
therefore he who rejects this doesn 't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
but concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . but we exhort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
that you may walk properly toward those who are outside , and may have need of nothing .
but we don 't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don 't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord forever .
you are all children of light , and children of the day . we don 't belong to the night , nor to darkness ,
but we beg you , brothers , to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ,
see that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , for one another , and for all .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure .
and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire ,
giving vengeance to those who don 't know God , and to those who don 't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus ,
who will pay the penalty : eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might ,
when he comes to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired among all those who have believed ( because our testimony to you was believed ) in that day .
to this end we also pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of your calling , and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith , with power ;
now , brothers , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and our gathering together to him , we ask you
not to be quickly shaken in your mind , nor yet be troubled , either by spirit , or by word , or by letter as from us , saying that the day of Christ had come .
let no one deceive you in any way . for it will not be , unless the departure comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of destruction ,
he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped ; so that he sits as God in the temple of God , setting himself up as God .
now you know what is restraining him , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
that they all might be judged who didn 't believe the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
but we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers loved by the Lord , because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth ;
to which he called you through our Good News , for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified , even as also with you ;
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
for we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion , who don 't work at all , but are busybodies .
now those who are that way , we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the Lord be with you all .
as I urged you when I was going into Macedonia , stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
but the goal of this command is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith ;
as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
the saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
however , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first , Jesus Christ might display all his patience , for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life .
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
but I don 't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
but she will be saved through her childbearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety .
moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside , to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil .
but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God 's house , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
without controversy , the mystery of godliness is great : God was revealed in the flesh , justified in the spirit , seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , and received up in glory .
but the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons ,
for every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with thanksgiving .
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
but if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old , having been the wife of one man ,
if any man or woman who believes has widows , let them relieve them , and don 't let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed .
let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
I command you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the chosen angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed .
constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth , who suppose that godliness is a means of gain . withdraw yourself from such .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
fight the good fight of faith . lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called , and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
I command you before God , who gives life to all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession ,
charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who richly provides us with everything to enjoy ;
I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for God didn 't give us a spirit of fear , but of power , love , and self @-@ control .
therefore don 't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God ,
who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal ,
for this cause I also suffer these things . yet I am not ashamed , for I know him whom I have believed , and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day .
this you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord 's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at Ephesus , you know very well .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
also , if anyone competes in athletics , he isn 't crowned unless he has competed by the rules .
therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones ' sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
however God 's firm foundation stands , having this seal , " The Lord knows those who are his , " and , " Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness . "
if anyone therefore purges himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , and suitable for the master 's use , prepared for every good work .
flee from youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
for some of these are people who creep into houses , and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts ,
even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , who concerning the faith , are rejected .
persecutions , and sufferings : those things that happened to me at Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . I endured those persecutions . out of them all the Lord delivered me .
from infancy , you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith , which is in Christ Jesus .
for the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having itching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
from now on , there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give to me on that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing .
Alexander , the coppersmith , did much evil to me . the Lord will repay him according to his works ,
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
if anyone is blameless , the husband of one wife , having children who believe , who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior .
for the overseer must be blameless , as God 's steward ; not self @-@ pleasing , not easily angered , not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain ;
but given to hospitality , a lover of good , sober minded , fair , holy , self @-@ controlled ;
whose mouths must be stopped ; men who overthrow whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for dishonest gain 's sake .
one of them , a prophet of their own , said , " Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , and idle gluttons . "
and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior , not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine , teachers of that which is good ;
to be sober minded , chaste , workers at home , kind , being in subjection to their own husbands , that God 's word may not be blasphemed .
instructing us to the intent that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we would live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present world ;
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ ;
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify for himself a people for his own possession , zealous for good works .
not by works of righteousness , which we did ourselves , but according to his mercy , he saved us , through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit ,
that , being justified by his grace , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
this saying is faithful , and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently , so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works . these things are good and profitable to men ;
when I send Artemas to you , or Tychicus , be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis , for I have determined to winter there .
I beg you for my child , whom I have become the father of in my chains , Onesimus ,
whom I desired to keep with me , that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News .
but I was willing to do nothing without your consent , that your goodness would not be as of necessity , but of free will .
no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much rather to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
again , when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says , " Let all the angels of God worship him . "
of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows . "
and , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the works of your hands .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation--which at the first having been spoken through the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard ;
for he didn 't subject the world to come , of which we speak , to angels .
but one has somewhere testified , saying , " What is man , that you think of him ? or the son of man , that you care for him ?
you have put all things in subjection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don 't see all things subjected to him , yet .
but we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels , Jesus , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one , for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
again , " I will put my trust in him . " again , " Behold , here I am with the children whom God has given me . "
Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ,
therefore I was displeased with that generation , and said , ' They always err in their heart , but they didn 't know my ways ; '
but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called " today " ; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
for we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end :
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I swore in my wrath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
for we don 't have a high priest who can 't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
for every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
so also Christ didn 't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
for although by this time you should be teachers , you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God . you have come to need milk , and not solid food .
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ , let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works , of faith toward God ,
of the teaching of baptisms , of laying on of hands , of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
but if it bears thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near being cursed , whose end is to be burned .
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
this hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
for this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God ) , remains a priest continually .
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best spoils .
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises .
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them .
who doesn 't need , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices daily , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . for he did this once for all , when he offered up himself .
for the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness , but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected .
for finding fault with them , he said , " Behold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
the Holy Spirit is indicating this , that the way into the Holy Place wasn 't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant , that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
for Christ hasn 't entered into holy places made with hands , which are representations of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ;
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ,
for the law , having a shadow of the good to come , not the very image of the things , can never with the same sacrifices year by year , which they offer continually , make perfect those who draw near .
or else wouldn 't they have ceased to be offered , because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ?
therefore when he comes into the world , he says , " Sacrifice and offering you didn 't desire , but you prepared a body for me ;
then I said , ' Behold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . ' "
let 's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water ,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries .
for we know him who said , " Vengeance belongs to me , " says the Lord , " I will repay . " again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
but remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ;
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
by faith , Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous , God testifying with respect to his gifts ; and through it he , being dead , still speaks .
by faith , Enoch was taken away , so that he wouldn 't see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with godly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead .
but now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . therefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , grew mighty in war , and caused foreign armies to flee .
they were stoned . they were sawn apart . they were tempted . they were slain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill @-@ treated
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don 't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don 't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us , and we paid them respect . shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
all chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby .
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ;
for you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears .
for you have not come to a mountain that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and to blackness , darkness , storm ,
the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them ,
but you have come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to innumerable multitudes of angels ,
to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , to God the Judge of all , to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel .
see that you don 't refuse him who speaks . for if they didn 't escape when they refused him who warned on the earth , how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven ,
whose voice shook the earth then , but now he has promised , saying , " Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . "
therefore , receiving a Kingdom that can 't be shaken , let us have grace , through which we serve God acceptably , with reverence and awe ,
Don 't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
so that with good courage we say , " The Lord is my helper . I will not fear . what can man do to me ? "
we have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat .
therefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people through his own blood , suffered outside of the gate .
obey your leaders and submit to them , for they watch on behalf of your souls , as those who will give account , that they may do this with joy , and not with groaning , for that would be unprofitable for you .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion : greetings .
but let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
and the rich , in that he is made humble , because like the flower in the grass , he will pass away .
blessed is the man who endures temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
therefore , putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with humility the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a hearer who forgets , but a doer of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does .
and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing , and say , " Sit here in a good place " ; and you tell the poor man , " Stand there , " or " Sit by my footstool " ;
listen , my beloved brothers . didn 't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
for he who said , " Do not commit adultery , " also said , " Do not commit murder . " now if you do not commit adultery , but murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
and one of you tells them , " Go in peace , be warmed and filled " ; and yet you didn 't give them the things the body needs , what good is it ?
and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness " ; and he was called the friend of God .
for in many things we all stumble . if anyone doesn 't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet guided by a very small rudder , wherever the pilot desires .
so the tongue is also a little member , and boasts great things . see how a small fire can spread to a large forest !
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom .
you adulterers and adulteresses , don 't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
but he gives more grace . therefore it says , " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
be subject therefore to God . but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
Don 't speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
whereas you don 't know what your life will be like tomorrow . for what is your life ? for you are a vapor , that appears for a little time , and then vanishes away .
your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
you also be patient . establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
Don 't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won 't be judged . behold , the judge stands at the door .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
behold , we call them blessed who endured . you have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the Lord in the outcome , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
confess your offenses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . the insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective .
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn 't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood : grace to you and peace be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
whom not having known you love ; in whom , though now you don 't see him , yet believing , you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--
searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he predicted the sufferings of Christ , and the glories that would follow them .
knowing that you were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers ,
who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection , love one another from the heart fervently :
for , " All flesh is like grass , and all of man 's glory like the flower in the grass . the grass withers , and its flower falls ;
but the Lord 's word endures forever . " this is the word of Good News which was preached to you .
you also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
because it is contained in Scripture , " Behold , I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone , chosen , and precious : he who believes in him will not be disappointed . "
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
having good behavior among the nations , so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they see , glorify God in the day of visitation .
servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the wicked .
for what glory is it if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? but if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is commendable with God .
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
for this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God also adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you now are , if you do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
you husbands , in the same way , live with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor to the woman , as to the weaker vessel , as being also joint heirs of the grace of life ; that your prayers may not be hindered .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit .
but even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you are blessed . " Don 't fear what they fear , neither be troubled . "
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for it is better , if it is God 's will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil .
because Christ also suffered for sins once , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring you to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ;
who before were disobedient , when God waited patiently in the days of Noah , while the ship was being built . in it , few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water .
who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him .
forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
as each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms .
but because you are partakers of Christ 's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy .
if you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men 's matters .
therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him , as to a faithful Creator .
neither as lording it over those entrusted to you , but making yourselves examples to the flock .
be sober and self @-@ controlled . be watchful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
she who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark , my son .
greet one another with a kiss of love . peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
yes , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply moral excellence ; and in moral excellence , knowledge ;
therefore , brothers , be more diligent to make your calling and election sure . for if you do these things , you will never stumble .
for thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
I think it right , as long as I am in this tent , to stir you up by reminding you ;
yes , I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure .
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for he received from God the Father honor and glory , when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
but false prophets also arose among the people , as false teachers will also be among you , who will secretly bring in destructive heresies , denying even the Master who bought them , bringing on themselves swift destruction .
many will follow their immoral ways , and as a result , the way of the truth will be maligned .
in covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words : whose sentence now from of old doesn 't linger , and their destruction will not slumber .
for if God didn 't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and didn 't spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven others , a preacher of righteousness , when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement , and despise authority . daring , self @-@ willed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries ;
but these , as unreasoning creatures , born natural animals to be taken and destroyed , speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant , will in their destroying surely be destroyed ,
having eyes full of adultery , and who can 't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing ;
but he was rebuked for his own disobedience . a mute donkey spoke with a man 's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet .
these are wells without water , clouds driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
for , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the apostles of the Lord and Savior :
and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? for , from the day that the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation . "
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this , what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness ,
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
but whoever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perfected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
brothers , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning .
I write to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
whoever denies the Son , the same doesn 't have the Father . he who confesses the Son has the Father also .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world doesn 't know us , because it didn 't know him .
beloved , now we are children of God , and it is not yet revealed what we will be . but we know that , when he is revealed , we will be like him ; for we will see him just as he is .
he who sins is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . to this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
beloved , don 't believe every spirit , but test the spirits , whether they are of God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
and every spirit who doesn 't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Antichrist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
we are of God . he who knows God listens to us . he who is not of God doesn 't listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has punishment . he who fears is not made perfect in love .
this is he who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and the blood . it is the Spirit who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who doesn 't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
he who has the Son has the life . he who doesn 't have God 's Son doesn 't have the life .
we know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
now I beg you , dear lady , not as though I wrote to you a new commandment , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
for many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who don 't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . this is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
whoever transgresses and doesn 't remain in the teaching of Christ , doesn 't have God . he who remains in the teaching , the same has both the Father and the Son .
having many things to write to you , I don 't want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
therefore if I come , I will call attention to his deeds which he does , unjustly accusing us with wicked words . not content with this , neither does he himself receive the brothers , and those who would , he forbids and throws out of the assembly .
beloved , don 't imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . he who does good is of God . he who does evil hasn 't seen God .
Demetrius has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
for there are certain men who crept in secretly , even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation : ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into indecency , and denying our only Master , God , and Lord , Jesus Christ .
angels who didn 't keep their first domain , but deserted their own dwelling place , he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
but Michael , the archangel , when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation , but said , " May the Lord rebuke you ! "
but these speak evil of whatever things they don 't know . what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , they are destroyed in these things .
woe to them ! for they went in the way of Cain , and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire , and perished in Korah 's rebellion .
wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
to execute judgment on all , and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way , and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "
they said to you that " In the last time there will be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts . "
this is the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
John , to the seven assemblies that are in Asia : grace to you and peace , from God , who is and who was and who is to come ; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne ;
and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . to him who loves us , and washed us from our sins by his blood ;
and he made us to be a Kingdom , priests to his God and Father ; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
behold , he is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see him , including those who pierced him . all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him . even so , Amen .
" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , " who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . "
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trumpet
his feet were like burnished brass , as if it had been refined in a furnace . his voice was like the voice of many waters .
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen hereafter ;
" to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . he who overcomes won 't be harmed by the second death .
repent therefore , or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
but I have this against you , that you tolerate your woman , Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess . she teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality , and to eat things sacrificed to idols .
behold , I will throw her into a bed , and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression , unless they repent of her works .
I will kill her children with Death , and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts . I will give to each one of you according to your deeds .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and didn 't deny my name .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
behold , I stand at the door and knock . if anyone hears my voice and opens the door , then I will come in to him , and will dine with him , and he with me .
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
out of the throne proceed lightnings , sounds , and thunders . there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
when the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to him who sits on the throne , to him who lives forever and ever ,
the twenty @-@ four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever , and throw their crowns before the throne , saying ,
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book , and to break its seals ? "
one of the elders said to me , " Don 't weep . behold , the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has overcome ; he who opens the book and its seven seals . "
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @-@ four elders fell down before the Lamb , each one having a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
they sang a new song , saying , " You are worthy to take the book , and to open its seals : for you were killed , and bought us for God with your blood , out of every tribe , language , people , and nation ,
saying with a loud voice , " Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power , wealth , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and blessing ! "
I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , as with a voice of thunder , " Come and see ! "
another came forth , a red horse . to him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another . there was given to him a great sword .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenix of barley for a denarius ! Don 't damage the oil and the wine ! "
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " How long , Master , the holy and true , until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? "
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
for the great day of his wrath has come ; and who is able to stand ? "
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshiped God ,
one of the elders answered , saying to me , " These who are arrayed in white robes , who are they , and from where did they come ? "
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the Lamb 's blood .
for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
another angel came and stood over the altar , having a golden censer . much incense was given to him , that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne .
the angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the fourth angel sounded , and one third of the sun was struck , and one third of the moon , and one third of the stars ; so that one third of them would be darkened , and the day wouldn 't shine for one third of it , and the night in the same way .
the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth . the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
they were given power not to kill them , but to torment them for five months . their torment was like the torment of a scorpion , when it strikes a person .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky , clothed with a cloud . a rainbow was on his head . his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
when the seven thunders sounded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky saying , " Seal up the things which the seven thunders said , and don 't write them . "
and swore by him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , that there will no longer be delay ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I went to the angel , telling him to give me the little book . he said to me , " Take it , and eat it up . it will make your stomach bitter , but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey . "
a reed like a rod was given to me . someone said , " Rise , and measure God 's temple , and the altar , and those who worship in it .
these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands , standing before the Lord of the earth .
these have the power to shut up the sky , that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy . they have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
in that day there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
saying : " we give you thanks , Lord God , the Almighty , the one who is and who was ; because you have taken your great power , and reigned .
God 's temple that is in heaven was opened , and the ark of the Lord 's covenant was seen in his temple . Lightnings , sounds , thunders , an earthquake , and great hail followed .
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him . authority to make war for forty @-@ two months was given to him .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
he performs great signs , even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as wouldn 't worship the image of the beast to be killed .
I saw , and behold , the Lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their foreheads .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
they sing a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , those who had been redeemed out of the earth .
these are those who were not defiled with women , for they are virgins . these are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . these were redeemed by Jesus from among men , the first fruits to God and to the Lamb .
another , a second angel , followed , saying , " Babylon the great has fallen , which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality . "
another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a great voice , " If anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives a mark on his forehead , or on his hand ,
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sickle , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
the angel thrust his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vintage of the earth , and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
they sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , " Great and marvelous are your works , Lord God , the Almighty ! righteous and true are your ways , you King of the nations .
who wouldn 't fear you , Lord , and glorify your name ? for you only are holy . for all the nations will come and worship before you . for your righteous acts have been revealed . "
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . they deserve this . "
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scorch men with fire .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness . I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet @-@ colored animal , full of blasphemous names , having seven heads and ten horns .
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth .
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
these will war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome them , for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings . they also will overcome who are with him , called and chosen and faithful . "
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
after these things , I saw another angel coming down out of the sky , having great authority . the earth was illuminated with his glory .
I heard another voice from heaven , saying , " Come out of her , my people , that you have no participation in her sins , and that you don 't receive of her plagues ,
however much she glorified herself , and grew wanton , so much give her of torment and mourning . for she says in her heart , ' I sit a queen , and am no widow , and will in no way see mourning . '
therefore in one day her plagues will come : death , mourning , and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire ; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
standing far away for the fear of her torment , saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for your judgment has come in one hour . '
the fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , she who was dressed in fine linen , purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls !
for in an hour such great riches are made desolate . ' every shipmaster , and everyone who sails anywhere , and mariners , and as many as gain their living by sea , stood far away ,
and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning , saying , ' What is like the great city ? '
" rejoice over her , O heaven , you saints , apostles , and prophets ; for God has judged your judgment on her . "
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Thus with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived .
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
the twenty @-@ four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Give praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty thunders , saying , " Hallelujah ! for the Lord our God , the Almighty , reigns !
I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True . in righteousness he judges and makes war .
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF Lords . "
I saw an angel standing in the sun . he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in the sky , " Come ! be gathered together to the great supper of God ,
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away , and the sea is no more .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he who sits on the throne said , " Behold , I am making all things new . " he said , " Write , for these words of God are faithful and true . "
but for the cowardly , unbelieving , sinners , abominable , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls , who were loaded with the seven last plagues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the Lamb 's bride . "
the city lies foursquare , and its length is as great as its breadth . he measured the city with the reed , Twelve thousand twelve stadia . its length , breadth , and height are equal .
its wall is one hundred forty @-@ four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the twelve gates were twelve pearls . each one of the gates was made of one pearl . the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
there will in no way enter into it anything profane , or one who causes an abomination or a lie , but only those who are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
he said to me , " These words are faithful and true . the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon . "
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the Bright and Morning Star . "
he who testifies these things says , " Yes , I come quickly . " Amen ! yes , come , Lord Jesus .
and God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and God called the dry land Earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
and God said , Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
and God said , Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens ,
and the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the LORD God said , It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help meet for him .
and the rib , which the LORD God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . and he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
and he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
and the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? and the woman said , The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat .
and the LORD God said unto the serpent , Because thou hast done this , thou art cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life :
unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
and she again bare his brother Abel . and Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
and Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering :
and Cain talked with Abel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him .
and Lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
and his brother 's name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and Zillah , she also bare tubal @-@ Cain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of tubal @-@ Cain was Naamah .
and Lamech said unto his wives , Adah and Zillah , Hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : for I have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name Seth :
and the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
and it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
and the LORD said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that I have made them .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
but with thee will I establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
and they went in unto Noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the LORD shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
and he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and Noah builded an altar unto the LORD ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
and the LORD smelled a sweet savour ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .
I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , This is the token of the covenant , which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of Noah , that went forth of the ark , were Shem , and Ham , and Japheth : and Ham is the father of Canaan .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
the sons of Japheth ; Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
out of that land went forth Asshur , and builded Nineveh , and the city Rehoboth , and Calah ,
and unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother 's name was Joktan .
and they said one to another , Go to , let us make brick , and burn them throughly . and they had brick for stone , and slime had they for morter .
and the LORD said , Behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
now the LORD had said unto Abram , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that I will shew thee :
and I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
so Abram departed , as the LORD had spoken unto him ; and Lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
and Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . and the Canaanite was then in the land .
and the LORD appeared unto Abram , and said , Unto thy seed will I give this land : and there builded he an altar unto the LORD , who appeared unto him .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
say , I pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with me for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it came to pass , that , when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
the princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh : and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
and he entreated Abram well for her sake : and he had sheep , and oxen , and he asses , and menservants , and maidservants , and she asses , and camels .
and Pharaoh called Abram , and said , What is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and Hai ;
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdmen of Lot 's cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and Abram said unto Lot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , and between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; for we be brethren .
and Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou comest unto Zoar .
and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for I will give it unto thee .
and in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzims in Ham , and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim ,
and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and they took Lot , Abram 's brother 's son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and the king of Sodom said unto Abram , Give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
after these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision , saying , Fear not , Abram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
and Abram said , Lord GOD , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ?
and Abram said , Behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the LORD came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
and he said unto him , I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full .
in the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates :
and he went in unto Hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and Sarai said unto Abram , My wrong be upon thee : I have given my maid into thy bosom ; and when she saw that she had conceived , I was despised in her eyes : the LORD judge between me and thee .
but Abram said unto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thy hand ; do to her as it pleaseth thee . and when Sarai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
and the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
and he said , Hagar , Sarai 's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ? and she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
and the angel of the LORD said unto her , Behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction .
and he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
and when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
and I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and God said , Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
and said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .
and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah , and said , Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes upon the hearth .
and Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he hasted to dress it .
and he said , I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life ; and , lo , Sarah thy wife shall have a son . and Sarah heard it in the tent door , which was behind him .
now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
is any thing too hard for the LORD ? at the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son .
and the men rose up from thence , and looked toward Sodom : and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
and the LORD said , If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sakes .
and Abraham answered and said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , which am but dust and ashes :
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? and he said , If I find there forty and five , I will not destroy it .
and he spake unto him yet again , and said , Peradventure there shall be forty found there . and he said , I will not do it for forty 's sake .
and he said unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Peradventure there shall thirty be found there . and he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Peradventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and the LORD went his way , as soon as he had left communing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
and there came two angels to Sodom at even ; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bake unleavened bread , and they did eat .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD ; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it .
and when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
and while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the LORD being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
and it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
and he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt .
and the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
and the firstborn bare a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Benammi : the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
said he not unto me , She is my sister ? and she , even she herself said , He is my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this .
now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are thine .
and Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will slay me for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and unto Sarah he said , Behold , I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes , unto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus she was reproved .
for Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
and she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children suck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
Wherefore she said unto Abraham , Cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave it unto Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Beer @-@ sheba .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
and God heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven , and said unto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ? fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest :
and Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water , which Abimelech 's servants had violently taken away .
and he said , For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that I have digged this well .
and he said , Take now thy son , thine only son Isaac , whom thou LOVEST , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and Abraham said unto his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you ,
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my son . and he said , Behold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
and Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I.
and he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
so Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer @-@ sheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beer @-@ sheba .
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you : give me a possession of a buryingplace with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth : and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
nay , my lord , hear me : the field give I thee , and the cave that is therein , I give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury thy dead .
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of Ephron , which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field , and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth .
and Abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things .
and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and he said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master Abraham .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and said , Whose daughter art thou ? tell me , I pray thee : is there room in thy father 's house for us to lodge in ?
and Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
and he said , Come in , thou blessed of the LORD ; wherefore standest thou without ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
and the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine errand . and he said , Speak on .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
and Sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
but thou shalt go unto my father 's house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
and he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
and she say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master 's son .
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
and I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bare unto him : and I put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
and I bowed down my head , and worshipped the LORD , and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto his son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be thy master 's son 's wife , as the LORD hath spoken .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tarried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , Send me away unto my master .
and her brother and her mother said , Let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and they called Rebekah , and said unto her , Wilt thou go with this man ? and she said , I will go .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a Vail , and covered herself .
and Jokshan begat Sheba , and Dedan . and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim .
then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai @-@ ROI .
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
and they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur , that is before Egypt , as thou goest toward Assyria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan @-@ aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Esau 's heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .
and the boys grew : and Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
and Esau said to Jacob , Feed me , I pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for I am faint : therefore was his name called Edom .
and Jacob said , swear to me this day ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto Jacob .
then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Esau despised his birthright .
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar .
and the LORD appeared unto him , and said , Go not down into Egypt ; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of :
sojourn in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
and Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac 's herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him .
and he removed from thence , and digged another well ; and for that they strove not : and he called the name of it Rehoboth ; and he said , For now the LORD hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
and the LORD appeared unto him the same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham 's sake .
and he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there : and there Isaac 's servants digged a well .
then Abimelech went to him from Gerar , and Ahuzzath one of his friends , and Phichol the chief captain of his army .
and they said , We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee : and we said , Let there be now an oath betwixt us , even betwixt us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and he said , Behold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
and make me savoury meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
and Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son . and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
my father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and Jacob said unto his father , I am Esau thy firstborn ; I have done according as thou badest me : arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
and Isaac said unto Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Esau or not .
and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed :
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
and he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and Esau said unto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . and Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
and these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , Behold , thy brother Esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him : then I will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should I be deprived also of you both in one day ?
and Rebekah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
and Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
arise , go to Padan @-@ aram , to the house of Bethuel thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother 's brother .
and give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
and Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Padan @-@ aram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother .
then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
and he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and , behold , the LORD stood above it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ;
and , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
and Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Bethel : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
and Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks : and a great stone was upon the well 's mouth .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and they said , We CANNOT , until all the flocks be gathered together , and till they roll the stone from the well 's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Laban all these things .
and Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
and Laban said , It is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
and it came to pass , that in the morning , behold , it was Leah : and he said to Laban , What is this thou hast done unto me ? did not I serve with thee for Rachel ? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ?
and Laban said , It must not be so done in our country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
and Leah conceived , and bare a son , and she called his name Reuben : for she said , Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love me .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
and Rachel said , God hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name Dan .
and Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . then Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son 's mandrakes .
and she said unto her , Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son 's mandrakes also ? and Rachel said , Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son 's mandrakes .
and Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son 's mandrakes . and he lay with her that night .
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
and Laban said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes , tarry : for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
I will pass through all thy flock to day , removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats : and of such shall be my hire .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and Jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chesnut tree ; and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and the man increased exceedingly , and had much cattle , and maidservants , and menservants , and camels , and asses .
and he heard the words of Laban 's sons , saying , Jacob hath taken away all that was our father 's ; and of that which was our father 's hath he gotten all this glory .
and the LORD said unto Jacob , Return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and I will be with thee .
I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
for all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do .
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Padan @-@ aram , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
and God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
and Laban said to Jacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away unawares to me , and carried away my daughters , as captives taken with the sword ?
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me ; and didst not tell me , that I might have sent thee away with mirth , and with songs , with tabret , and with harp ?
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight , saying , Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
and Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee . for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
and Laban went into Jacob 's tent , and into Leah 's tent , and into the two maidservants ' tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the camel 's furniture , and sat upon them . and Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
and Jacob was wroth , and CHODE with Laban : and Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my trespass ? what is my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
this twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
and Jacob said unto his brethren , Gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
and when Jacob saw them , he said , This is God 's host : and he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
and he commanded them , saying , Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau ; Thy servant Jacob saith thus , I have sojourned with Laban , and stayed there until now :
then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
and said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
and Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee :
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and thou saidst , I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which CANNOT be numbered for multitude .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
then thou shalt say , They be thy servant Jacob 's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
and Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and he said , Let me go , for the day breaketh . and he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
and Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . and he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . and he urged him , and he took it .
and he said unto him , My lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me : and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
and Esau said , Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me . and he said , What needeth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
and the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were grieved , and they were very wroth , because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
ask me never so much dowry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
and they said unto them , We CANNOT do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us :
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
these men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
and unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
and they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went out .
the sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
and God said unto Jacob , Arise , go up to Bethel , and dwell there : and make there an altar unto God , that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother .
then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and he built there an altar , and called the place El @-@ Beth @-@ el : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
but Deborah Rebekah 's nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called Allon @-@ bachuth .
and God appeared unto Jacob again , when he came out of Padan @-@ aram , and blessed him .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins ;
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the midwife said unto her , Fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel 's grave unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father 's concubine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
the sons of Leah ; Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn , and Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Zebulun :
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
these are the names of Esau 's sons ; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau .
and Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau 's son ; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek : these were the sons of Adah Esau 's wife .
and these are the sons of Reuel ; Nahath , and Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah : these were the sons of Bashemath Esau 's wife .
and these were the sons of Aholibamah , the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : and she bare to Esau Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah .
these were dukes of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau ; duke Teman , duke Omar , duke Zepho , duke Kenaz ,
and these are the sons of Reuel Esau 's son ; duke Nahath , duke Zerah , duke Shammah , duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau 's wife .
and these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau 's wife ; duke Jeush , duke Jaalam , duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Seir the Horite , who inhabited the land ; Lotan , and Shobal , and Zibeon , and Anah ,
and the children of Shobal were these ; Alvan , and Manahath , and Ebal , Shepho , and Onam .
and these are the children of Zibeon ; both Ajah , and Anah : this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father .
these are the dukes that came of the Horites ; duke Lotan , duke Shobal , duke Zibeon , duke Anah ,
Duke Dishon , duke Ezer , duke Dishan : these are the dukes that came of Hori , among their dukes in the land of Seir .
and Husham died , and hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and Baal @-@ Hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pau ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; duke Timnah , duke Alvah , duke Jetheth ,
Duke Magdiel , duke Iram : these be the dukes of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession : he is Esau the father of the Edomites .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
for , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
and his brethren said to him , shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send thee unto them . and he said to him , Here am I.
and he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flocks ; and bring me word again . so he sent him out of the vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
and he said , I seek my brethren : tell me , I pray thee , where they feed their flocks .
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
come , and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . and his brethren were content .
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no .
and he knew it , and said , It is my son 's coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him ; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . thus his father wept for him .
and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a son ; and called his name Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bare him .
and Er , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD slew him .
and Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and he said , I will send thee a kid from the flock . and she said , Wilt thou give me a pledge , till thou send it ?
and he said , What pledge shall I give thee ? and she said , Thy signet , and thy bracelets , and thy staff that is in thine hand . and he gave it her , and came in unto her , and she conceived by him .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her Vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive his pledge from the woman 's hand : but he found her not .
then he asked the men of that place , saying , Where is the harlot , that was openly by the way side ? and they said , There was no harlot in this place .
and he returned to Judah , and said , I CANNOT find her ; and also the men of the place said , that there was no harlot in this place .
and Judah acknowledged them , and said , She hath been more righteous than I ; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son . and he knew her again no more .
and it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first ,
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called Zarah .
and the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
there is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ?
and it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
that she called unto the men of her house , and spake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she spake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto Joseph , I also was in my dream , and , behold , I had three white baskets on my head :
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . and Pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
and we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in unto Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and I have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favoured ; and they fed in a meadow :
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and Joseph said unto Pharaoh , The dream of Pharaoh is one : God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do .
this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : what God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh .
and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Pharaoh called Joseph 's name Zaphnath @-@ paaneah ; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On . and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh : for God , said he , hath made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
and the seven years of plenteousness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
and he said , Behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and Joseph saw his brethren , and he knew them , but made himself strange unto them , and spake roughly unto them ; and he said unto them , whence come ye ? and they said , From the land of Canaan to buy food .
and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them , and said unto them , Ye are spies ; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and they said , Thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
send one of you , and let him fetch your brother , and ye shall be kept in prison , that your words may be proved , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies .
and they said one to another , We are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soul , when he besought us , and we would not hear ; therefore is this distress come upon us .
and Reuben answered them , saying , spake I not unto you , saying , Do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and he said unto his brethren , My money is restored ; and , lo , it is even in my sack : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to another , What is this that God hath done unto us ?
we be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan .
and bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall I know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and he said , My son shall not go down with you ; for his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
and it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
and Judah said unto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they communed with him at the door of the house ,
and it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and he said , Peace be to you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , hath given you treasure in your sacks : I had your money . and he brought Simeon out unto them .
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , Is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? is he yet alive ?
and he washed his face , and went out , and refrained himself , and said , Set on bread .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews ; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but Benjamin 's mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were merry with him .
and he commanded the steward of his house , saying , Fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
and when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his steward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondmen .
and Judah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord 's servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Judah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as Pharaoh .
and we said unto my lord , We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him .
and the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
now therefore when I come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad 's life ;
now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith thy son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children 's children , and thy flocks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
and there will I nourish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto thy brethren , This do ye ; Lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
and told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . and Jacob 's heart fainted , for he believed them not .
and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night , and said , Jacob , Jacob . and he said , Here am I.
and he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
I will go down with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
and Jacob rose up from Beer @-@ sheba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
and the sons of Judah ; Er , and Onan , and Shelah , and Pharez , and Zerah : but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan . and the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul .
these be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padan @-@ aram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
and the sons of Gad ; Ziphion , and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , ERI , and Arodi , and Areli .
and the sons of Asher ; Jimnah , and Ishuah , and Isui , and Beriah , and Serah their sister : and the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
and unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and the sons of Benjamin were Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera , and Naaman , Ehi , and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard .
these are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
these are the sons of Bilhah , which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt , which came out of his loins , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were threescore and six ;
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Now let me die , since I have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;
and the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
that ye shall say , Thy servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
and Pharaoh said unto his brethren , What is your occupation ? and they said unto Pharaoh , Thy servants are shepherds , both we , and also our fathers .
they said moreover unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
and when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came unto Joseph , and said , Give us bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became Pharaoh 's .
only the land of the priests bought he not ; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh , and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them : Wherefore they sold not their lands .
then Joseph said unto the people , Behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and they said , Thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh 's .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and he said , swear unto me . and he sware unto him . and Israel bowed himself upon the bed 's head .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Behold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
and said unto me , Behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and now thy two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath ; the same is Bethlehem .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
and Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn .
the Angel which redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Behold , I die : but God shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
and he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
and they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
and when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of Atad , they said , This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians : Wherefore the name of it was called Abel @-@ mizraim , which is beyond Jordan .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
and Joseph said unto them , Fear not : for am I in the place of God ?
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : I will nourish you , and your little ones . and he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
and the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's brink .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrews strove together : and he said to him that did the wrong , Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
and he said , Who made thee a prince and a judge over us ? intendest thou to kill me , as thou killedst the Egyptian ? and Moses feared , and said , Surely this thing is known .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
and he said unto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
and Moses said , I will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . and he said , Here am I.
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
and he said , Certainly I will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain .
and God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I will stretch out my hand , and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and Moses answered and said , But , behold , they will not believe me , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , The LORD hath not appeared unto thee .
and he said , Cast it on the ground . and he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
and the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ?
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the LORD said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
and the LORD said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . and he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kissed him .
and Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and afterward Moses and Aaron went in , and told Pharaoh , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness .
and Pharaoh said , Who is the LORD , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I know not the LORD , neither will I let Israel go .
and the tale of the bricks , which they did make heretofore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
but he said , Ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD .
and they said unto them , The LORD look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us .
and Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , Lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
then the LORD said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .
and I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the LORD .
go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and Moses spake before the LORD , saying , Behold , the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me ; how then shall Pharaoh hear me , who am of uncircumcised lips ?
and the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and the sons of Kohath ; Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel : and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Eleazar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the LORD said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
that the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , I am the LORD : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
and Moses said before the LORD , Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ?
but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the LORD had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
and he hardened Pharaoh 's heart , that he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh 's heart is hardened , he refuseth to let the people go .
and thou shalt say unto him , The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
thus saith the LORD , In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD : behold , I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments : and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD spake unto Moses , Go unto Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the LORD spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , Intreat the LORD , that he may take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD .
and Moses said unto Pharaoh , Glory over me : when shall I intreat for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?
and he said , To morrow . and he said , Be it according to thy word : that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , This is the finger of God : and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth .
and Pharaoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for me .
and Moses said , Behold , I go out from thee , and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , to morrow : but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD .
and the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
then the LORD said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh , and tell him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
behold , the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the LORD appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land .
and the LORD did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron , Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast .
and the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the LORD sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the LORD had spoken by Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh : for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might shew these my signs before him :
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son , and of thy son 's son , what things I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the LORD .
and Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
and Pharaoh 's servants said unto him , How long shall this man be a snare unto us ? let the men go , that they may serve the LORD their God : knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed ?
and Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD .
and he said unto them , Let the LORD be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the LORD ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste ; and he said , I have sinned against the LORD your God , and against you .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
and Pharaoh called unto Moses , and said , Go ye , serve the LORD ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
and Moses said , Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
and Moses said , Thus saith the LORD , About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt :
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh : and the LORD hardened Pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the LORD 's passover .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the LORD .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
and Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the LORD , as ye have said .
and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
and the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron , This is the ordinance of the passover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
sanctify unto me all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
and Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the LORD 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the LORD 's .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt .
and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him : for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you .
and the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD . and they did so .
and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled : and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ?
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .
and the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
and they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the LORD , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the angel of God , which went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behind them :
and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
and the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
and took off their chariot wheels , that they drave them heavily : so that the Egyptians said , Let us flee from the face of Israel ; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
the LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , O LORD , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
and Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
and Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
so Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and he cried unto the LORD ; and the LORD shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
and they came to Elim , where were twelve wells of water , and threescore and ten palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
and they took their journey from Elim , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
and Moses spake unto Aaron , Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , Come near before the LORD : for he hath heard your murmurings .
and when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is manna : for they wist not what it was . and Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat .
this is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , Gather of it every man according to his eating , an Omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
and Moses said , Eat that to day ; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
see , for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
and Moses said , This is the thing which the LORD commandeth , Fill an Omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
and the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chide ye with me ? Wherefore do ye tempt the LORD ?
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the chiding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the LORD , saying , Is the LORD among us , or not ?
and Moses said unto Joshua , Choose us out men , and go out , fight with Amalek : to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand .
so Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek : and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and her two sons ; of which the name of the one was Gershom ; for he said , I have been an alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other was Eliezer ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh :
and Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the LORD delivered them .
and Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
and Jethro said , Blessed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
and when Moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
when they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : be thou for the people to Godward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God :
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
so Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
and Moses went up unto God , and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
and Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , All that the LORD hath spoken we will do . and Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Lo , I come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and believe thee for ever . and Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled .
and the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
and let the priests also , which come near to the LORD , sanctify themselves , lest the LORD break forth upon them .
I am the LORD thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : Wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour 's .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
and if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free :
then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul ; and he shall serve him for ever .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and if men strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keepeth his bed :
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
and if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
whether he have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ;
and if one man 's ox hurt another 's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
if it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
and if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife .
and my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
and ye shall be holy men unto me : neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ; ye shall cast it to the dogs .
thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment :
if thou meet thine enemy 's ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
behold , I send an Angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days I will fulfil .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year ; lest the land become desolate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye afar off .
and Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the LORD hath said will we do .

speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .

and the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .

and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
see , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
and I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the LORD : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
and he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and the LORD said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
and Moses besought the LORD his God , and said , LORD , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , graven upon the tables .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
and Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
for Moses had said , consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
and Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sware unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , Unto thy seed will I give it :
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the LORD talked with Moses .
and the LORD spake unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
and I will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount .
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the LORD had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
and the LORD passed by before him , and proclaimed , The LORD , The LORD God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and he said , If now I have found grace in thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee , go among us ; for it is a stiffnecked people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for thine inheritance .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep . seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month Abib : for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem . and none shall appear before me empty .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
and he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
but when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him , he took the Vail off , until he came out . and he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the LORD : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
the candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
the hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the LORD 's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
and they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted , and brought bracelets , and earrings , and rings , and tablets , all jewels of gold : and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD .
and every man , with whom was found blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair , and red skins of rams , and Badgers ' skins , brought them .
and Moses said unto the children of Israel , See , the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ;
then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that the LORD had commanded .
and Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
and they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it withal . and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning .
and they spake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the LORD commanded to make .
and Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . so the people were restrained from bringing .
and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work made he them .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he made curtains of goats ' hair for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
one board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
and there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
and he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
and the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , to be set by the four corners of it ; even two rings upon the one side of it , and two rings upon the other side of it .
and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , to bear the ark .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch , a knop and a flower ; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch , a knop and a flower : so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick .
and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the holy anointing oil , and the pure incense of sweet spices , according to the work of the apothecary .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it withal ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : and twenty cubits was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cubits , answerable to the hangings of the court .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the Vail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the brasen altar , and the brasen grate for it , and all the vessels of the altar ,
and of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and the curious girdle of his ephod , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
and they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate .
and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
a bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO THE LORD .
and they brought the tabernacle unto Moses , the tent , and all his furniture , his taches , his boards , his bars , and his pillars , and his sockets ,
the pure candlestick , with the lamps thereof , even with the lamps to be set in order , and all the vessels thereof , and the oil for light ,
according to all that the LORD commanded Moses , so the children of Israel made all the work .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the LORD had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark :
and he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD ; as the LORD had commanded Moses .
and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal .
when they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
and the LORD called unto Moses , and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying ,
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD , ye shall bring your offering of the cattle , even of the herd , and of the flock .
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD .
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .
and if his offering be of the flocks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without blemish .
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and he shall cut it into his pieces , with his head and his fat : and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
and if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls , then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves , or of young pigeons .
and when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD , his offering shall be of fine flour ; and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frankincense thereon :
and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven , it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , or unleavened wafers anointed with oil .
and if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the LORD , shall be made with leaven : for ye shall burn no leaven , nor any honey , in any offering of the LORD made by fire .
and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
and the skin of the bullock , and all his flesh , with his head , and with his legs , and his inwards , and his dung ,
even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
and if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn him as he burned the first bullock : it is a sin offering for the congregation .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
or if a soul touch any unclean thing , whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast , or a carcase of unclean cattle , or the carcase of unclean creeping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be unclean , and guilty .
or if he touch the uncleanness of man , whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his trespass , which he hath committed , two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , unto the LORD ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
and the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these , and it shall be forgiven him : and the remnant shall be the priest 's , as a meat offering .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
if a soul sin , and commit a trespass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein :
then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein .
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it .
it shall not be baken with leaven . I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is baken , thou shalt bring it in : and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD .
and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the LORD , it shall be wholly burnt .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , saying , This is the law of the sin offering : in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD : it is most holy .
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
but the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken : and if it be sodden in a brasen pot , it shall be both scoured , and rinsed in water .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul that is above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away :
and the priest that offereth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that offereth it .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD , and it shall be the priest 's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
but if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow , or a voluntary offering , it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice : and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten :
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Ye shall eat no manner of fat , of ox , or of sheep , or of goat .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai .
take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the anointing oil , and a bullock for the sin offering , and two rams , and a basket of unleavened bread ;
and Moses did as the LORD commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he put the mitre upon his head ; also upon the mitre , even upon his forefront , did he put the golden plate , the holy crown ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all his vessels , both the laver and his foot , to sanctify them .
and he brought the bullock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
and he slew it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar , and sanctified it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consecration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he slew it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thumbs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
and he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
and Moses took the breast , and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consecration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations , as I commanded , saying , Aaron and his sons shall eat it .
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the LORD , that ye die not : for so I am commanded .
and he said unto Aaron , Take thee a young calf for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before the LORD .
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before the LORD ; and a meat offering mingled with oil : for to day the LORD will appear unto you .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Go unto the altar , and offer thy sin offering , and thy burnt offering , and make an atonement for thyself , and for the people : and offer the offering of the people , and make an atonement for them ; as the LORD commanded .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he slew the burnt offering ; and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled round about upon the altar .
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,
and Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people .
and there came a fire out from before the LORD , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
and Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy :
and Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying ,
Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the LORD ?
behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
and all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
these also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind ,
these are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
and every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are unclean , and shall be unclean unto you .
nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
for I am the LORD your God : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
for I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
this is the law of the beasts , and of the fowl , and of every living creature that moveth in the waters , and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth :
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean .
who shall offer it before the LORD , and make an atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
and if she be not able to bring a lamb , then she shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons ; the one for the burnt offering , and the other for a sin offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for her , and she shall be clean .
if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hairs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and if it spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague .
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
he shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more :
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the scall be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the scall is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in the warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of leprosy , and shall be shewed unto the priest :
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if the priest shall look , and , behold , the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ;
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof :
and the garment , either warp , or woof , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean .
this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen , either in the warp , or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish , and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , and one log of oil .
and the priest shall take one he lamb , and offer him for a trespass offering , and the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD :
and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the trespass offering : it is most holy :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD :
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass offering :
and two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
and he shall offer the one of the turtledoves , or of the young pigeons , such as he can get ;
when ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
and he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times :
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and the vessel of earth , that he toucheth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue .
and if any man 's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
but if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
this is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed goeth from him , and is defiled therewith ;
and the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron , when they offered before the LORD , and died ;
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the Vail :
and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the Vail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat :
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and cleanse it , and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD .
and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you , to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year . and he did as the LORD commanded Moses .
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring . this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , I am the LORD your God .
after the doings of the land of Egypt , wherein ye dwelt , shall ye not do : and after the doings of the land of Canaan , whither I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordinances .
none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : I am the LORD .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father 's brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to uncover her nakedness ; for they are her near kinswomen : it is wickedness .
also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness .
defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you :
and the land is defiled : therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants .
ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ; )
therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs , which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein : I am the LORD your God .
speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the LORD your God am holy .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the LORD your God .
and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD , ye shall offer it at your own will .
it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the morrow : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the LORD your God .
thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him .
thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : I am the LORD .
ye shall keep my statutes . thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the LORD your God .
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the LORD .
do not prostitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just Hin , shall ye have : I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
therefore shall ye observe all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : I am the LORD .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he giveth of his seed unto Molech , and kill him not :
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a whoring after him , to commit whoredom with Molech , from among their people .
and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
and the man that committeth adultery with another man 's wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour 's wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
and the man that lieth with his father 's wife hath uncovered his father 's nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man take a wife and her mother , it is wickedness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no wickedness among you .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall uncover her nakedness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
and thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother 's sister , nor of thy father 's sister : for he uncovereth his near kin : they shall bear their iniquity .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother 's nakedness ; they shall be childless .
ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither I bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I abhorred them .
but I have said unto you , Ye shall inherit their land , and I will give it unto you to possess it , a land that floweth with milk and honey : I am the LORD your God , which have separated you from other people .
and ye shall be holy unto me : for I the LORD am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron , and say unto them , There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people :
they shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the LORD , which sanctify you , am holy .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ;
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the LORD .
a widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the LORD .
what man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper , or hath a running issue ; he shall not eat of the holy things , until he be clean . and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead , or a man whose seed goeth from him ;
the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the priest 's daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the LORD ;
blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts , that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering ; but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
when a bullock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
on the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the LORD .
neither shall ye profane my holy name ; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel : I am the LORD which hallow you ,
six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest :
and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil , an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour : and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine , the fourth part of an Hin .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor parched corn , nor green ears , until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals : they shall be of fine flour ; they shall be baken with leaven ; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD .
then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering , and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
and ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the LORD your God .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of atonement , to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
ye shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
beside the sabbaths of the LORD , and beside your gifts , and beside all your vows , and beside all your freewill offerings , which ye give unto the LORD .
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
without the Vail of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually , being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant .
and it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute .
bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
and he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the LORD your God .
and Moses spake to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD .
six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the LORD : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
for it is the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy God : for I am the LORD your God .
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jubile .
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubile .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
but as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
for unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
and five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
I also will do this unto you ; I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me ; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
then will I also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven times for your sins .
and I will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
and I will make your cities waste , and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours .
and I will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be desolate , and your cities waste .
if they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity :
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
these are the statutes and judgments and laws , which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses .
and if it be a beast , whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD , all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy .
he shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valuest it , who art the priest , so shall it be .
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jubile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
but the field , when it goeth out in the jubile , shall be holy unto the LORD , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest 's .
only the firstling of the beasts , which should be the LORD 's firstling , no man shall sanctify it ; whether it be ox , or sheep : it is the LORD 's .
and concerning the tithe of the herd , or of the flock , even of whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD .
and the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tabernacle of the congregation , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
from twenty years old and upward , all that are able to go forth to war in Israel : thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies .
and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month , and they declared their pedigrees after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , by their polls .
these are those that were numbered , which Moses and Aaron numbered , and the princes of Israel , being twelve men : each one was for the house of his fathers .
so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
and when the tabernacle setteth forward , the Levites shall take it down : and when the tabernacle is to be pitched , the Levites shall set it up : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
but the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the ensign of their father 's house : far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred .
then the tribe of Zebulun : and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred .
all that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred .
then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp : as they encamp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and two thousand and two hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and five thousand and four hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty and one thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
all they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred . they shall go hindmost with their standards .
and Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD , when they offered strange fire before the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai , and they had no children : and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest 's office in the sight of Aaron their father .
bring the tribe of Levi near , and present them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister unto him .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons : they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .
in the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , were eight thousand and six hundred , keeping the charge of the sanctuary .
all that were numbered of the Levites , which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD , throughout their families , all the males from a month old and upward , were twenty and two thousand .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
and thou shalt give the money , wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed , unto Aaron and to his sons .
from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old , all that enter into the host , to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and when the camp setteth forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering Vail , and cover the ark of testimony with it :
and upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon :
and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet , and cover the same with a covering of Badgers ' skins , and shall put in the staves thereof .
and they shall take a cloth of blue , and cover the candlestick of the light , and his lamps , and his tongs , and his snuffdishes , and all the oil vessels thereof , wherewith they minister unto it :
and upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue , and cover it with a covering of Badgers ' skins , and shall put to the staves thereof :
and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , wherewith they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of Badgers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , wherewith they minister about it , even the censers , the fleshhooks , and the shovels , and the basons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of Badgers ' skins , and put to the staves of it .
this is the service of the families of the Gershonites , to serve , and for burdens :
and the hangings of the court , and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court , which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about , and their cords , and all the instruments of their service , and all that is made for them : so shall they serve .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation :
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the LORD spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the atonement , whereby an atonement shall be made for him .
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man 's wife go aside , and commit a trespass against him ,
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she be defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she be not defiled :
and the priest shall set the woman before the LORD , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
and the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , Amen , amen .
and the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the LORD , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation :
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
and he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
and he shall offer his offering unto the LORD , one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings ,
and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings .
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram , and one unleavened cake out of the basket , and one unleavened wafer , and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite , after the hair of his separation is shaven :
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD : this is holy for the priest , with the wave breast and heave shoulder : and after that the Nazarite may drink wine .
and they brought their offering before the LORD , six covered wagons , and twelve oxen ; a wagon for two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they brought them before the tabernacle .
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according unto their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but unto the sons of Kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and the LORD said unto Moses , They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedicating of the altar .

the golden spoons were twelve , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary : all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty shekels .
all the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks , the rams twelve , the lambs of the first year twelve , with their meat offering : and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve .
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites :
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may execute the service of the LORD .
and thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the LORD .
and after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation : and thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them for an offering .
for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
this is it that belongeth unto the Levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation :
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge .
and the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : Wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body , or be in a journey afar off , yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD .
they shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it .
so it was alway : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD , and journeyed not .
and so it was , when the cloud abode from even unto the morning , and that the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they journeyed : whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up , they journeyed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of Israel abode in their tents , and journeyed not : but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies : and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
and the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward , bearing the tabernacle .
and the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur .
and the Kohathites set forward , bearing the sanctuary : and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud .
thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and Moses said unto Hobab , the son of Raguel the Midianite , Moses ' father in law , We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said , I will give it you : come thou with us , and we will do thee good : for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel .
and he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred .
and he said , Leave us not , I pray thee ; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting : and the children of Israel also wept again , and said , Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick :
but our soul is dried away : there is nothing at all , beside this manna , before our eyes .
and the manna was as coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased .
whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto me , saying , Give us flesh , that we may eat .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in thy sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
and Moses said , The people , among whom I am , are six hundred thousand footmen ; and thou hast said , I will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
and the LORD said unto Moses , Is the LORD 's hand waxed short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
and the LORD came down in a cloud , and spake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chewed , the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people , and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague .
and they said , Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses ? hath he not spoken also by us ? and the LORD heard it .
and the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses , and unto Aaron , and unto Miriam , Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation . and they three came out .
and the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
and he said , Hear now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
with him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold : Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Miriam , and , behold , she was leprous .
and they came unto the brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
and all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
and Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
only rebel not ye against the LORD , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the LORD is with us : fear them not .
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones . and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel .
and the LORD said unto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ere they believe me , for all the signs which I have shewed among them ?
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
the LORD is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
say unto them , As truly as I live , saith the LORD , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will I do to you :
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the LORD have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the LORD .
and Moses said , Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD ? but it shall not prosper .
then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of oil .
and the fourth part of an Hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an Hin of oil .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the LORD :
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the LORD .
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD , and their sin offering before the LORD , for their ignorance :
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue :
I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the LORD your God .
and they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown :
seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
and he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD : and what is Aaron , that ye murmur against him ?
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up .
and Moses said unto Korah , Be thou and all thy company before the LORD , thou , and they , and Aaron , to morrow :
and take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also , and Aaron , each of you his censer .
and they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
and he spake unto the congregation , saying , Depart , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins .
so they Gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
but if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the congregation .
and there came out a fire from the LORD , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense .
the censers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar : for they offered them before the LORD , therefore they are hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel .
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye have killed the people of the LORD .
get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment . and they fell upon their faces .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the LORD ; the plague is begun .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Bring Aaron 's rod again before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the rebels ; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me , that they die not .
and the children of Israel spake unto Moses , saying , Behold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the LORD , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
and the LORD spake unto Aaron , Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou have any part among them : I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD , I have given to the Levites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus speak unto the Levites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD , even a tenth part of the tithe .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and upon which never came yoke :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times :
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
and why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , Hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and when we cried unto the LORD , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of Egypt : and , behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border :
and Edom said unto him , Thou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
and he said , Thou shalt not go through . and Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , journeyed from Kadesh , and came unto mount Hor .
and the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ,
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
and when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mourned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
and when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD , and said , If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities .
and the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hormah .
and the people spake against God , and against Moses , Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there is no bread , neither is there any water ; and our soul loatheth this light bread .
therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sinned , for we have spoken against the LORD , and against thee ; pray unto the LORD , that he take away the serpents from us . and Moses prayed for the people .
and from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
and from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon .
and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
and Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon : for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
we have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon , and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Fear him not : for I have delivered him into thy hand , and all his people , and his land ; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
and Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
and Moab said unto the elders of Midian , Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . and Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time .
and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
and he said unto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as the LORD shall speak unto me : and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and God said unto Balaam , Thou shalt not go with them ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they are blessed .
and Balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
and they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
for I will promote thee unto very great honour , and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me : come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
now therefore , I pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more .
and God came unto Balaam at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
but the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the angel of the LORD , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
and the LORD opened the mouth of the ass , and she said unto Balaam , What have I done unto thee , that thou hast smitten me these three times ?
and the ass said unto Balaam , Am not I thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day ? was I ever wont to do so unto thee ? and he said , Nay .
then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
and when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
and Balaam said unto Balak , Lo , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
and Balaam said unto Balak , Stand by thy burnt offering , and I will go : peradventure the LORD will come to meet me : and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee . and he went to an high place .
and the LORD put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , Return unto Balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
and he returned unto him , and , lo , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , he , and all the princes of Moab .
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
and when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . and Balak said unto him , What hath the LORD spoken ?
and he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor :
surely there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
and Balak said unto Balaam , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee unto another place ; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence .
and when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : I thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the LORD hath kept thee back from honour .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods : and the people did eat , and bowed down to their gods .
and Israel joined himself unto Baal @-@ peor : and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel .
and Moses said unto the judges of Israel , Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal @-@ peor .
Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was zealous for my sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an atonement for the children of Israel .
and the sons of Eliab ; Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . this is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the LORD :
and Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
these were the numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
and the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt : and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand , all males from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
for the LORD had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . and there was not left a man of them , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
and if his father have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment , as the LORD commanded Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Get thee up into this mount Abarim , and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel .
let the LORD , the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation ,
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering , mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even : as the meat offering of the morning , and as the drink offering thereof , thou shalt offer it , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
and a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , one ram , seven lambs of the first year ;
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering , to make an atonement for you :
and ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall afflict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks , two rams , fourteen lambs of the first year without spot :
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
these things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts , beside your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meat offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings .
and Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded .
and Moses spake unto the people , saying , Arm some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Midianites , and avenge the LORD of Midian .
so there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
and levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the LORD 's tribute was threescore and twelve .
and the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the LORD 's tribute was thirty and two persons .
we have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD , what every man hath gotten , of jewels of gold , chains , and bracelets , rings , earrings , and tablets , to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD .
Wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben , Shall your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them ?
for when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them .
and the LORD 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the LORD , was consumed .
for if ye turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and Moses said unto them , If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the LORD to war ,
and the land be subdued before the LORD : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the LORD , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD .
build you cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
and the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses , saying , Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of Gilead :
and Moses said unto them , If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan , every man armed to battle , before the LORD , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession :
and the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , As the LORD hath said unto thy servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours .
and Nebo , and Baal @-@ meon , ( their names being changed , ) and Shibmah : and gave other names unto the cities which they builded .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
and they removed from Marah , and came unto Elim : and in Elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there .
and they removed from Kadesh , and pitched in mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
and Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for I have given you the land to possess it .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof : )
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom , and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward :
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh @-@ barnea , and shall go on to Hazar @-@ addar , and pass on to Azmon :
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .
and the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar @-@ enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down to Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe :
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun .
and the names of the men are these : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
and the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan ;
ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him .
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was anointed with the holy oil .
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land CANNOT be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
and when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD , saying , The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well .
this is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
for Mahlal , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their father 's brothers ' sons :
and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the judgments , which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
these be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the Red sea , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .
and I spake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone :
so I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
and I charged your judges at that time , saying , Hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between every man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him .
and when we departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites , as the LORD our God commanded us ; and we came to Kadesh @-@ barnea .
and I said unto you , Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which the LORD our God doth give unto us .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us .
and ye murmured in your tents , and said , Because the LORD hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
whither shall we go up ? our brethren have discouraged our heart , saying , The people is greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and walled up to heaven ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
but Joshua the son of Nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
so I spake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD , and went presumptuously up into the hill .
and ye returned and wept before the LORD ; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , through the way of the plain from Elath , and from Ezion @-@ gaber , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
the Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ;
the Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime ; but the children of Esau succeeded them , when they had destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead ; as Israel did unto the land of his possession , which the LORD gave unto them .
( that also was accounted a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in old time ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims ;
and the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon : behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
from Aroer , which is by the brink of the river of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the LORD our God delivered all unto us :
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
all the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salchah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi ; and called them after his own name , Bashan @-@ havoth @-@ Jair , unto this day .
the plain also , and Jordan , and the coast thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under Ashdoth @-@ pisgah eastward .
I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon .
but the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me : and the LORD said unto me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
get thee up into the top of Pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes : for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
now therefore hearken , O Israel , unto the statutes and unto the judgments , which I teach you , for to do them , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you .
ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you .
and ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
and the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
and he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire :
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God , which he made with you , and make you a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee .
and the LORD shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the LORD shall lead you .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the LORD thy God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the LORD he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God giveth thee , for ever .
namely , Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
on this side Jordan , in the valley over against Beth @-@ peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote , after they were come forth out of Egypt :
and they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ;
and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of Pisgah .
and Moses called all Israel , and said unto them , Hear , O Israel , the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
the LORD made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
the LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood between the LORD and you at that time , to shew you the work of the LORD : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
and the LORD heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the LORD said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
but as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it .
ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
and it shall be , when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give thee great and goodly cities , which thou buildedst not ,
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers ,
and the LORD shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
for they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven images with fire .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God : the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
the LORD did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
but because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers :
and the LORD will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh , and unto all Egypt ;
moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein : for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God .
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
but thou shalt remember the LORD thy God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
a people great and tall , the children of the Anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of Anak !
understand therefore this day , that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the LORD hath said unto thee .
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the LORD .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the LORD said unto me , Arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
and I fell down before the LORD , as at the first , forty days and forty nights : I did neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all your sins which ye sinned , in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you . but the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also .
and at Taberah , and at Massah , and at Kibroth @-@ hattaavah , ye provoked the LORD to wrath .
thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first ; because the LORD had said he would destroy you .
I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GOD , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
at that time the LORD said unto me , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an ark of wood .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the LORD gave them unto me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and the LORD said unto me , Arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
thou shalt fear the LORD thy God ; him shalt thou serve , and to him shalt thou cleave , and swear by his name .
thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons ; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
a land which the LORD thy God careth for : the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and then the LORD 's wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you .
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house , and upon thy gates :
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them , as the days of heaven upon the earth .
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you , to do them , to love the LORD your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ;
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow their altars , and break their pillars , and burn their groves with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
but unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heave offerings of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks :
and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee .
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest :
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
even as the Roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the LORD thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God .
ye shall walk after the LORD your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cleave unto him .
but thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
and all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
certain men , the children of Belial , are gone out from among you , and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , which ye have not known ;
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God , and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the Coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they are unclean unto you .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose :
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD 's release .
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the LORD thy God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God .
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the Roebuck , and as the hart .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God : for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night .
thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there .
but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tents .
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are within thy gates .
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the LORD his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God , as all his brethren the Levites do , which stand there before the LORD .
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD : and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee .
the LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
according to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken , but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously : thou shalt not be afraid of him .
when the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations , whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
and this is the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ;
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them , which I command thee this day , to love the LORD thy God , and to walk ever in his ways ; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee , beside these three :
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the Avenger of blood , that he may die .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall say unto them , Hear , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
for the LORD your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you agginst your enemies , to save you .
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart faint as well as his heart .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
and when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee :
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
be merciful , O LORD , unto thy people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel 's charge . and the blood shall be forgiven them .
if a man have two wives , one beloved , and another hated , and they have born him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of thy vineyard , be defiled .
and , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity . and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
but if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel :
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD .
an Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever :
thou shalt not abhor an Edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian ; because thou wast a stranger in his land .
thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
when thou comest into thy neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way , after that ye were come forth out of Egypt .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger , nor of the fatherless ; nor take a widow 's raiment to pledge :
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
when thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands .
when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
if there be a controversy between men , and they come unto judgment , that the judges may judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked .
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets :
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
therefore it shall be , when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about , in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
and it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the LORD thy God , that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us .
and thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God , A Syrian ready to perish was my father , and he went down into Egypt , and sojourned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous :
and when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers , the LORD heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O LORD , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
this day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice :
and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God , as he hath spoken .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over , that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , a land that floweth with milk and honey ; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God :
and Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel , saying , Take heed , and hearken , O Israel ; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God .
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
these shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image , an abomination unto the LORD , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and putteth it in a secret place . and all the people shall answer and say , Amen .
cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that removeth his neighbour 's landmark . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger , fatherless , and widow . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
the LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , and walk in his ways .
and the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
the LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
the LORD shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that CANNOT be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
and thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , THE LORD THY GOD ;
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the LORD bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God .
and the LORD shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
these are the words of the covenant , which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
and I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot .
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee ,
and shalt return unto the LORD thy God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thine heart , and with all thy soul ;
that then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee .
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
and the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
and the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
and the LORD shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the LORD thy God , he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and the LORD , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
and Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacles ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and the LORD said unto Moses , Behold , thy days approach that thou must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge . and Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for I know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck : behold , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebellious against the LORD ; and how much more after my death ?
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
give ear , O ye heavens , and I will speak ; and hear , O earth , the words of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
do ye thus requite the LORD , O foolish people and unwise ? is not he thy father that hath bought thee ? hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
he found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
but Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter :
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
see now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
if I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will avenge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be merciful unto his land , and to his people .
and Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hoshea the son of Nun .
and he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
and he was king in Jeshurun , when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together .
and this is the blessing of Judah : and he said , Hear , LORD , the voice of Judah , and bring him unto his people : let his hands be sufficient for him ; and be thou an help to him from his enemies .
and of Levi he said , Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one , whom thou didst prove at Massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah ;
they shall teach Jacob thy judgments , and Israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
and of Dan he said , Dan is a lion 's whelp : he shall leap from Bashan .
and of Asher he said , Let Asher be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
there is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in his excellency on the sky .
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
happy art thou , O Israel : who is like unto thee , O people saved by the LORD , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excellency ! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon their high places .
and the LORD said unto him , This is the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto thy seed : I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
and the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended .
and Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hearkened unto him , and did as the LORD commanded Moses .
in all the signs and the wonders , which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel .
Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give them .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
have not I commanded thee ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , saying , The LORD your God hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
your wives , your little ones , and your cattle , shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan ; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed , all the mighty men of valour , and help them ;
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and it was told the king of Jericho , saying , Behold , there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country .
and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the Fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
and she said unto the men , I know that the LORD hath given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
for we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you , when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites , that were on the other side Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom ye utterly destroyed .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the LORD , since I have shewed you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father 's house , and give me a true token :
and she said unto them , Get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
and they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Joshua said unto the people , Sanctify yourselves : for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that , as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua said unto the children of Israel , Come hither , and hear the words of the LORD your God .
and Joshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water , ( for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man :
and Joshua said unto them , Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel :
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan , until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua : and the people hasted and passed over .
on that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , in the east border of Jericho .
and he spake unto the children of Israel , saying , When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , What mean these stones ?
for the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the LORD your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD , that it is mighty : that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever .
at that time the LORD said unto Joshua , Make thee sharp knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time .
and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised : for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them by the way .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day .
and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho .
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
and he said , Nay ; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come . and Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , What saith my lord unto his servant ?
and the captain of the LORD 's host said unto Joshua , Loose thy shoe from off thy foot ; for the place whereon thou standest is holy . and Joshua did so .
and Joshua the son of Nun called the priests , and said unto them , Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the LORD .
and he said unto the people , Pass on , and compass the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , Joshua said unto the people , Shout ; for the LORD hath given you the city .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD .
and Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Beth @-@ Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed Ai .
and the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men : for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim , and smote them in the going down : Wherefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accursed : neither will I be with you any more , except ye destroy the accursed from among you .
up , sanctify the people , and say , Sanctify yourselves against to morrow : for thus saith the LORD God of Israel , There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemies , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
so Joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought Israel by their tribes ; and the tribe of Judah was taken :
and he brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
and Joshua said unto Achan , My son , give , I pray thee , glory to the LORD God of Israel , and make confession unto him ; and tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me .
and Achan answered Joshua , and said , Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done :
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day . so the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger . Wherefore the name of that place was called , The valley of Achor , unto this day .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against Ai : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
and he commanded them , saying , Behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
then ye shall rise up from the ambush , and seize upon the city : for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai ; for I will give it into thine hand . and Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and slew the men of Ai .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of whole stones , over which no man hath lift up any iron : and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD , and sacrificed peace offerings .
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and the men of Israel said unto the Hivites , Peradventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel . and all the congregation murmured against the princes .
and Joshua called for them , and he spake unto them , saying , Wherefore have ye beguiled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye dwell among us ?
now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
that they feared greatly , because Gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than Ai , and all the men thereof were mighty .
come up unto me , and help me , that we may smite Gibeon : for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel .
and the LORD discomfited them before Israel , and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth @-@ horon , and smote them to Azekah , and unto Makkedah .
and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
then said Joshua , Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave .
and Joshua said unto them , Fear not , nor be dismayed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
and afterward Joshua smote them , and slew them , and hanged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
and they took it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Be not afraid because of them : for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel : thou shalt Hough their horses , and burn their chariots with fire .
and Joshua at that time turned back , and took Hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword : for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms .
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe : and he burnt Hazor with fire .
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Hazor only ; that did Joshua burn .
so Joshua took all that land , the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of Goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and the valley of the same ;
even from the mount Halak , that goeth up to Seir , even unto Baal @-@ gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon : and all their kings he took , and smote them , and slew them .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon : all other they took in battle .
and at that time came Joshua , and cut off the Anakims from the mountains , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountains of Judah , and from all the mountains of Israel : Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities .
there was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the LORD said unto Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . and the land rested from war .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon , and all the plain on the east :
and from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east , and unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea on the east , the way to Beth @-@ jeshimoth ; and from the south , under Ashdoth @-@ pisgah :
and the coast of Og king of Bashan , which was of the remnant of the giants , that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
and reigned in mount Hermon , and in Salcah , and in all Bashan , unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
in the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ;
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites , nor the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
and their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
and Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families .
and their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
and their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities :
but unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance : the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance , as he said unto them .
for Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them .
and the name of Hebron before was Kirjath @-@ arba ; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims . and the land had rest from war .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ Arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ Shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
and Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath @-@ Sepher .
who answered , Give me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and he gave her the upper springs , and the nether springs .
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel , and Eder , and Jagur ,
and Lebaoth , and Shilhim , and Ain , and Rimmon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages :
as for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out : but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho , unto the water of Jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel ,
and goeth out from Bethel to Luz , and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth ,
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti , unto the coast of Beth @-@ horon the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ Shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth , and to Naarath , and came to Jericho , and went out at Jordan .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
and they came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying , The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren . therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
and there fell ten portions to Manasseh , beside the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side Jordan ;
and the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En @-@ tappuah .
now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah : but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim ;
yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
and the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
but the mountain shall be thine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the outgoings of it shall be thine : for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they be strong .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the description hither to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God .
but the Levites have no part among you ; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance : and Gad , and Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh , have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them .
and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD : and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Ataroth @-@ adar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth @-@ horon .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ Shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Beth @-@ hoglah , and the valley of Keziz ,
and Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath @-@ beer , Ramath of the south . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and their border went up toward the sea , and Maralah , and reached to Dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before Jokneam ;
and from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah @-@ hepher , to Ittah @-@ kazin , and goeth out to Remmon @-@ methoar to Neah ;
and the coast reacheth to Tabor , and Shahazimah , and Beth @-@ Shemesh ; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and then the coast turneth westward to Aznoth @-@ Tabor , and goeth out from thence to Hukkok , and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side , and reacheth to Asher on the west side , and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
according to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnath @-@ serah in mount Ephraim : and he built the city , and dwelt therein .
and they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali , and Shechem in mount Ephraim , and Kirjath @-@ arba , which is Hebron , in the mountain of Judah .
and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattle .
and the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the LORD , these cities and their suburbs .
and the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
and the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
all the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
for they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Gezer with her suburbs ,
and out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Hammoth @-@ DOR with her suburbs , and Kartan with her suburbs ; three cities .
and out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer with her suburbs , and Jahazah with her suburbs ,
and the LORD gave them rest round about , according to all that he sware unto their fathers : and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand .
and said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
and now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren , as he promised them : therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents , and unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan .
now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD ,
the LORD God of gods , the LORD God of gods , he knoweth , and Israel he shall know ; if it be in rebellion , or if in transgression against the LORD , ( save us not this day , )
for the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Reuben and children of Gad ; ye have no part in the LORD : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD .
God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD , and turn this day from following the LORD , to build an altar for burnt offerings , for meat offerings , or for sacrifices , beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle .
and when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
and the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and did not intend to go up against them in battle , to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt .
and it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age .
and Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , I am old and stricken in age :
and ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you .
behold , I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even unto the great sea westward .
and the LORD your God , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the LORD your God hath promised unto you .
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them : and afterward I brought you out .
and I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and I sent the hornet before you , which drave them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and the LORD drave out from before us all the people , even the Amorites which dwelt in the land : therefore will we also serve the LORD ; for he is our God .
and Joshua said unto the people , Ye CANNOT serve the LORD : for he is an holy God ; he is a jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
if ye forsake the LORD , and serve strange gods , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
and Joshua said unto the people , Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD , to serve him . and they said , We are witnesses .
and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD .
and Joshua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God .
and Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the LORD , that he had done for Israel .
and Judah said unto Simeon his brother , Come up with me into my lot , that we may fight against the Canaanites ; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot . so Simeon went with him .
and they found Adoni @-@ Bezek in Bezek : and they fought against him , and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
and Adoni @-@ Bezek said , threescore and ten kings , having their thumbs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meat under my table : as I have done , so God hath requited me . and they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
and afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron : ( now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath @-@ arba : ) and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath @-@ Sepher :
and she said unto him , Give me a blessing : for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs .
and the LORD was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
and the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel : and the LORD was with them .
and the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel . ( now the name of the city before was Luz . )
and the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called the name thereof Luz : which is the name thereof unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ?
Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
and the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the LORD , that he did for Israel .
and Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the LORD to anger .
and the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the LORD was against them for evil , as the LORD had said , and as the LORD had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the LORD ; but they did not so .
and when the LORD raised them up judges , then the LORD was with the judge , and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them .
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
now these are the nations which the LORD left , to prove Israel by them , even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan ;
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ;
namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal @-@ Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
and they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
and the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites , and Jebusites :
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD , and forgat the LORD their God , and served Baalim and the groves .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan @-@ rishathaim .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD .
and he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
but Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret errand unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . and all that stood by him went out from him .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
then Ehud went forth through the porch , and shut the doors of the parlour upon him , and locked them .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
and he said unto them , Follow after me : for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . and they went down after him , and took the Fords of Jordan toward Moab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
and they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
so Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . and the land had rest fourscore years .
and after him was Shamgar the son of Anath , which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad : and he also delivered Israel .
and the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD , when Ehud was dead .
and the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , that reigned in Hazor ; the captain of whose host was Sisera , which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
and Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lapidoth , she judged Israel at that time .
and Barak said unto her , If thou wilt go with me , then I will go : but if thou wilt not go with me , then I will not go .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
and Deborah said unto Barak , Up ; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand : is not the LORD gone out before thee ? so Barak went down from mount Tabor , and ten thousand men after him .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
and Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
and he said unto her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
again he said unto her , Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and inquire of thee , and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No .
and the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
Lord , when thou wentest out of Seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
my heart is toward the governors of Israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . bless ye the LORD .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
the kings came and fought , then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo ; they took no gain of money .
the river of Kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river Kishon . O my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
curse ye Meroz , said the angel of the LORD , curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the LORD , to the help of the LORD against the mighty .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
the mother of Sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice , Why is his chariot so long in coming ? why tarry the wheels of his chariots ?
so let all thine enemies perish , O LORD : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might . and the land had rest forty years .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites ; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and I said unto you , I am the LORD your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
and there came an angel of the LORD , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abi @-@ ezrite : and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
and the LORD looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites : have not I sent thee ?
and he said unto him , Oh my Lord , wherewith shall I save Israel ? behold , my family is poor in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father 's house .
depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
and the angel of God said unto him , Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth . and he did so .
and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD , Gideon said , Alas , O Lord GOD ! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face .
then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD , and called it Jehovah @-@ Shalom : unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi @-@ ezrites .
and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
and they said one to another , Who hath done this thing ? and when they inquired and asked , they said , Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing .
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pitched in the valley of Jezreel .
but the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and Abi @-@ Ezer was gathered after him .
and he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto Asher , and unto Zebulun , and unto Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
behold , I will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pitched beside the well of Harod : so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gilead . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
and the LORD said unto Gideon , By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
so the people took victuals in their hand , and their trumpets : and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and his fellow answered and said , This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel : for into his hand hath God delivered Midian , and all the host .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
and the three companies blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal : and they cried , The sword of the LORD , and of Gideon .
and the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the LORD set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @-@ shittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abel @-@ meholah , unto Tabbath .
and the men of Ephraim said unto him , Why hast thou served us thus , that thou calledst us not , when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites ? and they did chide with him sharply .
and he said unto them , What have I done now in comparison of you ? is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi @-@ Ezer ?
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb : and what was I able to do in comparison of you ? then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
and the princes of Succoth said , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna , What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor ? and they answered , As thou art , so were they ; each one resembled the children of a king .
and Gideon made an ephod thereof , and put it in his city , even in Ophrah : and all Israel went thither a whoring after it : which thing became a snare unto Gideon , and to his house .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abi @-@ ezrites .
and the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , namely , Gideon , according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel .
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal @-@ berith , wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
and he went unto his father 's house at Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hearken unto me , ye men of Shechem , that God may hearken unto you .
but the olive tree said unto them , Should I leave my fatness , wherewith by me they honour God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
but the fig tree said unto them , Should I forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
and the bramble said unto the trees , If in truth ye anoint me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
( for my father fought for you , and adventured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ; )
but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech .
and the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and cursed Abimelech .
and when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
and Abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
and Gaal spake again and said , See there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim .
then said Zebul unto him , Where is now thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst , Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? is not this the people that thou hast despised ? go out , I pray now , and fight with them .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smote them .
and Abimelech , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
and Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people that was therein , and beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
and Abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer , and said unto him , Draw thy sword , and slay me , that men say not of me , A woman slew him . and his young man thrust him through , and he died .
and all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
and after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim .
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel : eighteen years , all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was sore distressed .
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , saying , We have sinned against thee , both because we have forsaken our God , and also served Baalim .
the Zidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , did oppress you ; and ye cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the LORD : and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
and Gilead 's wife bare him sons ; and his wife 's sons grew up , and they thrust out Jephthah , and said unto him , Thou shalt not inherit in our father 's house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and they said unto Jephthah , Come , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of Ammon .
and Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , Did not ye hate me , and expel me out of my father 's house ? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , Therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
and Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon , and the LORD deliver them before me , shall I be your head ?
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , The LORD be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
and Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said unto him , Let us pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place .
and the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smote them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
and now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
Wherefore I have not sinned against thee , but thou doest me wrong to war against me : the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon .
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
and it came to pass at the end of two months , that she returned unto her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she knew no man . and it was a custom in Israel ,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
and Jephthah said unto them , I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the LORD delivered them into my hand : Wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead , and fought with Ephraim : and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim , because they said , Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites , and among the Manassites .
and the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites : and it was so , that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said , Let me go over ; that the men of Gilead said unto him , Art thou an Ephraimite ? if he said , Nay ;
and Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of the Amalekites .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
and there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no rasor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
but he said unto me , Behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death .
then Manoah intreated the LORD , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
and Manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said unto him , Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman ? and he said , I am .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Though thou detain me , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the LORD . for Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD .
and Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD , What is thy name , that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour ?
so Manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD : and the angel did wondrously ; and Manoah and his wife looked on .
but his wife said unto him , If the LORD were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these .
and the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol .
and Samson went down to Timnath , and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion .
so his father went down unto the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
and Samson said unto them , I will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments :
but if ye CANNOT declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments . and they said unto him , Put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
and he said unto them , Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . and they could not in three days expound the riddle .
and she wept before him the seven days , while their feast lasted : and it came to pass on the seventh day , that he told her , because she lay sore upon him : and she told the riddle to the children of her people .
and her father said , I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to thy companion : is not her younger sister fairer than she ? take her , I pray thee , instead of her .
and Samson said concerning them , Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines , though I do them a displeasure .
then the Philistines said , Who hath done this ? and they answered , Samson , the son in law of the Timnite , because he had taken his wife , and given her to his companion . and the Philistines came up , and burnt her and her father with fire .
and Samson said unto them , Though ye have done this , yet will I be avenged of you , and after that I will cease .
and the men of Judah said , Why are ye come up against us ? and they answered , To bind Samson are we come up , to do to him as he hath done to us .
and they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines . and Samson said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and they spake unto him , saying , No ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee . and they bound him with two new cords , and brought him up from the rock .
and when he came unto Lehi , the Philistines shouted against him : and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him , and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire , and his bands loosed from off his hands .
and he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
and he was sore athirst , and called on the LORD , and said , Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
and Delilah said to Samson , Tell me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
and Samson said unto her , If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and Delilah said unto Samson , Behold , thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : now tell me , I pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
and she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
and she said , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson . and he awoke out of his sleep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he wist not that the LORD was departed from him .
but the Philistines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grind in the prison house .
then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that beheld while Samson made sport .
and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying place of Manoah his father . and he judged Israel twenty years .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a graven image and a molten image : and they were in the house of Micah .
and the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
and Micah said unto him , whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah , and I go to sojourn where I may find a place .
and they said unto him , Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for God hath given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth .
and they went up , and pitched in Kirjath @-@ jearim , in Judah : Wherefore they called that place Mahaneh @-@ dan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kirjath @-@ jearim .
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish , and said unto their brethren , Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod , and teraphim , and a graven image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
and these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image . then said the priest unto them , What do ye ?
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them .
and he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?
and the children of Dan said unto him , Let not thy voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the lives of thy household .
and they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : Howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the graven image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him unto her father 's house to Bethlehemjudah , and was there four whole months .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
and they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
and he said unto him , We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim ; from thence am I : and I went to Bethlehemjudah , but I am now going to the house of the LORD ; and there is no man that receiveth me to house .
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which is with thy servants : there is no want of any thing .
and the old man said , Peace be with thee ; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
behold , here is my daughter a maiden , and his concubine ; them I will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
and he said unto her , Up , and let us be going . but none answered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and Gat him unto his place .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the congregation was gathered together as one man , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , with the land of Gilead , unto the LORD in Mizpeh .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh . ) Then said the children of Israel , Tell us , how was this wickedness ?
and the men of Gibeah rose against me , and beset the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have slain me : and my concubine have they forced , that she is dead .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
and the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , What wickedness is this that is done among you ?
and the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword , beside the inhabitants of Gibeah , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
( and the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even , and asked counsel of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? and the LORD said , Go up against him . )
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of God , and wept , and sat there before the LORD , and fasted that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
and the children of Benjamin said , They are smitten down before us , as at the first . but the children of Israel said , Let us flee , and draw them from the city unto the highways .
and the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel : and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah .
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon : and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men ; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom , and slew two thousand men of them .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh , saying , There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife .
and said , O LORD God of Israel , why is this come to pass in Israel , that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel ?
and the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ?
and they said , What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD ? and , behold , there came none to the camp from Jabesh @-@ Gilead to the assembly .
and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest , and commanded them , saying , Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ Gilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children .
and this is the thing that ye shall do , Ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon , and to call peaceably unto them .
then the elders of the congregation said , How shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ?
and they said , There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin .
then they said , Behold , there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah .
therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ;
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . and a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
and the name of the man was Elimelech , and the name of his wife Naomi , and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah . and they came into the country of Moab , and continued there .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
and Naomi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the LORD deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . and it came to pass , when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Naomi ?
I went out full , and the LORD hath brought me home again empty : why then call ye me Naomi , seeing the LORD hath testified against me , and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech ; and his name was Boaz .
and Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi , Let me now go to the field , and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace . and she said unto her , Go , my daughter .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her HAP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said unto the reapers , The LORD be with you . and they answered him , The LORD bless thee .
and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said , It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab :
and she said , I pray you , let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house .
then said Boaz unto Ruth , Hearest thou not , my daughter ? go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maidens :
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and Boaz said unto her , At mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . and she sat beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corn , and she did eat , and was sufficed , and left .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and Ruth the Moabitess said , He said unto me also , Thou shalt keep fast by my young men , until they have ended all my harvest .
and Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law , It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
then Naomi her mother in law said unto her , My daughter , shall I not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
and she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law bade her .
and when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , Who art thou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
then said she , Sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finished the thing this day .
then went Boaz up to the gate , and sat him down there : and , behold , the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by ; unto whom he said , Ho , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here . and he turned aside , and sat down .
and he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , Sit ye down here . and they sat down .
then said Boaz , What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi , thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and the women said unto Naomi , Blessed be the LORD , which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman , that his name may be famous in Israel .
and the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Naomi ; and they called his name Obed : he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim @-@ zophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephrathite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh . and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of the LORD , were there .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the LORD , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD .
and Hannah answered and said , No , my lord , I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit : I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before the LORD .
and the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
but Hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the LORD , and there abide for ever .
and when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh : and the child was young .
talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for the LORD is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
also before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the LORD 's people to transgress .
and there came a man of God unto Eli , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father , when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
and the man of thine , whom I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eyes , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli . and the word of the LORD was precious in those days ; there was no open vision .
and the LORD called Samuel again the third time . and he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me . and Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child .
therefore Eli said unto Samuel , Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speak , LORD ; for thy servant heareth . so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
and the LORD said to Samuel , Behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
and therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Eli 's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
and Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the LORD . and Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision .
and the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
woe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods ? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
be strong , and quit yourselves like men , O ye Philistines , that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews , as they have been to you : quit yourselves like men , and fight .
and the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
and when he came , lo , Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching : for his heart trembled for the ark of God . and when the man came into the city , and told it , all the city cried out .
and the man said unto Eli , I am he that came out of the army , and I fled to day out of the army . and he said , What is there done , my son ?
and the messenger answered and said , Israel is fled before the Philistines , and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God is taken .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , Fear not ; for thou hast born a son . but she answered not , neither did she regard it .
and she named the child I @-@ chabod , saying , The glory is departed from Israel : because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband .
and when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD . and they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any that come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day .
but the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod , and he destroyed them , and smote them with emerods , even Ashdod and the coasts thereof .
and the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , What shall we do to the ark of the LORD ? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place .
then said they , What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him ? they answered , Five golden emerods , and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the Philistines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and take the ark of the LORD , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which ye return him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
and when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
and the men of Beth @-@ Shemesh said , Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God ? and to whom shall he go up from us ?
and it came to pass , while the ark abode in Kirjath @-@ jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD .
then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth , and served the LORD only .
and they gathered together to Mizpeh , and drew water , and poured it out before the LORD , and fasted on that day , and said there , We have sinned against the LORD . and Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel : but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were smitten before Israel .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
and his return was to Ramah ; for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel ; and there he built an altar unto the LORD .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abiah : they were judges in Beer @-@ sheba .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
now therefore hearken unto their voice : Howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them , and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the LORD will not hear you in that day .
nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel ; and they said , Nay ; but we will have a king over us ;
that we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and the asses of Kish Saul 's father were lost . and Kish said to Saul his son , Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
and when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
then said Saul to his servant , But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God : what have we ?
then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go . so they went unto the city where the man of God was .
and as they went up the hill to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said unto them , Is the seer here ?
and they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make haste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Behold the man whom I spake to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , where the seer 's house is .
and Samuel answered Saul , and said , I am the seer : go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me to day , and to morrow I will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in thine heart .
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not thy mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said , Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine :
and the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
and let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
and thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal ; and , behold , I will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seven days shalt thou tarry , till I come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt do .
and it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
and when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ?
and Saul 's uncle said unto him and to his servant , whither went ye ? and he said , To seek the asses : and when we saw that they were no where , we came to Samuel .
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
therefore they inquired of the LORD further , if the man should yet come thither . and the LORD answered , Behold , he hath hid himself among the stuff .
and they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
and Samuel said to all the people , See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? and all the people shouted , and said , God save the king .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then Nahash the Ammonite came up , and encamped against Jabesh @-@ Gilead : and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash , Make a covenant with us , and we will serve thee .
and Nahash the Ammonite answered them , On this condition will I make a covenant with you , that I may thrust out all your right eyes , and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel .
and the elders of Jabesh said unto him , Give us seven days ' respite , that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel : and then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee .
and , behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field ; and Saul said , What aileth the people that they weep ? and they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh .
and when he numbered them in Bezek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , To morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you .
and the people said unto Samuel , Who is he that said , Shall Saul reign over us ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
and Saul said , There shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel .
and all the people went to Gilgal ; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal ; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly .
and now , behold , the king walketh before you : and I am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
and he said unto them , The LORD is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . and they answered , He is witness .
and Samuel said unto the people , It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD , which he did to you and to your fathers .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the LORD , then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
and when they forgat the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
and they cried unto the LORD , and said , We have sinned , because we have forsaken the LORD , and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the LORD hath set a king over you .
if ye will fear the LORD , and serve him , and obey his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God :
and all the people said unto Samuel , Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
and Samuel said unto the people , Fear not : ye have done all this wickedness : yet turn not aside from following the LORD , but serve the LORD with all your heart ;
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which CANNOT profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
for the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people .
moreover as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you : but I will teach you the good and the right way :
and Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it . and Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , Let the Hebrews hear .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude : and they came up , and pitched in Michmash , eastward from Beth @-@ Aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
and Samuel said , What hast thou done ? and Saul said , Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that thou camest not within the days appointed , and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash ;
therefore said I , The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal , and I have not made supplication unto the LORD : I forced myself therefore , and offered a burnt offering .
and Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God , which he commanded thee : for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever .
and Samuel arose , and Gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin . and Saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
and Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , abode in Gibeah of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel : for the Philistines said , Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears :
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines , to sharpen every man his share , and his coulter , and his axe , and his mattock .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
and Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
and Ahiah , the son of Ahitub , I @-@ chabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the LORD 's priest in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
but if they say thus , Come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , Behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled , and the earth quaked : so it was a very great trembling .
then said Saul unto the people that were with him , Number now , and see who is gone from us . and when they had numbered , behold , Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there .
and it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said unto the priest , Withdraw thine hand .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
and the men of Israel were distressed that day : for Saul had adjured the people , saying , Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening , that I may be avenged on mine enemies . so none of the people tasted any food .
and when the people were come into the wood , behold , the honey dropped ; but no man put his hand to his mouth : for the people feared the oath .
but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : Wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and dipped it in an honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then answered one of the people , and said , Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath , saying , Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day . and the people were faint .
then said Jonathan , My father hath troubled the land : see , I pray you , how mine eyes have been enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
then they told Saul , saying , Behold , the people sin against the LORD , in that they eat with the blood . and he said , Ye have transgressed : roll a great stone unto me this day .
and Saul built an altar unto the LORD : the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD .
and Saul said , Draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people : and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day .
and Saul answered , God do so and more also : for thou shalt surely die , Jonathan .
and he gathered an host , and smote the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishui , and Melchi @-@ Shua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and Saul said unto the Kenites , Go , depart , get you down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them : for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel , when they came up out of Egypt . so the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
and Samuel came to Saul : and Saul said unto him , Blessed be thou of the LORD : I have performed the commandment of the LORD .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
then Samuel said unto Saul , Stay , and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night . and he said unto him , Say on .
and Samuel said , When thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel ?
but the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal .
and Saul said unto Samuel , I have sinned : for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD , and thy words : because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD .
and as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
then he said , I have sinned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
then said Samuel , Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites . and Agag came unto him delicately . and Agag said , Surely the bitterness of death is past .
and Samuel said , How can I go ? if Saul hear it , he Will kill me . and the LORD said , Take an heifer with thee , and say , I am come to sacrifice to the LORD .
and he said , peaceably : I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD : sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . and he sanctified Jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
and it came to pass , when they were come , that he looked on Eliab , and said , Surely the LORD 's anointed is before him .
but the LORD said unto Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for the LORD seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the LORD looketh on the heart .
again , Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel . and Samuel said unto Jesse , The LORD hath not chosen these .
and he sent , and brought him in . now he was ruddy , and withal of a beautiful countenance , and goodly to look to . and the LORD said , Arise , anoint him : for this is he .
then Samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
and Saul sent to Jesse , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
and it came to pass , when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took an harp , and played with his hand : so Saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Shochoh , which belongeth to Judah , and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah , in Ephes @-@ dammim .
and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
and he had greaves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
and the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
if he be able to fight with me , and to kill me , then will we be your servants : but if I prevail against him , and kill him , then shall ye be our servants , and serve us .
and the Philistine said , I defy the armies of Israel this day ; give me a man , that we may fight together .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul .
and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
and Jesse said unto David his son , Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaves , and run to the camp to thy brethren ;
and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge .
and David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the trench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battle .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the armies of the Philistines , and spake according to the same words : and David heard them .
and David spake to the men that stood by him , saying , What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine , and taketh away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
and he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
and Saul said to David , Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
and David said unto Saul , Thy servant kept his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
and I went out after him , and smote him , and delivered it out of his mouth : and when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard , and smote him , and slew him .
David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the LORD be with thee .
and Saul armed David with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
and the Philistine came on and drew near unto David ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
and when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
and all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle is the LORD 's , and he will give you into our hands .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine , he said unto Abner , the captain of the host , Abner , whose son is this youth ? and Abner said , As thy soul liveth , O king , I CANNOT tell .
and Saul said to him , Whose son art thou , thou young man ? and David answered , I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite .
and the women answered one another as they played , and said , Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands .
and Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and David said unto Saul , Who am I ? and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son in law to the king ?
but it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul 's daughter should have been given to David , that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife .
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commune with David secretly , and say , Behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and Saul 's servants spake those words in the ears of David . and David said , seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ?
and Saul said , Thus shall ye say to David , The king desireth not any dowry , but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king 's enemies . but Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
and Saul spake to Jonathan his son , and to all his servants , that they should kill David .
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
and Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father , and said unto him , Let not the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he hath not sinned against thee , and because his works have been to theeward very good :
and Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan : and Saul sware , As the LORD liveth , he shall not be slain .
and there was war again : and David went out , and fought with the Philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter ; and they fled from him .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul also sent messengers unto David 's house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning : and Michal David 's wife told him , saying , If thou save not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slain .
and Saul said unto Michal , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? and Michal answered Saul , He said unto me , Let me go ; why should I kill thee ?
and Saul sent messengers to take David : and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying , and Samuel standing as appointed over them , the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul , and they also prophesied .
then went he also to Ramah , and came to a great well that is in Sechu : and he asked and said , Where are Samuel and David ? and one said , Behold , they be at Naioth in Ramah .
and he stripped off his clothes also , and prophesied before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . Wherefore they say , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
and David fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said before Jonathan , What have I done ? what is mine iniquity ? and what is my sin before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
and David said unto Jonathan , Behold , to morrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
if thy father at all miss me , then say , David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city : for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
and thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD , that I die not :
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
but if I say thus unto the young man , Behold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go thy way : for the LORD hath sent thee away .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day : for he thought , Something hath befallen him , he is not clean ; surely he is not clean .
then Saul 's anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said unto him , Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother 's nakedness ?
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
and Jonathan cried after the lad , Make speed , haste , stay not . and Jonathan 's lad gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
and as soon as the lad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until David exceeded .
then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest : and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David , and said unto him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and the priest answered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hallowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
so the priest gave him hallowed bread : for there was no bread there but the shewbread , that was taken from before the LORD , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
and the servants of Achish said unto him , Is not this David the king of the land ? did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
and David laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
and he changed his behaviour before them , and feigned himself mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down upon his beard .
have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
David therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave Adullam : and when his brethren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down thither to him .
and the prophet Gad said unto David , Abide not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of Judah . then David departed , and came into the forest of Hareth .
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , Hear now , ye Benjamites ; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds ;
then answered Doeg the Edomite , which was set over the servants of Saul , and said , I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests that were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?
and the king said to Doeg , Turn thou , and fall upon the priests . and Doeg the Edomite turned , and he fell upon the priests , and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod .
and David said unto Abiathar , I knew it that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul : I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father 's house .
and David 's men said unto him , Behold , we be afraid here in Judah : how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ?
then David inquired of the LORD yet again . and the LORD answered him and said , Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
so David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their cattle , and smote them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
and it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah . and Saul said , God hath delivered him into mine hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that hath gates and bars .
then said David , O LORD God of Israel , thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? O LORD God of Israel , I beseech thee , tell thy servant . and the LORD said , He will come down .
then said David , Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? and the LORD said , They will deliver thee up .
then David and his men , which were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went whithersoever they could go . and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he forbare to go forth .
and David abode in the wilderness in strong holds , and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph . and Saul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
and he said unto him , Fear not : for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over Israel , and I shall be next unto thee ; and that also Saul my father knoweth .
then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
go , I pray you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who hath seen him there : for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly .
and they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
Saul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : Wherefore he came down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of Maon . and when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .
but there came a messenger unto Saul , saying , haste thee , and come ; for the Philistines have invaded the land .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , Behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ Gedi .
and David said to Saul , Wherefore hearest thou men 's words , saying , Behold , David seeketh thy hurt ?
and it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul , that Saul said , Is this thy voice , my son David ? and Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
swear now therefore unto me by the LORD , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and Samuel died ; and all the Israelites were gathered together , and lamented him , and buried him in his house at Ramah . and David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
and there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said unto the young men , Get you up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name :
and Nabal answered David 's servants , and said , Who is David ? and who is the son of Jesse ? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master .
and David said unto his men , Gird ye on every man his sword . and they girded on every man his sword ; and David also girded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
but the men were very good unto us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conversant with them , when we were in the fields :
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Belial , that a man CANNOT speak to him .
then Abigail made haste , and took two hundred loaves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and an hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on asses .
and it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
now David had said , Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him : and he hath requited me evil for good .
and when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
and David said to Abigail , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which sent thee this day to meet me :
and blessed be thy advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said unto her , Go up in peace to thine house ; see , I have hearkened to thy voice , and have accepted thy person .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel , they spake unto her , saying , David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife .
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
and Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the way . but David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
and David arose , and came to the place where Saul had pitched : and David beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his host : and Saul lay in the trench , and the people pitched round about him .
then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , brother to Joab , saying , Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? and Abishai said , I will go down with thee .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the trench , and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster : but Abner and the people lay round about him .
and David said to Abishai , Destroy him not : for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD 's anointed , and be guiltless ?
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill afar off ; a great space being between them :
and David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , Answerest thou not , Abner ? then Abner answered and said , Who art thou that criest to the king ?
and David said to Abner , Art not thou a valiant man ? and who is like to thee in Israel ? Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king ? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord .
this thing is not good that thou hast done . as the LORD liveth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the LORD 's anointed . and now see where the king 's spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster .
and he said , Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in mine hand ?
and David answered and said , Behold the king 's spear ! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
then Saul said to David , Blessed be thou , my son David : thou shalt both do great things , and also shalt still prevail . so David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
and David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
and Achish said , whither have ye made a road to day ? and David said , Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites .
and Achish believed David , saying , He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him ; therefore he shall be my servant for ever .
and Saul sware to her by the LORD , saying , As the LORD liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice : and the woman spake to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceived me ? for thou art Saul .
and the king said unto her , Be not afraid : for what sawest thou ? and the woman said unto Saul , I saw gods ascending out of the earth .
then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth , and was sore afraid , because of the words of Samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hearkened unto their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat upon the bed .
and the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hasted , and killed it , and took flour , and kneaded it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof :
and she brought it before Saul , and before his servants ; and they did eat . then they rose up , and went away that night .
and Achish answered and said to David , I know that thou art good in my sight , as an angel of God : notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , He shall not go up with us to the battle .
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had invaded the south , and Ziklag , and smitten Ziklag , and burned it with fire ;
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
and David inquired at the LORD , saying , Shall I pursue after this troop ? shall I overtake them ? and he answered him , Pursue : for thou shalt surely overtake them , and without fail recover all .
so David went , he and the six hundred men that were with him , and came to the brook Besor , where those that were left behind stayed .
but David pursued , he and four hundred men : for two hundred abode behind , which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor .
and David said unto him , To whom belongest thou ? and whence art thou ? and he said , I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an Amalekite ; and my master left me , because three days Agone I fell sick .
and David said to him , canst thou bring me down to this company ? and he said , swear unto me by God , that thou wilt neither kill me , nor deliver me into the hands of my master , and I will bring thee down to this company .
and David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon camels , and fled .
then said David , Ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the LORD hath given us , who hath preserved us , and delivered the company that came against us into our hand .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD ;
and to them which were in Hebron , and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
and the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ Shua , Saul 's sons .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @-@ Shan , and came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
and David said unto him , From whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped .
and the young man that told him said , As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa , behold , Saul leaned upon his spear ; and , lo , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
and he said unto me again , Stand , I pray thee , upon me , and slay me : for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David said unto the young man that told him , whence art thou ? and he answered , I am the son of a stranger , an Amalekite .
and David said unto him , How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD 's anointed ?
tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streets of Askelon ; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : thy love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
and it came to pass after this , that David inquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up . and David said , whither shall I go up ? and he said , Unto Hebron .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ Gilead , and said unto them , Blessed be ye of the LORD , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them .
but Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's host , took Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
and Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : Wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and there was a very sore battle that day ; and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah , that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
and Joab said , As God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
so Joab blew a trumpet , and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
and Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
and Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
and they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : but David waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah : and Ish @-@ bosheth said to Abner , Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father 's concubine ?
and Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , Whose is the land ? saying also , Make thy league with me , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all Israel unto thee .
and David sent messengers to Ish @-@ bosheth Saul 's son , saying , Deliver me my wife Michal , which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines .
and Ish @-@ bosheth sent , and took her from her husband , even from Phaltiel the son of Laish .
and , Behold , the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Abner was not with David in Hebron ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Joab and all the host that was with him were come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Joab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ? behold , Abner came unto thee ; why is it that thou hast sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
and afterward when David heard it , he said , I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner :
and David said to Joab , and to all the people that were with him , rend your clothes , and gird you with sackcloth , and mourn before Abner . and king David himself followed the bier .
and I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me : the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness .
and Saul 's son had two men that were captains of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin : ( for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin :
and the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish @-@ bosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
and they came thither into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetched wheat ; and they smote him under the fifth rib : and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
and they brought the head of Ish @-@ bosheth unto David to Hebron , and said to the king , Behold the head of Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul , and of his seed .
and David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said unto them , As the LORD liveth , who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
and David commanded his young men , and they slew them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron . but they took the head of Ish @-@ bosheth , and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron .
then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron , and spake , saying , Behold , we are thy bone and thy flesh .
also in time past , when Saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the LORD said to thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be a captain over Israel .
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD : and they anointed David king over Israel .
so David dwelt in the fort , and called it the city of David . and David built round about from Millo and inward .
and David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
but when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
and David inquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up to the Philistines ? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto David , Go up : for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
and David came to Baal @-@ perazim , and David smote them there , and said , The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me , as the breach of waters . therefore he called the name of that place Baal @-@ perazim .
and David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
and David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals .
and when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God .
and David was displeased , because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah : and he called the name of the place Perez @-@ uzzah to this day .
and David was afraid of the LORD that day , and said , How shall the ark of the LORD come to me ?
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
and it was so , that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
and as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD ; and she despised him in her heart .
and they brought in the ark of the LORD , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
and David said unto Michal , It was before the LORD , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD , over Israel : therefore will I play before the LORD .
and I will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel :
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house .
and when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
and this was yet a small thing in thy sight , O Lord GOD ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant 's house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , O Lord GOD ?
Wherefore thou art great , O LORD God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for thou , O LORD of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , I will build thee an house : therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , O Lord GOD , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
of Syria , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , and of Amalek , and of the spoil of Hadadezer , son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Seraiah was the scribe ;
and there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba . and when they had called him unto David , the king said unto him , Art thou Ziba ? and he said , Thy servant is he .
and the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may shew the kindness of God unto him ? and Ziba said unto the king , Jonathan hath yet a son , which is lame on his feet .
and the king said unto him , Where is he ? and Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he is in the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , in Lo @-@ debar .
then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , from Lo @-@ debar .
now when Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , was come unto David , he fell on his face , and did reverence . and David said , Mephibosheth . and he answered , Behold thy servant !
and David said unto him , Fear not : for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father 's sake , and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually .
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said unto him , I have given unto thy master 's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house .
and Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Micha . and all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
Wherefore Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
and when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth @-@ rehob , and the Syrians of Zoba , twenty thousand footmen , and of king Maacah a thousand men , and of Ish @-@ tob twelve thousand men .
and when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the host of the mighty men .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the LORD do that which seemeth him good .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city . so Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
and Hadarezer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Helam . and the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
and when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
and David sent and inquired after the woman . and one said , Is not this Bath @-@ sheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ?
and David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her uncleanness : and she returned unto her house .
and David said to Uriah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
and when they had told David , saying , Uriah went not down unto his house , David said unto Uriah , Camest thou not from thy journey ? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house ?
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for .
and the messenger said unto David , Surely the men prevailed against us , and came out unto us into the field , and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate .
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
and the LORD sent Nathan unto David . and he came unto him , and said unto him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
and Nathan said to David , Thou art the man . thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ;
and I gave thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take thy wives before thine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
for thou didst it secretly : but I will do this thing before all Israel , and before the sun .
and David said unto Nathan , I have sinned against the LORD . and Nathan said unto David , The LORD also hath put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and anointed himself , and changed his apparel , and came into the house of the LORD , and worshipped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he did eat .
then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
and he said , While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept : for I said , Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me , that the child may live ?
and David comforted Bath @-@ sheba his wife , and went in unto her , and lay with her : and she bare a son , and he called his name Solomon : and the LORD loved him .
and Joab sent messengers to David , and said , I have fought against Rabbah , and have taken the city of waters .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it : lest I take the city , and it be called after my name .
and he took their king 's crown from off his head , the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones : and it was set on David 's head . and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
and it came to pass after this , that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her .
and he said unto him , Why art thou , being the king 's son , lean from day to day ? wilt thou not tell me ? and Amnon said unto him , I love Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister .
and she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Amnon said , Have out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and she answered him , Nay , my brother , do not force me ; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel : do not thou this folly .
and I , whither shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
and she said unto him , There is no cause : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me . but he would not hearken unto her .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and it came to pass after two full years , that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal @-@ Hazor , which is beside Ephraim : and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
and Absalom came to the king , and said , Behold now , thy servant hath sheepshearers ; let the king , I beseech thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
and the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man Gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Amnon only is dead .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , Help , O king .
and the king said unto her , What aileth thee ? and she answered , I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead .
and thy handmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
and the king said unto the woman , Go to thine house , and I will give charge concerning thee .
and the woman of Tekoah said unto the king , My lord , O king , the iniquity be on me , and on my father 's house : and the king and his throne be guiltless .
for we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which CANNOT be gathered up again ; neither doth God respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that his banished be not expelled from him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then thine handmaid said , The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
and the king said unto Joab , Behold now , I have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man Absalom again .
and Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Joab said , To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
and the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . so Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king 's face .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and unto Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a fair countenance .
therefore he said unto his servants , See , Joab 's field is near mine , and he hath barley there ; go and set it on fire . and Absalom 's servants set the field on fire .
so Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
and Absalom said unto him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee .
and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
and it came to pass after forty years , that Absalom said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed unto the LORD , in Hebron .
for thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the LORD .
but Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , Absalom reigneth in Hebron .
and Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counseller , from his city , even from Giloh , while he offered sacrifices . and the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
and there came a messenger to David , saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom .
and the king 's servants said unto the king , Behold , thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
then said the king to Ittai the Gittite , Wherefore goest thou also with us ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile .
whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whither I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and Ittai answered the king , and said , As the LORD liveth , and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
and lo Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God : and they set down the ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and the king said unto Zadok , Carry back the ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD , he will bring me again , and shew me both it , and his habitation :
the king said also unto Zadok the priest , Art not thou a seer ? return into the city in peace , and your two sons with you , Ahimaaz thy son , and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
and David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
and one told David , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
but if thou return to the city , and say unto Absalom , I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father 's servant hitherto , so will I now also be thy servant : then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
and the king said , And where is thy master 's son ? and Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he abideth at Jerusalem : for he said , To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth . and Ziba said , I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
and the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah ? so let him curse , because the LORD hath said unto him , Curse David . who shall then say , Wherefore hast thou done so ?
it may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction , and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hill 's side over against him , and cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
and Absalom , and all the people the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
and it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , was come unto Absalom , that Hushai said unto Absalom , God save the king , God save the king .
and Hushai said unto Absalom , Nay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
and Ahithophel said unto Absalom , Go in unto thy father 's concubines , which he hath left to keep the house ; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father : then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong .
and I will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I counselled .
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people that are with him .
nevertheless a lad saw them , and told Absalom : but they went both of them away quickly , and came to a man 's house in Bahurim , which had a well in his court ; whither they went down .
and when Absalom 's servants came to the woman to the house , they said , Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? and the woman said unto them , They be gone over the brook of water . and when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , after they were departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David , and said unto David , Arise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you .
then David arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over Jordan : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan .
and Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab : which Amasa was a man 's son , whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab 's mother .
and it came to pass , when David was come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo @-@ debar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim ,
and honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of kine , for David , and for the people that were with him , to eat : for they said , The people is hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness .
and the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
and a certain man saw it , and told Joab , and said , Behold , I saw Absalom hanged in an oak .
and Joab said unto the man that told him , And , behold , thou sawest him , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground ? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver , and a girdle .
then said Joab , I may not tarry thus with thee . and he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and they took Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
and Joab said unto him , Thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king 's son is dead .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
and the watchman cried , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth . and he came apace , and drew near .
and the watchman saw another man running : and the watchman called unto the porter , and said , Behold another man running alone . and the king said , He also bringeth tidings .
and the watchman said , Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . and the king said , He is a good man , and cometh with good tidings .
and the king said , Is the young man Absalom safe ? and Ahimaaz answered , When Joab sent the king 's servant , and me thy servant , I saw a great tumult , but I knew not what it was .
and the king said unto Cushi , Is the young man Absalom safe ? and Cushi answered , The enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man is .
but the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , O my son Absalom , O Absalom , my son , my son !
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . and they told unto all the people , saying , Behold , the king doth sit in the gate . and all the people came before the king : for Israel had fled every man to his tent .
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . and Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king , as he was come over Jordan ;
for thy servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said , Shall not Shimei be put to death for this , because he cursed the LORD 's anointed ?
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , Wherefore wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ?
and he answered , My lord , O king , my servant deceived me : for thy servant said , I will saddle me an ass , that I may ride thereon , and go to the king ; because thy servant is lame .
and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God : do therefore what is good in thine eyes .
for all of my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table . what right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
and the king said unto Barzillai , Come thou over with me , and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem .
and Barzillai said unto the king , How long have I to live , that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem ?
thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king : and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward ?
and the king answered , Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
then the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him : and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
and , behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said unto the king , Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away , and have brought the king , and his household , and all David 's men with him , over Jordan ?
so every man of Israel went up from after David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri : but the men of Judah clave unto their king , from Jordan even to Jerusalem .
and one of Joab 's men stood by him , and said , He that favoureth Joab , and he that is for David , let him go after Joab .
and he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel , and to Beth @-@ maachah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then cried a wise woman out of the city , Hear , hear ; say , I pray you , unto Joab , Come near hither , that I may speak with thee .
and when he was come near unto her , the woman said , Art thou Joab ? and he answered , I am he . then she said unto him , Hear the words of thine handmaid . and he answered , I do hear .
I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD ?
Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites , What shall I do for you ? and wherewith shall I make the atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD ?
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose . and the king said , I will give them .
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of the LORD 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bare unto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite :
and it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
and David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh @-@ Gilead , which had stolen them from the street of Beth @-@ Shan , where the Philistines had hanged them , when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa :
and the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah , in the sepulchre of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . and after that God was intreated for the land .
and there was again a battle in GOB with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaare @-@ oregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
these four were born to the giant in Gath , and fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
the God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
and he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the LORD is tried : he is a Buckler to all them that trust in him .
he teacheth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness hath made me great .
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
the LORD liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation .
therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto thy name .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spake to me , He that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the ground , and defended it , and slew the Philistines : and the LORD wrought a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam : and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
and David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate !
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the LORD .
and he said , Be it far from me , O LORD , that I should do this : is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives ? therefore he would not drink it . these things did these three mighty men .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
was he not most honourable of three ? therefore he was their captain : Howbeit he attained not unto the first three .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of Kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of Moab : he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .
Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
and again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel , and he moved David against them to say , Go , number Israel and Judah .
and they passed over Jordan , and pitched in Aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad , and toward Jazer :
and Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
for when David was up in the morning , the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad , David 's seer , saying ,
and David said unto Gad , I am in a great strait : let us fall now into the hand of the LORD ; for his mercies are great : and let me not fall into the hand of man .
so the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba seventy thousand men .
and David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people , and said , Lo , I have sinned , and I have done wickedly : but these sheep , what have they done ? let thine hand , I pray thee , be against me , and against my father 's house .
and Gad came that day to David , and said unto him , Go up , rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite .
and Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
and Araunah said , Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant ? and David said , To buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build an altar unto the LORD , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Araunah said unto David , Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood .
all these things did Araunah , as a king , give unto the king . and Araunah said unto the king , The LORD thy God accept thee .
so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
and Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by En @-@ rogel , and called all his brethren the king 's sons , and all the men of Judah the king 's servants :
and she said unto him , My lord , thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
and thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders .
is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
and the king sware , and said , As the LORD liveth , that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
then Bath @-@ sheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , Let my lord king David live for ever .
the king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon :
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
and Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon . and they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and while he yet spake , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule :
and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon : and they are come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that ye have heard .
and moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . and the king bowed himself upon the bed .
and also thus said the king , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and it was told Solomon , saying , Behold , Adonijah feareth king Solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword .
and Solomon said , If he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die .
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to thine house .
now the days of David drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
but shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those that eat at thy table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother .
now therefore hold him not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
and he said , Speak , I pray thee , unto Solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee nay , ) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife .
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not nay . and the king said unto her , Ask on , my mother : for I will not say thee nay .
now therefore , as the LORD liveth , which hath established me , and set me on the throne of David my father , and who hath made me an house , as he promised , Adonijah shall be put to death this day .
and king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
and it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
and Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD , and said unto him , Thus saith the king , Come forth . and he said , Nay ; but I will die here . and Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me .
and the king said unto him , Do as he hath said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood , which Joab shed , from me , and from the house of my father .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the LORD .
and the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host : and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar .
and the king sent and called for Shimei , and said unto him , Build thee an house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and go not forth thence any whither .
and Shimei said unto the king , The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said , so will thy servant do . and Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath . and they told Shimei , saying , Behold , thy servants be in Gath .
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD , and the commandment that I have charged thee with ?
the king said moreover to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to David my father : therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD , until those days .
and now , O LORD my God , thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
and God said unto him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thyself long life ; neither hast asked riches for thyself , nor hast asked the life of thine enemies ; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , I have done according to thy words : lo , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
and Solomon awoke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
and the other woman said , Nay ; but the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . and this said , No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . thus they spake before the king .
then said the king , The one saith , This is my son that liveth , and thy son is the dead : and the other saith , Nay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and the king said , Bring me a sword . and they brought a sword before the king .
and all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do judgment .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host : and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests :
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers : and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , all the days of Solomon .
and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
and he spake of trees , from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he spake also of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , which had heard of his wisdom .
thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet .
but now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side , so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent .
and , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD spake unto David my father , saying , Thy son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
and Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for : and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
and the LORD gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him : and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a league together .
and Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders did hew them , and the stonesquarers : so they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
and the house which king Solomon built for the LORD , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar .
and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar : he even built them for it within , even for the oracle , even for the most holy place .
and the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
and the two doors were of fir tree : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers : and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid , in the month ZIF :
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
he built also the house of the forest of Lebanon ; the length thereof was an hundred cubits , and the breadth thereof fifty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits , upon four rows of cedar pillars , with cedar beams upon the pillars .
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this porch .
all these were of costly stones , according to the measures of hewed stones , sawed with saws , within and without , even from the foundation unto the coping , and so on the outside toward the great court .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and he made the pillars , and two rows round about upon the one network , to cover the chapiters that were upon the top , with pomegranates : and so did he for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch , four cubits .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it , ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about : the knops were cast in two rows , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and it was an hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies : it contained two thousand baths .
and he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubims : and upon the ledges there was a base above : and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work .
and every base had four brasen wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had undersetters : under the laver were undersetters molten , at the side of every addition .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the basons . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD :
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basons : and all these vessels , which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD , were of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was ,
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone , which Moses put there at Horeb , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
I have surely built thee an house to dwell in , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
and the king turned his face about , and blessed all the congregation of Israel : ( and all the congregation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which spake with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
and I have set there a place for the ark , wherein is the covenant of the LORD , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let thy word , I pray thee , be verified , which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father .
but will God indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens CANNOT contain thee ; how much less this house that I have builded ?
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , O LORD my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant prayeth before thee to day :
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ; )
moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of thy people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
for they be thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant , when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord GOD .
blessed be the LORD , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
that he may incline our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
and Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the LORD , two and twenty thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD .
and at that time Solomon held a feast , and all Israel with him , a great congregation , from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt , before the LORD our God , seven days and seven days , even fourteen days .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant , and for Israel his people .
then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods , and worship them :
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
and this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the LORD , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
for Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the people that were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Millo .
and three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD , and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD . so he finished the house .
and king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion @-@ Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of Edom .
and Hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and they came to Ophir , and fetched from thence gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king Solomon .
and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
and when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he had built ,
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel , and his cupbearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom .
blessed be the LORD thy God , which delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel : because the LORD loved Israel for ever , therefore made he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
and the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees , and precious stones .
and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD , and for the king 's house , harps also and psalteries for singers : there came no such almug trees , nor were seen unto this day .
beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country .
and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three pound of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots , and with the king at Jerusalem .
but king Solomon loved many strange women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Zidonians , and Hittites ;
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as was the heart of David his father .
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he kept not that which the LORD commanded .
Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon , forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father 's sake : but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran : and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
and hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
and the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house : and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's household among the sons of Pharaoh .
and when hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
then Pharaoh said unto him , But what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ? and he answered , Nothing : Howbeit let me go in any wise .
and he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , beside the mischief that hadad did : and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
and Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephrathite of Zereda , Solomon 's servant , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father .
and the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious , he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
and it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and he said to Jeroboam , Take thee ten pieces : for thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , Behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam . and Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , unto Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and king Rehoboam consulted with the old men , that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , How do ye advise that I may answer this people ?
and they spake unto him , saying , If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be thy servants for ever .
but he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter ?
and now whereas my father did Lade you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
and spake to them after the counsel of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heavy , and I will add to your yoke : my father also chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the LORD , that he might perform his saying , which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah , with the tribe of Benjamin , an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
and he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of Levi .
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt incense .
and he gave a sign the same day , saying , This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken ; Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
and the man of God said unto the king , If thou wilt give me half thine house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place :
for so was it charged me by the word of the LORD , saying , Eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
and went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak : and he said unto him , Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah ? and he said , I am .
for it was said to me by the word of the LORD , Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest .
and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah , saying , Thus saith the LORD , forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD , and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee ,
but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the LORD did say to thee , Eat no bread , and drink no water ; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and he spake to his sons , saying , Saddle me the ass . and they saddled him .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
and he laid his carcase in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , Alas , my brother !
and Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . but Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
go , tell Jeroboam , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel ,
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
him that Dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that Dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the LORD hath spoken it .
and all Israel shall mourn for him , and bury him : for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam .
moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day : but what ? even now .
and he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
and they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet .
for they also built them high places , and images , and groves , on every high hill , and under every green tree .
and there were also sodomites in the land : and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel .
and king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and his mother 's name was Naamah an Ammonitess . and Abijam his son reigned in his stead .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem :
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
and forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
and he took away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
and also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook Kidron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had builded ; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
and Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
him that Dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that Dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat .
and his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him , as he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah .
and Zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his stead .
thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet ,
for all the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , by which they sinned , and by which they made Israel to sin , in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah . and the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
and the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : Wherefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
and he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill , Samaria .
but Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD , and did worse than all that were before him .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
and in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years .
in his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho : he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn , and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun .
and Elijah the Tishbite , who was of the inhabitants of Gilead , said unto Ahab , As the LORD God of Israel liveth , before whom I stand , there shall not be dew nor rain these years , but according to my word .
so he went and did according unto the word of the LORD : for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
and as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
for thus saith the LORD God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by Elijah .
and he said unto her , Give me thy son . and he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft , where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
and the LORD heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
and Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , thy son liveth .
and the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth .
and Ahab called Obadiah , which was the governor of his house . ( now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly :
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
and Ahab said unto Obadiah , Go into the land , unto all fountains of water , and unto all brooks : peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive , that we lose not all the beasts .
was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD , how I hid an hundred men of the LORD 's prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
and Elijah said , As the LORD of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , I will surely shew myself unto him to day .
and it came to pass , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said unto him , Art thou he that troubleth Israel ?
and he answered , I have not troubled Israel ; but thou , and thy father 's house , in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD , and thou hast followed Baalim .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel , and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the groves four hundred , which eat at Jezebel 's table .
and call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the LORD : and the God that answereth by fire , let him be God . and all the people answered and said , It is well spoken .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
and Elijah said unto them , Take the prophets of Baal ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon , and slew them there .
and Elijah said unto Ahab , Get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and said to his servant , Go up now , look toward the sea . and he went up , and looked , and said , There is nothing . and he said , Go again seven times .
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . and Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
and the hand of the LORD was on Elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree , behold , then an angel touched him , and said unto him , Arise and eat .
and the angel of the LORD came again the second time , and touched him , and said , Arise and eat ; because the journey is too great for thee .
and he came thither unto a cave , and lodged there ; and , behold , the word of the LORD came to him , and he said unto him , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and he said , I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts : for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and the LORD said unto him , Go , return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus : and when thou comest , anoint Hazael to be king over Syria :
and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel : and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel @-@ meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room .
and he left the oxen , and ran after Elijah , and said , Let me , I pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow thee . and he said unto him , Go back again : for what have I done to thee ?
and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and warred against it .
and the king of Israel answered and said , My lord , O king , according to thy saying , I am thine , and all that I have .
and the messengers came again , and said , Thus speaketh Ben @-@ hadad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Thou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ;
and Ben @-@ hadad sent unto him , and said , The gods do so unto me , and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me .
and Ahab said , By whom ? and he said , Thus saith the LORD , Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces . then he said , Who shall order the battle ? and he answered , Thou .
and they slew every one his man : and the Syrians fled ; and Israel pursued them : and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen .
and the king of Israel went out , and smote the horses and chariots , and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter .
and the prophet came to the king of Israel , and said unto him , Go , strengthen thy self , and mark , and see what thou doest : for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee .
and the children of Israel were numbered , and were all present , and went against them : and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids ; but the Syrians filled the country .
then said he unto him , Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD , behold , as soon as thou art departed from me , a lion shall slay thee . and as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and slew him .
then he found another man , and said , Smite me , I pray thee . and the man smote him , so that in smiting he wounded him .
and he hasted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets .
and he said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for his life , and thy people for his people .
and Naboth said to Ahab , The LORD forbid it me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee .
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with Naboth .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
and Ahab said to Elijah , Hast thou found me , O mine enemy ? and he answered , I have found thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD .
behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and of Jezebel also spake the LORD , saying , The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel .
him that Dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that Dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me ? because he humbleth himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days : but in his son 's days will I bring the evil upon his house .
and the king of Israel said unto his servants , Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ?
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron : and he said , Thus saith the LORD , With these shalt thou push the Syrians , until thou have consumed them .
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth @-@ Gilead , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the king 's hand .
and the king said unto him , How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD ?
and he said , Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD : I saw the LORD sitting on his throne , and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
and the LORD said , Who shall persuade Ahab , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ Gilead ? and one said on this manner , and another said on that manner .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee .
and the king of Israel said , Take Micaiah , and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
and say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace .
and Micaiah said , If thou return at all in peace , the LORD hath not spoken by me . and he said , hearken , O people , every one of you .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , Surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the ivory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and the remnant of the sodomites , which remained in the days of his father Asa , he took out of the land .
for he served Baal , and worshipped him , and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
and Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria , and was sick : and he sent messengers , and said unto them , Go , inquire of Baal @-@ zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease .
and he said unto them , What manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
and they answered him , He was an hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins . and he said , It is Elijah the Tishbite .
and Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and there came down fire from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty . and he answered and said unto him , O man of God , thus hath the king said , Come down quickly .
and Elijah answered and said unto them , If I be a man of God , let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and the fire of God came down from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties : therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah , Go down with him : be not afraid of him . and he arose , and went down with him unto the king .
and it came to pass , when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
and Elijah said unto Elisha , Tarry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel . and Elisha said unto him , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . so they went down to Bethel .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he said , Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Elisha , tarry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho . and he said , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . so they came to Jericho .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he answered , Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Tarry , I pray thee , here ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan . and he said , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . and they two went on .
and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood to view afar off : and they two stood by Jordan .
and Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither , so that they two went over on dry ground .
and it came to pass , when they were gone over , that Elijah said unto Elisha , Ask what I shall do for thee , before I be taken away from thee . and Elisha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
and he said , Thou hast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and he went forth unto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Thus saith the LORD , I have healed these waters ; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land .
and he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made .
and Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster , and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs , and an hundred thousand rams , with the wool .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
and the king of Israel said , Alas ! that the LORD hath called these three kings together , to deliver them into the hand of Moab !
but Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD , that we may inquire of the LORD by him ? and one of the king of Israel 's servants answered and said , Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat , which poured water on the hands of Elijah .
and Jehoshaphat said , The word of the LORD is with him . so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
and Elisha said , As the LORD of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
for thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and ye shall smite every fenced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on armour , and upward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and they said , This is blood : the kings are surely slain , and they have smitten one another : now therefore , Moab , to the spoil .
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward smiting the Moabites , even in their country .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead , and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall . and there was great indignation against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
and Elisha said unto her , What shall I do for thee ? tell me , what hast thou in the house ? and she said , Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house , save a pot of oil .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and it fell on a day , that he came thither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and he said , About this season , according to the time of life , thou shalt embrace a son . and she said , Nay , my lord , thou man of God , do not lie unto thine handmaid .
and he said , Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day ? it is neither new moon , nor sabbath . and she said , It shall be well .
and the mother of the child said , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . and he arose , and followed her .
and Gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . Wherefore he went again to meet him , and told him , saying , The child is not awaked .
and when Elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the LORD .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and Elisha came again to Gilgal : and there was a dearth in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets .
but he said , Then bring meal . and he cast it into the pot ; and he said , Pour out for the people , that they may eat . and there was no harm in the pot .
and his servitor said , What , should I set this before an hundred men ? he said again , Give the people , that they may eat : for thus saith the LORD , They shall eat , and shall leave thereof .
so he set it before them , and they did eat , and left thereof , according to the word of the LORD .
and the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy .
and it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
and Elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
but Naaman was wroth , and went away , and said , Behold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the leper .
are not Abana and Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? may I not wash in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . and when Naaman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the chariot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . and Elisha said unto him , whence comest thou , Gehazi ? and he said , Thy servant went no whither .
the leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever . and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow .
and the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha , Behold now , the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us .
and the man of God said , Where fell it ? and he shewed him the place . and he cut down a stick , and cast it in thither ; and the iron did swim .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and he said , Go and spy where he is , that I may send and fetch him . and it was told him , saying , Behold , he is in Dothan .
and when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . and his servant said unto him , Alas , my master ! how shall we do ?
and he prepared great provision for them : and when they had eaten and drunk , he sent them away , and they went to their master . so the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel .
and he said , If the LORD do not help thee , whence shall I help thee ? out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ?
and the king said unto her , What aileth thee ? and she answered , This woman said unto me , Give thy son , that we may eat him to day , and we will eat my son to morrow .
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Behold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate : and they said one to another , Why sit we here until we die ?
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who spake when the king came down to him .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
and the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done .
and Elisha came to Damascus ; and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hither .
and the king said unto Hazael , Take a present in thine hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of the LORD by him , saying , Shall I recover of this disease ?
and Elisha said unto him , Go , say unto him , Thou mayest certainly recover : Howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die .
and he settled his countenance stedfastly , until he was ashamed : and the man of God wept .
and Hazael said , But what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ? and Elisha answered , The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that he took a thick cloth , and dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Hazael reigned in his stead .
and in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the LORD .
so Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him : and he rose by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots : and the people fled into their tents .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign .
two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
and Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , Gird up thy loins , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to Ramoth @-@ Gilead :
and when thou comest thither , look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
and he arose , and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD , even over Israel .
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the LORD , at the hand of Jezebel .
and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah :
and the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her . and he opened the door , and fled .
then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said unto him , Is all well ? Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee ? and he said unto them , Ye know the man , and his communication .
then they hasted , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trumpets , saying , Jehu is king .
then he sent out a second on horseback , which came to them , and said , Thus saith the king , Is it peace ? and Jehu answered , What hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind me .
and the watchman told , saying , He came even unto them , and cometh not again : and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he driveth furiously .
and Joram said , Make ready . and his chariot was made ready . and Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out , each in his chariot , and they went out against Jehu , and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite .
and it came to pass , when Joram saw Jehu , that he said , Is it peace , Jehu ? and he answered , What peace , so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many ?
and Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
and when Jehu was come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs .
and he said , Throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
and when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , Go , see now this cursed woman , and bury her : for she is a king 's daughter .
and they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
Wherefore they came again , and told him . and he said , This is the word of the LORD , which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel :
and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel ; so that they shall not say , This is Jezebel .
and Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . and Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , unto the rulers of Jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up Ahab 's children , saying ,
look even out the best and meetest of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
and there came a messenger , and told him , saying , They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . and he said , Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Ye be righteous : behold , I conspired against my master , and slew him : but who slew all these ?
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD , which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab : for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah .
and when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the LORD , which he spake to Elijah .
and Jehu gathered all the people together , and said unto them , Ahab served Baal a little ; but Jehu shall serve him much .
and Jehu sent through all Israel : and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , which made Israel to sin .
from Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , even Gilead and Bashan .
and the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the captains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the LORD , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD , and shewed them the king 's son .
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and he brought forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , God save the king .
and Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD 's people ; between the king also and the people .
in the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign ; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zibiah of Beer @-@ sheba .
let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found .
then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD :
for Jozachar the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , smote him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
and Jehoahaz besought the LORD , and the LORD hearkened unto him : for he saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
( and the LORD gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel sin , but walked therein : and there remained the grove also in Samaria . )
neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died . and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof .
and he said to the king of Israel , Put thine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and Elisha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and he said , Take the arrows . and he took them . and he said unto the king of Israel , Smite upon the ground . and he smote thrice , and stayed .
and the man of God was wroth with him , and said , Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times ; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it : whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice .
and Elisha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
and the LORD was gracious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
and Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael the cities , which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war . three times did Joash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us look one another in the face .
thou hast indeed smitten Edom , and thine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tarry at home : for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
but Amaziah would not hear . therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth @-@ Shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth @-@ Shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
for the LORD saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any helper for Israel .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Amaziah had done ;
save that the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places .
and the LORD smote the king , so that he was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house . and Jotham the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
this was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu , saying , Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned a full month in Samaria .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and Menahem exacted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . so the king of Assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
Howbeit the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places . he built the higher gate of the house of the LORD .
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God , like David his father .
and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
and he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the LORD , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the LORD , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the laver from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it , and put it upon a pavement of stones .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Pharoah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the heathen , whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger :
and they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
and the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the LORD : therefore the LORD sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land .
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
unto this day they do after the former manners : they fear not the LORD , neither do they after their statutes , or after their ordinances , or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob , whom he named Israel ;
and the statutes , and the ordinances , and the law , and the commandment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
but the LORD your God ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the groves , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan .
he smote the Philistines , even unto Gaza , and the borders thereof , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
and at the end of three years they took it : even in the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
and the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes :
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah , and took them .
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
and Rab @-@ shakeh said unto them , Speak ye now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
thou sayest , ( but they are but vain words , ) I have counsel and strength for the war . now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and pierce it : so is Pharoah king of Egypt unto all that trust on him .
then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebna , and Joah , unto Rab @-@ shakeh , Speak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the Jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern :
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rab @-@ shakeh .
and he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
and they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say to your master , Thus saith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD , and spread it before the LORD .
Lord , bow down thine ear , and hear : open , LORD , thine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent him to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O LORD our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places .
hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and Esar @-@ Haddon his son reigned in his stead .
I beseech thee , O LORD , remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and Hezekiah said unto Isaiah , What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day ?
and Isaiah said , This sign shalt thou have of the LORD , that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forth ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
and Hezekiah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
at that time Berodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah , and said unto him , What said these men ? and from whence came they unto thee ? and Hezekiah said , They are come from a far country , even from Babylon .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the LORD .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . and he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hephzi @-@ bah .
for he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made a grove , as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
and I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
and Shaphan the scribe shewed the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book . and Shaphan read it before the king .
and the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asahiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
and he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
and as Josiah turned himself , he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount , and sent , and took the bones out of the sepulchres , and burned them upon the altar , and polluted it , according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
and he said , Let him alone ; let no man move his bones . so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria .
and the king commanded all the people , saying , Keep the passover unto the LORD your God , as it is written in the book of this covenant .
surely there was not Holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , wherein this passover was Holden to the LORD in Jerusalem .
notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal .
and the LORD said , I will remove Judah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen , and the house of which I said , My name shall be there .
in his days Pharaoh @-@ nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates : and king Josiah went against him ; and he slew him at Megiddo , when he had seen him .
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
and the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ;
and also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the LORD would not pardon .
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem three months . and his mother 's name was Nehushta , the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valour , even ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and smiths : none remained , save the poorest sort of the people of the land .
and he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
and all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
and the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho : and all his army were scattered from him .
and they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
and the pots , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits , and the chapiter upon it was brass : and the height of the chapiter three cubits ; and the wreathen work , and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about , all of brass : and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away out of their land .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , ruler .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah .
and all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chaldees .
the sons of Japheth ; Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
the sons of Shem ; ELAM , and Asshur , and Arphaxad , and Lud , and Aram , and Uz , and Hul , and gether , and Meshech .
and unto Eber were born two sons : the name of the one was Peleg ; because in his days the earth was divided : and his brother 's name was Joktan .
now the sons of Keturah , Abraham 's concubine : she bare Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah . and the sons of Jokshan ; Sheba , and Dedan .
the sons of Shobal ; Alian , and Manahath , and Ebal , Shephi , and Onam . and the sons of Zibeon ; Aiah , and Anah .
the sons of Anah ; Dishon . and the sons of Dishon ; Amram , and Eshban , and Ithran , and Cheran .
now these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel ; Bela the son of Beor : and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
and when Husham was dead , hadad the son of Bedad , which smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and when Baal @-@ Hanan was dead , hadad reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pai ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
the sons also of Hezron , that were born unto him ; Jerahmeel , and Ram , and Chelubai .
whose sisters were Zeruiah , and Abigail . and the sons of Zeruiah ; Abishai , and Joab , and Asahel , three .
and he took Geshur , and Aram , with the towns of Jair , from them , with Kenath , and the towns thereof , even threescore cities . all these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead .
now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were , Mesha his firstborn , which was the father of Ziph ; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron .
she bare also Shaaph the father of Madmannah , Sheva the father of Machbenah , and the father of Gibea : and the daughter of Caleb was Achsah .
these were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur , the firstborn of Ephratah ; Shobal the father of Kirjath @-@ jearim ,
now these were the sons of David , which were born unto him in Hebron ; the firstborn Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ; the second Daniel , of Abigail the Carmelitess :
and these were born unto him in Jerusalem ; Shimea , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon , four , of Bath @-@ Shua the daughter of Ammiel :
these were all the sons of David , beside the sons of the concubines , and Tamar their sister .
and the sons of Pedaiah were , Zerubbabel , and Shimei : and the sons of Zerubbabel ; Meshullam , and Hananiah , and Shelomith their sister :

and they went to the entrance of Gedor , even unto the east side of the valley , to seek pasture for their flocks .
and they found fat pasture and good , and the land was wide , and quiet , and peaceable ; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old .
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Seir , having for their captains Pelatiah , and Neariah , and Rephaiah , and Uzziel , the sons of Ishi .

and these are they that waited with their children . of the sons of the Kohathites : heman a singer , the son of Joel , the son of Shemuel ,
now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts , of the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites : for theirs was the lot .
and to the sons of Gershom throughout their families out of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .

so all Israel were reckoned by genealogies ; and , behold , they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah , who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression .
and in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin , and of the children of Ephraim , and Manasseh ;

who hitherto waited in the king 's gate eastward : they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi .
and Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office .
for these Levites , the four chief porters , were in their set office , and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God .
and Azel had six sons , whose names are these , Azrikam , Bocheru , and Ishmael , and Sheariah , and Obadiah , and Hanan : these were the sons of Azel .
now the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities , and fled : and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and when they had stripped him , they took his head , and his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to carry tidings unto their idols , and to the people .
and they put his armour in the house of their gods , and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon .
they arose , all the valiant men , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the LORD thy God said unto thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron ; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD ; and they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of the LORD by Samuel .
and the inhabitants of Jebus said to David , Thou shalt not come hither . nevertheless David took the castle of Zion , which is the city of David .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel .
and this is the number of the mighty men whom David had ; Jashobeam , and Hachmonite , the chief of the captains : he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time .
he was with David at Pas @-@ dammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where was a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
and David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , that is at the gate !
and the three brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the LORD ,
and Abishai the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts ; he slew two lionlike men of Moab : also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day .
also the valiant men of the armies were , Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
now these are they that came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
the chief was Ahiezer , then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite ; and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth ; and Berachah , and Jehu the Antothite ,
and Ismaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Josabad the Gederathite ,
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh .
and they helped David against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host .
for at that time day by day there came to David to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of God .
the children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valour , and of his father 's house twenty and two captains .
and of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make David king .
and of the children of Issachar , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us : for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul .
so David gathered all Israel together , from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hamath , to bring the ark of God from Kirjath @-@ jearim .
and David went up , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kirjath @-@ jearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD , that dwelleth between the cherubims , whose name is called on it .
and they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart .
and David and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing , and with harps , and with psalteries , and with timbrels , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
and the ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ Edom in his house three months . and the LORD blessed the house of Obed @-@ Edom , and all that he had .
now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem ; Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
and David inquired of God , saying , Shall I go up against the Philistines ? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up ; for I will deliver them into thine hand .
so they came up to Baal @-@ perazim ; and David smote them there . then David said , God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters : therefore they called the name of that place Baal @-@ perazim .
and the fame of David went out into all lands ; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations .
and David made him houses in the city of David , and prepared a place for the ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
and the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD .
and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
and with them their brethren of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , the porters .
and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps on the Sheminith to excel .
and Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was for song : he instructed about the song , because he was skilful .
and Shebaniah , and Jehoshaphat , and Nethaneel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
and it came to pass , when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams .
and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites that bare the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ephod of linen .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
so they brought the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God .
Asaph the chief , and next to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom : and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps ; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals ;
give thanks unto the LORD , call upon his name , make known his deeds among the people .
give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come before him : worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice : and let men say among the nations , The LORD reigneth .
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD , because he cometh to judge the earth .
and say ye , Save us , O God of our salvation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the heathen , that we may give thanks to thy holy name , and glory in thy praise .
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work required :
to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD , which he commanded Israel ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the LORD , because his mercy endureth for ever ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . and the sons of Jeduthun were porters .
Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel , spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel , whom I commanded to feed my people , saying , Why have ye not built me an house of cedars ?
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
also I will ordain a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , and they shall dwell in their place , and shall be moved no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more , as at the beginning ,
and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . moreover I will subdue all thine enemies . furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house .
O LORD , for thy servant 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
O LORD , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
let it even be established , that thy name may be magnified for ever , saying , The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel , even a God to Israel : and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee .
for thou , O my God , hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house : therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee .
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , O LORD , and it shall be blessed for ever .
and David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : David also houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them an hundred chariots .
likewise from Tibhath , and from Chun , cities of Hadarezer , brought David very much brass , wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
them also king David dedicated unto the LORD , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with saws , and with harrows of iron , and with axes . even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon . and David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
these were born unto the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people , Go , number Israel from Beer @-@ sheba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
and Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword .
and David said unto Gad , I am in a great strait : let me fall now into the hand of the LORD ; for very great are his mercies : but let me not fall into the hand of man .
and David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
and as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
then David said to Ornan , Grant me the place of this threshingfloor , that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD : thou shalt grant it me for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Ornan said unto David , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes : lo , I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; I give it all .
and king David said to Ornan , Nay ; but I will verily buy it for the full price : for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD , nor offer burnt offerings without cost .
and David built there an altar unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the LORD ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
for the tabernacle of the LORD , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , were at that season in the high place at Gibeon .
but David could not go before it to inquire of God : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD .
and David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the joinings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel .
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God :
behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days .
he shall build an house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever .
only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning Israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
is not the LORD your God with you ? and hath he not given you rest on every side ? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand ; and the land is subdued before the LORD , and before his people .
so when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
moreover four thousand were porters ; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made , said David , to praise therewith .
and David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi , namely , Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
the sons of Laadan ; the chief was Jehiel , and Zetham , and Joel , three .
and the sons of Shimei were , Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . these four were the sons of Shimei .
and Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father 's house .
the sons of Amram ; Aaron and Moses : and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons for ever , to burn incense before the LORD , to minister unto him , and to bless in his name for ever .
the sons of Merari ; Mahli , and Mushi . the sons of Mahli ; Eleazar , and Kish .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths , in the new moons , and on the set feasts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the LORD :
and David distributed them , both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , according to their offices in their service .
these were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him .
and the rest of the sons of Levi were these : of the sons of Amram ; Shubael : of the sons of Shubael ; Jehdeiah .
and the sons of Hebron ; Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , Jekameam the fourth .
of Jeduthun : the sons of Jeduthun ; Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun , who prophesied with a harp , to give thanks and to praise the LORD .
all these were the sons of heman the king 's seer in the words of God , to lift up the horn . and God gave to heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
concerning the divisions of the porters : of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore , of the sons of Asaph .
also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour .
the sons of Shemaiah ; Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brethren were strong men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ; )
among these were the divisions of the porters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the LORD .
to Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward , with the gate Shallecheth , by the causeway of the going up , ward against ward .
and of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Jehieli ; Zetham , and Joel his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD .
out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD .
and all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated ; and whosoever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shelomith , and of his brethren .
and of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brethren , men of valour , a thousand and seven hundred , were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD , and in the service of the king .
of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month .
and over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite , and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler : in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , a chief priest : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
of the children of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of Azaziah : of the half tribe of Manasseh , Joel the son of Pedaiah :
of Dan , Azareel the son of Jeroham . these were the princes of the tribes of Israel .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David .
and over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite : and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite :
also Jonathan David 's uncle was a counseller , a wise man , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar : and the general of the king 's army was Joab .
and of all my sons , ( for the LORD hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel .
and he said unto me , Solomon thy son , he shall build my house and my courts : for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
take heed now ; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every candlestick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the candlesticks of silver by weight , both for the candlestick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every candlestick .
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
also pure gold for the fleshhooks , and the bowls , and the cups : and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason ; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver :
all this , said David , the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me , even all the works of this pattern .
furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation , Solomon my son , whom alone God hath chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the LORD God .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to overlay the walls of the houses withal :
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
thine , O LORD , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine own have we given thee .
O LORD God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people , and prepare their heart unto thee :
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testimonies , and thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the LORD , and the king .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD , on the morrow after that day , even a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
and did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness . and they made Solomon the son of David king the second time , and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor , and Zadok to be priest .
and the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness .
but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath @-@ jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the LORD : and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
now , O LORD God , let thy promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reigned over Israel .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon : for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon ; and , behold , my servants shall be with thy servants ,
Huram said moreover , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endued with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work .
then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah , where the LORD appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
and he made the most holy house , the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits : and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work , and overlaid them with gold .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
moreover he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits the length thereof , and twenty cubits the breadth thereof , and ten cubits the height thereof .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
and Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basons . and Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths ; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath , to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars .
the pots also , and the shovels , and the fleshhooks , and all their instruments , did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also , and the tables whereon the shewbread was set ;
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
but I have built an house of habitation for thee , and a place for thy dwelling for ever .
now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel .
but the LORD said to David my father , forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
and said , O LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keepest covenant , and shewest mercy unto thy servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens CANNOT contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , O LORD my God , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee :
that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head ; and by justifying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou from the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers .
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon thy land , which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance .
then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name 's sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive , and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity , saying , We have sinned , we have done amiss , and have dealt wickedly ;
now therefore arise , O LORD God , into thy resting place , thou , and the ark of thy strength : let thy priests , O LORD God , be clothed with salvation , and let thy saints rejoice in goodness .
and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the LORD upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement , and worshipped , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great congregation , from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
and the LORD appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if I shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if I command the locusts to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
if my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom , according as I have covenanted with David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel .
but if ye turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sanctified for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations .
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth @-@ horon the upper , and Beth @-@ horon the nether , fenced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
and Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of thy wisdom :
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon .
and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD , and to the king 's palace , and harps and psalteries for singers : and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah .
and king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which she had brought unto the king . so she turned , and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield . and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two lions standing by the stays :
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us ?
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
so the king hearkened not unto the people : for the cause was of God , that the LORD might perform his word , which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the LORD :
and after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers .
and Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters . )
and Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
and he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin , unto every fenced city : and he gave them victual in abundance . and he desired many wives .
and it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the LORD , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the LORD ,
then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam , and to the princes of Judah , that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said unto them , Thus saith the LORD , Ye have forsaken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak .
and when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah , saying , They have humbled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king 's house .
and when the king entered into the house of the LORD , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet , and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ? and there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
and Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , being mighty men of valour .
ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
and there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden calves , which Jeroboam made you for gods .
and , behold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
and when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the LORD , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and Asa his son reigned in his stead . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
and Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God :
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
and Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
and there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots ; and came unto Mareshah .
then Asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
and they smote all the cities round about Gerar ; for the fear of the LORD came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
and he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon : for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that the LORD his God was with him .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
and Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ maim , and all the store cities of Naphtali .
and at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the LORD thy God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
then Asa was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and Asa oppressed some of the people the same time .
and Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD , but to the physicians .
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which Asa his father had taken .
but sought to the LORD God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah .
also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and tribute silver ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats .
and next to him was Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand .
and of Benjamin ; Eliada a mighty man of valour , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand .
and after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that he had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth @-@ Gilead .
therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , Shall we go to Ramoth @-@ Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? and they said , Go up ; for God will deliver it into the king 's hand .
but Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides , that we might inquire of him ?
and Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron , and said , Thus saith the LORD , With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed .
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth @-@ Gilead , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
and the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him , saying , Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent ; let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good .
and when he was come to the king , the king said unto him , Micaiah , shall we go to Ramoth @-@ Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? and he said , Go ye up , and prosper , and they shall be delivered into your hand .
again he said , Therefore hear the word of the LORD ; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
and the LORD said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ Gilead ? and one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee .
and say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the LORD helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love them that hate the LORD ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD .
and he charged them , saying , Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
then there came some that told Jehoshaphat , saying , There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ; and , behold , they be Hazazon @-@ tamar , which is En @-@ Gedi .
and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the LORD , before the new court ,
and said , O LORD God of our fathers , art not thou God in heaven ? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen ? and in thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
art not thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever ?
and now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir , whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not ;
behold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of thy possession , which thou hast given us to inherit .
and he said , hearken ye , all Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou king Jehoshaphat , Thus saith the LORD unto you , Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD , worshipping the LORD .
and when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the LORD , and that should praise the beauty of holiness , as they went out before the army , and to say , Praise the LORD ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
and when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel .
and Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
and he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat , Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
and their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fenced cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram ; because he was the firstborn .
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah thereto .
but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring , like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab , and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than thyself :
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . Howbeit they buried him in the city of David , but not in the sepulchres of the kings .
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign , and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
but when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , Behold , the king 's son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
but let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , God save the king .
now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the LORD :
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there .
and Jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD , that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Zibiah of Beer @-@ sheba .
and at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD .
and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the LORD ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
and they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD .
thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . and when he died , he said , The LORD look upon it , and require it .
for the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men , and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand , because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers . so they executed judgment against Joash .
and these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , but not with a perfect heart .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
but if thou wilt go , do it , be strong for the battle : God shall make thee fall before the enemy : for God hath power to help , and to cast down .
and Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the Chidren of Seir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
but the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Judah , from Samaria even unto Beth @-@ horon , and smote three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ?
then Amaziah king of Judah took advice , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us see one another in the face .
thou sayest , Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
and Judah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed @-@ Edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent to Lachish after him , and slew him there .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Amaziah did .
and he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the LORD , God made him to prosper .
and he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and brake down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod , and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
and the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king 's captains .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by cunning men , to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks , to shoot arrows and great stones withal . and his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvellously helped , till he was strong .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he transgressed against the LORD his God , and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
and Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourscore priests of the LORD , that were valiant men :
then Uzziah was wroth , and had a censer in his hand to burn incense : and while he was wroth with the priests , the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD , from beside the incense altar .
and Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon him , and , behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence ; yea , himself hasted also to go out , because the LORD had smitten him .
and Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a leper : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jerushah , the daughter of Zadok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Uzziah did : Howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD . and the people did yet corruptly .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD , like David his father :
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all valiant men ; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers .
and Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah that was next to the king .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the captives again , which ye have taken captive of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you .
then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the LORD , and repaired them .
and said unto them , Hear me , ye Levites , sanctify now yourselves , and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD , and turned their backs .
now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us .
my sons , be not now negligent : for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him , to serve him , and that ye should minister unto him , and burn incense .
and of the sons of Elizaphan ; Shimri , and Jeiel : and of the sons of Asaph ; Zechariah , and Mattaniah :
and of the sons of heman ; Jehiel , and Shimei : and of the sons of Jeduthun ; Shemaiah , and Uzziel .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king , and said , We have cleansed all the house of the LORD , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread table , with all the vessels thereof .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the LORD .
then Hezekiah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the LORD .
and they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for Judah . and he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD .
and he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals , with psalteries , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king 's seer , and Nathan the prophet : for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets .
and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
and all the congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded : and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
and Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the LORD , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the LORD your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the LORD .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the LORD .
and Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers .
and all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD .
and concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God , and laid them by heaps .
and Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the porter toward the east , was over the freewill offerings of God , to distribute the oblations of the LORD , and the most holy things .
and next him were Eden , and Miniamin , and Jeshua , and Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small :
beside their genealogy of males , from three years old and upward , even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD , his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses ;
both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges by their courses ;
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him .
so there was gathered much people together , who stopped all the fountains , and the brook that ran through the midst of the land , saying , Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ?
also he strengthened himself , and built up all the wall that was broken , and raised it up to the towers , and another wall without , and repaired Millo in the city of David , and made darts and shields in abundance .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the LORD our God to help us , and to fight our battles . and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , Ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense upon it ?
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and for this cause Hezekiah the king , and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz , prayed and cried to heaven .
and many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem , and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah : so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick to the death , and prayed unto the LORD : and he spake unto him , and he gave him a sign .
but Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath upon him , and upon Judah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
and Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for Baalim , and made groves , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
also he built altars in the house of the LORD , whereof the LORD had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
so Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err , and to do worse than the heathen , whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel .
Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
and when he was in affliction , he besought the LORD his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
and he repaired the altar of the LORD , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and when he had broken down the altars and the groves , and had beaten the graven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the LORD his God .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house :
even to the artificers and builders gave they it , to buy hewn stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed .
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service : and of the Levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
and Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
and Shaphan carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to thy servants , they do it .
and the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah :
behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
and he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem : and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
so kill the passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
and his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Levites : Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle , and three hundred oxen .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the LORD , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the oxen .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo .
and his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
and the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem , and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
and when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
moreover all the chief of the priests , and the people , transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen ; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem .
and the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up betimes , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
and they burnt the house of God , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof .
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
thus saith Cyrus king of Persia , The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , with all them whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .
and this is the number of them : thirty chargers of gold , a thousand chargers of silver , nine and twenty knives ,
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
which came with Zerubbabel : Jeshua , Nehemiah , Seraiah , Reelaiah , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispar , Bigvai , Rehum , Baanah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy and four .
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Ami .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
beside their servants and their maids , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women .
their camels , four hundred thirty and five ; their asses , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren the priests , and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and his brethren , and builded the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings thereon , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
and they set the altar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD , they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets , and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals , to praise the LORD , after the ordinance of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
then wrote Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions ; the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Susanchites , the Dehavites , and the Elamites ,
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Artaxerxes the king ; Thy servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known unto the king , that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem , building the rebellious and the bad city , and have set up the walls thereof , and joined the foundations .
be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be builded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ;
we certify the king that , if this city be builded again , and the walls thereof set up , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem . so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
at the same time came to them Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and their companions , and said thus unto them , Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
and said unto him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be builded in his place .
with three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expences be given out of the king 's house :
now therefore , Tatnai , governor beyond the river , Shethar @-@ boznai , and your companions the Apharsachites , which are beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
then Tatnai , governor on this side the river , Shethar @-@ boznai , and their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
now after these things , in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia , Ezra the son of Seraiah , the son of Azariah , the son of Hilkiah ,
this Ezra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses , which the LORD God of Israel had given : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king , and of his seven counsellers , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks , rams , lambs , with their meat offerings and their drink offerings , and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we certify you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , singers , porters , Nethinims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
and whosoever will not do the law of thy God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
of the sons of Shechaniah , of the sons of Pharosh ; Zechariah : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
and I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava ; and there abode we in tents three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
and I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia , and I told them what they should say unto Iddo , and to his brethren the Nethinims , at the place Casiphia , that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God .
also of the Nethinims , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinims : all of them were expressed by name .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of Ahava , that we might afflict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
and weighed unto them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his counsellers , and his lords , and all Israel there present , had offered :
and I said unto them , Ye are holy unto the LORD ; the vessels are holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers .
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the LORD .
so took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God .
and said , O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens .
now when Ezra had prayed , and when he had confessed , weeping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people wept very sore .
and Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of ELAM , answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
then arose Ezra , and made the chief priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . and they sware .
and they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
and that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away .
and Ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , Ye have transgressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the trespass of Israel .
now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
but the people are many , and it is a time of much rain , and we are not able to stand without , neither is this a work of one day or two : for we are many that have transgressed in this thing .
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
and of the sons of Harim ; Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Parosh ; Ramiah , and Jeziah , and Malchiah , and Miamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
and of the sons of ELAM ; Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , and Abdi , and Jeremoth , and Eliah .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . and it came to pass in the month Chisleu , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and they said unto me , The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach : the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire .
and said , I beseech thee , O LORD God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou commandedst thy servant Moses .
now these are thy servants and thy people , whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power , and by thy strong hand .
Wherefore the king said unto me , Why is thy countenance sad , seeing thou art not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . then I was very sore afraid ,
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
and I said unto the king , If it please the king , and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me unto Judah , unto the city of my fathers ' sepulchres , that I may build it .
and the king said unto me , ( the queen also sitting by him , ) For how long shall thy journey be ? and when wilt thou return ? so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till I come into Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
and the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
then said I unto them , Ye see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
but when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they laughed us to scorn , and despised us , and said , What is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then answered I them , and said unto them , The God of heaven , he will prosper us ; therefore we his servants will arise and build : but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem .
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they builded the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it , unto the tower of Hananeel .
and next unto him builded the men of Jericho . and next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri .
and next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . and next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . and next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , of the goldsmiths . next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries , and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall .
and next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph , even over against his house . and next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah .
and next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , he and his daughters .
the valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate .
but the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Beth @-@ haccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
after him repaired the Levites , Rehum the son of Bani . next unto him repaired Hashabiah , the ruler of the half part of Keilah , in his part .
after him repaired their brethren , Bavai the son of Henadad , the ruler of the half part of Keilah .
and next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall .
after him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece , from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
after him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .
after him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece , from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall , even unto the corner .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel , unto the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that lieth out .
now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , Even that which they build , if a fox go up , he shall even break down their stone wall .
hear , O our God ; for we are despised : and turn their reproach upon their own head , and give them for a prey in the land of captivity :
and cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
and our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the work to cease .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
so neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving that every one put them off for washing .
for there were that said , We , our sons , and our daughters , are many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
also I said , It is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies ?
I likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might exact of them money and corn : I pray you , let us leave off this usury .
then said they , We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do as thou sayest . then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , beside forty shekels of silver ; yea , even their servants bare rule over the people : but so did not I , because of the fear of God .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono . but they thought to do me mischief .
and I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work , so that I CANNOT come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave it , and come down to you ?
wherein was written , It is reported among the heathen , and Gashmu saith it , that thou and the Jews think to rebel : for which cause thou buildest the wall , that thou mayest be their king , according to these words .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Judah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
for they all made us afraid , saying , Their hands shall be weakened from the work , that it be not done . now therefore , O God , strengthen my hands .
and I said , Should such a man as I flee ? and who is there , that , being as I am , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in .
and , lo , I perceived that God had not sent him ; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me : for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
my God , think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works , and on the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
the children of Pahath @-@ Moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen .
the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred forty and three .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
beside their manservants and their maidservants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver .
and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and Ezra blessed the LORD , the great God . and all the people answered , Amen , Amen , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .
and they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month :
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackclothes , and earth upon them .
then stood up upon the stairs , of the Levites , Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani , and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God .
thou art the LORD the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ;
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and laws , by the hand of Moses thy servant :
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Sihon , and the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
so the children went in and possessed the land , and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gavest them into their hands , with their kings , and the people of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
yet many years didst thou forbear them , and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets : yet would they not give ear : therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for thou hast done right , but we have done wickedly :
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept thy law , nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
behold , we are servants this day , and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it :
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
also we made ordinances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ;
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground , and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the LORD :
and the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
and the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts to dwell in other cities .
now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem : but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities , to wit , Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashur , the son of Malchiah ,
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
also of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hashub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
the overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micha . of the sons of Asaph , the singers were over the business of the house of God .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath @-@ arba , and in the villages thereof , and at Dibon , and in the villages thereof , and at Jekabzeel , and in the villages thereof ,
Zanoah , Adullam , and in their villages , at Lachish , and the fields thereof , at Azekah , and in the villages thereof . and they dwelt from Beer @-@ sheba unto the valley of Hinnom .
Sallu , amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah . these were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua .
and in the days of Joiakim were priests , the chief of the fathers : of Seraiah , Meraiah ; of Jeremiah , Hananiah ;
the Levites in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , were recorded chief of the fathers : also the priests , to the reign of Darius the Persian .
also from the house of Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth : for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem .
then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate :
and his brethren , Shemaiah , and Azarael , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and Ezra the scribe before them .
also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced : for God had made them rejoice with great joy : the wives also and the children rejoiced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : Howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing .
and before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah :
but in all this time was not I at Jerusalem : for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
and it grieved me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
and I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ? and I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
and I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath day . remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy .
and one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
thus cleansed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites , every one in his business ;
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the firstfruits . remember me , O my God , for good .
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven Chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king ,
and Memucan answered before the king and the princes , Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ;
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
and the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants , even Esther 's feast ; and he made a release to the provinces , and gave gifts , according to the state of the king .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's Chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
then the king 's servants , which were in the king 's gate , said unto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king 's commandment ?
and the king said unto Haman , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
the posts went out , being hastened by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given in Shushan the palace . and the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city Shushan was perplexed .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Esther 's maids and her Chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's Chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
so Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city , which was before the king 's gate .
and Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king 's treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther , Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the Jews .
then said the king unto her , What wilt thou , queen Esther ? and what is thy request ? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom .
and Esther answered , If it seem good unto the king , let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him .
then the king said , Cause Haman to make haste , that he may do as Esther hath said . so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
and the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
if I have found favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said .
then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Haman said moreover , Yea , Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
and it was found written , that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king 's Chamberlains , the keepers of the door , who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and the king said , What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this ? then said the king 's servants that ministered unto him , There is nothing done for him .
and the king said , Who is in the court ? now Haman was come into the outward court of the king 's house , to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
and the king 's servants said unto him , Behold , Haman standeth in the court . and the king said , Let him come in .
so Haman came in . and the king said unto him , What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour ? now Haman thought in his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ?
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear , and the horse that the king rideth upon , and the crown royal which is set upon his head :
then the king said to Haman , Make haste , and take the apparel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to Mordecai the Jew , that sitteth at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken .
then took Haman the apparel and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai , and brought him on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
and while they were yet talking with him , came the king 's Chamberlains , and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared .
and the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , queen Esther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
for we are sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be slain , and to perish . but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen , I had held my tongue , although the enemy could not countervail the king 's damage .
then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen , Who is he , and where is he , that Durst presume in his heart to do so ?
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
and Harbonah , one of the Chamberlains , said before the king , Behold also , the gallows fifty cubits high , which Haman had made for Mordecai , who had spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of Haman . then the king said , Hang him thereon .
on that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews ' enemy unto Esther the queen . and Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was unto her .
and Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , Behold , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries :
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
and Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a garment of fine linen and purple : and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
and all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them .
thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews , slew they ; but on the spoil laid they not their hand .
and the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons .
for the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
but the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof ; and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , that dwelt in the unwalled towns , made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
to stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur . therefore for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and which had come unto them ,
to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed , according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fastings and their cry .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , whereunto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God , and eschewed evil .
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them .
hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will curse thee to thy face .
and the LORD said unto Satan , Behold , all that he hath is in thy power ; only upon himself put not forth thine hand . so Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The fire of God is fallen from heaven , and hath burned up the sheep , and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The Chaldeans made out three bands , and fell upon the camels , and have carried them away , yea , and slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
and , behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and smote the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
then Job arose , and rent his mantle , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ,
and said , Naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thither : the LORD gave , and the LORD hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the LORD .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
so went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
but he said unto her , Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? in all this did not Job sin with his lips .
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and wept ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven .
let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived .
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ?
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
his children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance .
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness : and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong .
but he saveth the poor from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
behold , happy is the man whom God correcteth : therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty :
even that it would please God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
then should I yet have comfort ; yea , I would harden myself in sorrow : let him not spare ; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook , and as the stream of brooks they pass away ;
what time they wax warm , they vanish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and become loathsome .
therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
I have sinned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserver of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
he is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against him , and hath prospered ?
behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ? who will say unto him , What doest thou ?
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
now my days are swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
they are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey .
if I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself :
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and wilt thou bring me into dust again ?
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh , and hast fenced me with bones and sinews .
if I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
a land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
for vain man would be wise , though man be born like a wild ass 's colt .
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee :
he discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
they grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man .
hold your peace , let me alone , that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
for thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
he cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
he teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me .
his archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
when a few years are come , then I shall go the way whence I shall not return .
lay down now , put me in a surety with thee ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou are my mother , and my sister .
how long will it be ere ye make an end of words ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle , and his candle shall be put out with him .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
surely such are the dwellings of the wicked , and this is the place of him that knoweth not God .
these ten times have ye reproached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
they that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight .
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
his bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
for ye say , Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked ?
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath .
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
is not God in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
yet he filled their houses with good things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
on the left hand , where he doth work , but I CANNOT behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I CANNOT see him :
but he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
why , seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty , do they that know him not see his days ?
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
they are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
how then can man be justified with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
he hath compassed the waters with bounds , until the day and night come to an end .
lo , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is heard of him ? but the thunder of his power who can understand ?
as God liveth , who hath taken away my judgment ; and the Almighty , who hath vexed my soul ;
for what is the hope of the hypocrite , though he hath gained , when God taketh away his soul ?
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
it CANNOT be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
no mention shall be made of coral , or of pearls : for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , yea , and searched it out .
and unto man he said , Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
the young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and stood up .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
and they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
I chose out their way , and sat chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourners .
but now they that are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
my harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that weep .
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour 's door ;
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother 's womb ; )
if I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him :
then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
for I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
behold , I am according to thy wish in God 's stead : I also am formed out of the clay .
behold , in this thou art not just : I will answer thee , that God is greater than man .
he shall pray unto God , and he will be favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will render unto man his righteousness .
he looketh upon men , and if any say , I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ;
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
when he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
should it be according to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest .
but now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity :
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee .
for he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
and it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
hearken unto this , O Job : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God .
touching the Almighty , we CANNOT find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
have the gates of death been opened unto thee ? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
the waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the heart ?
who provideth for the raven his food ? when his young ones cry unto God , they wander for lack of meat .
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve ?
their young ones are in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto them .
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
he saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
hast thou an arm like God ? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him ?
behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
he taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares .
lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
the arrow CANNOT make him flee : slingstones are turned with him into stubble .
so the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
after this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after leasing ? Selah .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , O LORD ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high .
the LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . Higgaion . Selah .
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doth he murder the innocent : his eyes are privily set against the poor .
in the LORD put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Flee as a bird to your mountain ?
for the oppression of the poor , for the sighing of the needy , now will I arise , saith the LORD ; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him .
how long wilt thou forget me , O LORD ? for ever ? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me ?
Lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke , O LORD , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils .
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
the law of the LORD is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the LORD is sure , making wise the simple .
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great transgression .
save , LORD : let the king hear us when we call .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . O LORD my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
for I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
Oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
many sorrows shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the LORD , mercy shall compass him about .
be glad in the LORD , and rejoice , ye righteous : and shout for joy , all ye that are upright in heart .
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
all my bones shall say , LORD , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
but in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let them say continually , Let the LORD be magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off .
he is ever merciful , and lendeth ; and his seed is blessed .
the LORD will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
for innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Mizar .
yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand , and plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them : but thy right hand , and thine arm , and the light of thy countenance , because thou hadst a favour unto them .
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness ; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things .
the princes of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Abraham : for the shields of the earth belong unto God : he is greatly exalted .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount Zion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me : and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Selah .
every one of them is gone back : they are altogether become filthy ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee : thou hast put them to shame , because God hath despised them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion ! when God bringeth back the captivity of his people , Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
for it was not an enemy that reproached me ; then I could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me ; then I would have hid myself from him :
but it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
as a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
but I will sing of thy power ; yea , I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
they search out iniquities ; they accomplish a diligent search : both the inward thought of every one of them , and the heart , is deep .
blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
thou visitest the earth , and waterest it : thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God , which is full of water : thou preparest them corn , when thou hast so provided for it .
the pastures are clothed with flocks ; the valleys also are covered over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
if I regard iniquity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me :
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nations upon earth . Selah .
the chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .

it is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron 's beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
as the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the LORD commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
praise ye the LORD . praise ye the name of the LORD ; praise him , O ye servants of the LORD .

the LORD will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
O LORD , thou hast searched me , and known me .
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .

as for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .

he goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;

the words of Agur the son of Jakeh , even the prophecy : the man spake unto Ithiel , even unto Ithiel and Ucal ,

for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one Dieth , so Dieth the other ; yea , they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast : for all is vanity .
so I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
yea , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
again , I considered all travail , and every right work , that for this a man is envied of his neighbour . this is also vanity and vexation of spirit .

for what hath the wise more than the fool ? what hath the poor , that knoweth to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this is also vanity and vexation of spirit .

I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness :
I counsel thee to keep the king 's commandment , and that in regard of the oath of God .
whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing : and a wise man 's heart discerneth both time and judgment .
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him :
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before God .
then I commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry : for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God giveth him under the sun .
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
for man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and besieged it , and built great bulwarks against it :
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand ; but a fool 's heart at his left .
yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
a fool also is full of words : a man CANNOT tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be darkened ,
or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
and moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many proverbs .
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : fear God , and keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .

thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .

thy lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door , and my bowels were moved for him .
I rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with myrrh , and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh , upon the handles of the lock .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my soul failed when he spake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
what is thy beloved more than another beloved , O thou fairest among women ? what is thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ?
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranates budded .
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that goeth down sweetly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , until he please .
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised thee up under the apple tree : there thy mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal @-@ Hamon ; he let out the vineyard unto keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
my vineyard , which is mine , is before me : thou , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
thou that dwellest in the gardens , the companions hearken to thy voice : cause me to hear it .
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
hear , O heavens , and give ear , O earth : for the LORD hath spoken , I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me .
why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
your country is desolate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers devour it in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
and the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as Sodom , and we should have been like unto Gomorrah .
bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , I CANNOT away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
and when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : yea , when ye make many prayers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
come now , and let us reason together , saith the LORD : though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool .
thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
therefore saith the Lord , the LORD of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies :
and the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
and upon all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ,
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
and the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the honourable .
in that day shall he swear , saying , I will not be an healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing : make me not a ruler of the people .
as for my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them . O my people , they which lead thee cause thee to err , and destroy the way of thy paths .
the LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people , and the princes thereof : for ye have eaten up the vineyard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
moreover the LORD saith , Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they go , and making a tinkling with their feet :
in that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel .
and the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard . my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :
and I will lay it waste : it shall not be pruned , nor digged ; but there shall come up briers and thorns : I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it .
for the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for judgment , but behold oppression ; for righteousness , but behold a cry .
woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth !
in mine ears said the LORD of hosts , Of a truth many houses shall be desolate , even great and fair , without inhabitant .
yea , ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and the seed of an Homer shall yield an ephah .
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the LORD , neither consider the operation of his hands .
therefore my people are gone into captivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honourable men are famished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
but the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness .
that say , Let him make speed , and hasten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine , and men of strength to mingle strong drink :
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .
and one cried unto another , and said , Holy , holy , holy , is the LORD of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
then said I , Woe is me ! for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the LORD of hosts .
then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
and it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is confederate with Ephraim . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
then said the LORD unto Isaiah , Go forth now to meet Ahaz , thou , and Shear @-@ jashub thy son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field ;
and say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
and he said , Hear ye now , O house of David ; Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my God also ?
the LORD shall bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
moreover the LORD said unto me , Take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man 's pen concerning Maher @-@ shalal @-@ hash @-@ baz .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria .
and he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel .
take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
for the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
and I will wait upon the LORD , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , as in the day of Midian .
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise , and garments rolled in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Wonderful , Counseller , The mighty God , The everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
and all the people shall know , even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria , that say in the pride and stoutness of heart ,
therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him , and join his enemies together ;
the ancient and honourable , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
for the leaders of this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
Manasseh , Ephraim ; and Ephraim , Manasseh : and they together shall be against Judah . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
Wherefore it shall come to pass , that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria , and the glory of his high looks .
therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ;
and shall consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body : and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts , O my people that dwellest in Zion , be not afraid of the Assyrian : he shall smite thee with a rod , and shall lift up his staff against thee , after the manner of Egypt .
and the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb : and as his rod was upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt .
he is come to Aiath , he is passed to Migron ; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages :
lift up thy voice , O daughter of Gallim : cause it to be heard unto Laish , O poor Anathoth .
behold , the Lord , the LORD of hosts , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down , and the haughty shall be humbled .
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD , as the waters cover the sea .
and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the Gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
the envy also of Ephraim shall depart , and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off : Ephraim shall not envy Judah , and Judah shall not vex Ephraim .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab ; and the children of Ammon shall obey them .
and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from Assyria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
and in that day thou shalt say , O LORD , I will praise thee : though thou wast angry with me , thine anger is turned away , and thou comfortedst me .
I have commanded my sanctified ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my highness .
they come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the LORD , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
behold , the day of the LORD cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
and Babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldees ' excellency , shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there .
and the people shall take them , and bring them to their place : and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids : and they shall take them captives , whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve ,
that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon , and say , How hath the oppressor ceased ! the golden city ceased !
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming : it stirreth up the dead for thee , even all the chief ones of the earth ; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations .
thy pomp is brought down to the grave , and the noise of thy viols : the worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee .
for thou hast said in thine heart , I will ascend into heaven , I will exalt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north :
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee , and consider thee , saying , Is this the man that made the earth to tremble , that did shake kingdoms ;
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch , and as the raiment of those that are slain , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stones of the pit ; as a carcase trodden under feet .
thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed thy land , and slain thy people : the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned .
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
for I will rise up against them , saith the LORD of hosts , and cut off from Babylon the name , and remnant , and son , and nephew , saith the LORD .
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and upon my mountains tread him under foot : then shall his yoke depart from off them , and his burden depart from off their shoulders .
for the LORD of hosts hath purposed , and who shall disannul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ?
rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall slay thy remnant .
howl , O gate ; cry , O city ; thou , whole Palestina , art dissolved : for there shall come from the north a smoke , and none shall be alone in his appointed times .
the burden of Moab . because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
he is gone up to Bajith , and to Dibon , the high places , to weep : Moab shall howl over Nebo , and over Medeba : on all their heads shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
and Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab ; the howling thereof unto Eglaim , and the howling thereof unto Beer @-@ elim .
for the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood : for I will bring more upon Dimon , lions upon him that escapeth of Moab , and upon the remnant of the land .
take counsel , execute judgment ; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts ; bewray not him that wandereth .
and in mercy shall the throne be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David , judging , and seeking judgment , and hasting righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab ; he is very proud : even of his haughtiness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
therefore shall Moab howl for Moab , every one shall howl : for the foundations of Kir @-@ hareseth shall ye mourn ; surely they are stricken .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
but now the LORD hath spoken , saying , Within three years , as the years of an hireling , and the glory of Moab shall be contemned , with all that great multitude ; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble .
the burden of Damascus . behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it shall be a ruinous heap .
the fortress also shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , saith the LORD of hosts .
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn , and reapeth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim .
in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough , and an uppermost branch , which they left because of the children of Israel : and there shall be desolation .
because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation , and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength , therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants , and shalt set it with strange slips :
in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish : but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
and behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains ; and when he bloweth a trumpet , hear ye .
the burden of Egypt . behold , the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , saith the Lord , the LORD of hosts .
the fishers also shall mourn , and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish .
surely the princes of Zoan are fools , the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish : how say ye unto Pharaoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
where are they ? where are thy wise men ? and let them tell thee now , and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt .
and the LORD shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the LORD , and perform it .
at the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz , saying , Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins , and put off thy shoe from thy foot . and he did so , walking naked and barefoot .
so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners , and the Ethiopians captives , young and old , naked and barefoot , even with their buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the desert of the sea . as whirlwinds in the south pass through ; so it cometh from the desert , from a terrible land .
therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
and he cried , A lion : my lord , I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime , and I am set in my ward whole nights :
and , behold , here cometh a chariot of men , with a couple of horsemen . and he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
O my threshing , and the corn of my floor : that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared unto you .
the burden of Dumah . he calleth to me out of Seir , Watchman , what of the night ? watchman , what of the night ?
for they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
the burden of the valley of vision . what aileth thee now , that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops ?
all thy rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
therefore said I , Look away from me ; I will weep bitterly , labour not to comfort me , because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people .
ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
and in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth :
and it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts , Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , saith the Lord GOD of hosts .
thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts , Go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto Shebna , which is over the house , and say ,
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock ?
he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord 's house .
and I will clothe him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy girdle , and I will commit thy government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
and I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father 's house .
in that day , saith the LORD of hosts , shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the LORD hath spoken it .
the burden of Tyre . howl , ye ships of Tarshish ; for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in : from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them .
and by great waters the seed of Sihor , the harvest of the river , is her revenue ; and she is a mart of nations .
be thou ashamed , O Zidon : for the sea hath spoken , even the strength of the sea , saying , I travail not , nor bring forth children , neither do I nourish up young men , nor bring up virgins .
as at the report concerning Egypt , so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre .
who hath taken this counsel against Tyre , the crowning city , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth ?
behold the land of the Chaldeans ; this people was not , till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof ; and he brought it to ruin .
take an harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
behold , the LORD maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
the land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled : for the LORD hath spoken this word .
the earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , changed the ordinance , broken the everlasting covenant .
therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
then the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed , when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion , and in Jerusalem , and before his ancients gloriously .
O LORD , thou art my God ; I will exalt thee , I will praise thy name ; for thou hast done wonderful things ; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth .
for thou hast made of a city an heap ; of a defenced city a ruin : a palace of strangers to be no city ; it shall never be built .
for thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the needy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall .
and in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people , and the Vail that is spread over all nations .
and it shall be said in that day , Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the LORD ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
yea , in the way of thy judgments , O LORD , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to thy name , and to the remembrance of thee .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the LORD .
O LORD our God , other lords beside thee have had dominion over us : but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
come , my people , enter thou into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
for , behold , the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity : the earth also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her slain .
in that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea .
or let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me .
hath he smitten him , as he smote those that smote him ? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him ?
in measure , when it shooteth forth , thou wilt debate with it : he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind .
yet the defenced city shall be desolate , and the habitation forsaken , and left like a wilderness : there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume the branches thereof .
behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
to whom he said , This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest ; and this is the refreshing : yet they would not hear .
Wherefore hear the word of the LORD , ye scornful men , that rule this people which is in Jerusalem .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD , Behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believeth shall not make haste .
and your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
bread corn is bruised ; because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
this also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
and thou shalt be brought down , and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be , as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all that fight against her and her munition , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
Wherefore the Lord said , forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth , and with their lips do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men :
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
the meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquity are cut off :
therefore thus saith the LORD , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob , Jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
woe to the rebellious children , saith the LORD , that take counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin :
for the Egyptians shall help in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have I cried concerning this , Their strength is to sit still .
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
for thus saith the Lord GOD , the Holy One of Israel ; In returning and rest shall ye be saved ; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength : and ye would not .
for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and though the Lord give you the bread of adversity , and the water of affliction , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more , but thine eyes shall see thy teachers :
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver , and the ornament of thy molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
then shall he give the rain of thy seed , that thou shalt sow the ground withal ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous : in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven days , in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people , and healeth the stroke of their wound .
behold , the name of the LORD cometh from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire :
and his breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the LORD shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
for Tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the LORD shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
as birds flying , so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem ; defending also he will deliver it ; and passing over he will preserve it .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear , and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign , saith the LORD , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers ; yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city :
because the palaces shall be forsaken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ;
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
O LORD , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou their arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller : as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them .
the LORD is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness .
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times , and strength of salvation : the fear of the LORD is his treasure .
hear , ye that are far off , what I have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
he shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
look upon Zion , the city of our solemnities : thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation , a tabernacle that shall not be taken down ; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed , neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken .
thy tacklings are loosed ; they could not well strengthen their mast , they could not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hearken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations , and his fury upon all their armies : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their slain also shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up out of their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
for my sword shall be bathed in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon Idumea , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
and the unicorns shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls ; and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness .
and thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
there shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and hatch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vultures also be gathered , every one with her mate .
seek ye out of the book of the LORD , and read : no one of these shall fail , none shall want her mate : for my mouth it hath commanded , and his spirit it hath gathered them .
say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
and the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with reeds and rushes .
no lion shall be there , nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon , it shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah , and took them .
and the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army . and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
then came forth unto him Eliakim , Hilkiah 's son , which was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , Asaph 's son , the recorder .
I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
but if thou say to me , We trust in the LORD our God : is it not he , whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and said to Judah and to Jerusalem , Ye shall worship before this altar ?
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh , Speak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
but Rabshakeh said , Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own piss with you ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern ;
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , The LORD will deliver us . hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
and he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
and Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say unto your master , Thus saith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD , and spread it before the LORD .
incline thine ear , O LORD , and hear ; open thine eyes , O LORD , and see : and hear all the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O LORD our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places .
hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
and said , Remember now , O LORD , I beseech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
go , and say to Hezekiah , Thus saith the LORD , the God of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will add unto thy days fifteen years .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD , that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken ;
behold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz , ten degrees backward . so the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness :
I said in the cutting off of my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave : I am deprived of the residue of my years .
I reckoned till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bones : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
like a crane or a swallow , so did I chatter : I did mourn as a dove : mine eyes fail with looking upward : O LORD , I am oppressed ; undertake for me .
what shall I say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it : I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
for the grave CANNOT praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit CANNOT hope for thy truth .
the LORD was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD .
Hezekiah also had said , What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD ?
at that time Merodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah : for he had heard that he had been sick , and was recovered .
then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah , and said unto him , What said these men ? and from whence came they unto thee ? and Hezekiah said , They are come from a far country unto me , even from Babylon .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the LORD .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said Hezekiah to Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . he said moreover , For there shall be peace and truth in my days .
speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned : for she hath received of the LORD 's hand double for all her sins .
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain :
the voice said , Cry . and he said , What shall I cry ? all flesh is grass , and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field :
behold , the Lord GOD will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
with whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
the workman melteth a graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold , and casteth silver chains .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image , that shall not be moved .
have ye not known ? have ye not heard ? hath it not been told you from the beginning ? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
to whom then will ye liken me , or shall I be equal ? saith the Holy One .
hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the LORD , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eagles ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
keep silence before me , O islands ; and let the people renew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment .
who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to his foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? he gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stubble to his bow .
thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , Thou art my servant ; I have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dismayed ; for I am thy God : I will strengthen thee ; yea , I will help thee ; yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
fear not , thou worm Jacob , and ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , saith the LORD , and thy redeemer , the Holy One of Israel .
behold , I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth : thou shalt thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as chaff .
thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the potter treadeth clay .
for I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
a bruised reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
he shall not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isles shall wait for his law .
I the LORD have called thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles ;
I am the LORD : that is my name : and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to graven images .
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
sing unto the LORD a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that is therein ; the isles , and the inhabitants thereof .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the LORD shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
but this is a people robbed and spoiled ; they are all of them snared in holes , and they are hid in prison houses : they are for a prey , and none delivereth ; for a spoil , and none saith , Restore .
who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the robbers ? did not the LORD , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
but now thus saith the LORD that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fear not : for I have redeemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
when thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not overflow thee : when thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burned ; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .
fear not : for I am with thee : I will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
I will say to the north , Give up ; and to the south , Keep not back : bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ;
ye are my witnesses , saith the LORD , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no God formed , neither shall there be after me .
I have declared , and have saved , and I have shewed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , saith the LORD , that I am God .
thus saith the LORD , which maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ;
behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the beast of the field shall honour me , the dragons and the owls : because I give waters in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
I , even I , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins .
thus saith the LORD that made thee , and formed thee from the womb , which will help thee ; Fear not , O Jacob , my servant ; and thou , Jesurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring :
one shall say , I am the LORD 's ; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob ; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD , and surname himself by the name of Israel .
thus saith the LORD the King of Israel , and his redeemer the LORD of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God .
and who , as I , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for me , since I appointed the ancient people ? and the things that are coming , and shall come , let them shew unto them .
fear ye not , neither be afraid : have not I told thee from that time , and have declared it ? ye are even my witnesses . is there a God beside me ? yea , there is no God ; I know not any .
they that make a graven image are all of them vanity ; and their delectable things shall not profit ; and they are their own witnesses ; they see not , nor know ; that they may be ashamed .
behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the workmen , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
he burneth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he eateth flesh ; he roasteth roast , and is satisfied : yea , he warmeth himself , and saith , Aha , I am warm , I have seen the fire :
and the residue thereof he maketh a god , even his graven image : he falleth down unto it , and worshippeth it , and prayeth unto it , and saith , Deliver me ; for thou art my god .
remember these , O Jacob and Israel ; for thou art my servant : I have formed thee ; thou art my servant : O Israel , thou shalt not be forgotten of me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , thy transgressions , and , as a cloud , thy sins : return unto me ; for I have redeemed thee .
sing , O ye heavens ; for the LORD hath done it : shout , ye lower parts of the earth : break forth into singing , ye mountains , O forest , and every tree therein : for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob , and glorified himself in Israel .
that frustrateth the tokens of the liars , and maketh diviners mad ; that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
that saith of Cyrus , He is my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure : even saying to Jerusalem , Thou shalt be built ; and to the temple , Thy foundation shall be laid .
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel .
I am the LORD , and there is none else , there is no God beside me : I girded thee , though thou hast not known me :
drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; I the LORD have created it .
thus saith the LORD , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker , Ask me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
I have made the earth , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captives , not for price nor reward , saith the LORD of hosts .
they shall be ashamed , and also confounded , all of them : they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
for thus saith the LORD that created the heavens ; God himself that formed the earth and made it ; he hath established it , he created it not in vain , he formed it to be inhabited : I am the LORD ; and there is none else .
I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth : I said not unto the seed of Jacob , Seek ye me in vain : I the LORD speak righteousness , I declare things that are right .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
surely , shall one say , in the LORD have I righteousness and strength : even to him shall men come ; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed .
Bel boweth down , Nebo stoopeth , their idols were upon the beasts , and upon the cattle : your carriages were heavy loaden ; they are a burden to the weary beast .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
and even to your old age I am he ; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you : I have made , and I will bear ; even I will carry , and will deliver you .
they lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ,
I bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not tarry : and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory .
come down , and sit in the dust , O virgin daughter of Babylon , sit on the ground : there is no throne , O daughter of the Chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate .
take the millstones , and grind meal : uncover thy locks , make bare the leg , uncover the thigh , pass over the rivers .
and thou saidst , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , that dwellest carelessly , that sayest in thine heart , I am , and none else beside me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children :
stand now with thine enchantments , and with the multitude of thy sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail .
thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels . let now the astrologers , the Stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at , nor fire to sit before it .
for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the God of Israel ; The LORD of hosts is his name .
I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I shewed it thee : lest thou shouldest say , Mine idol hath done them , and my graven image , and my molten image , hath commanded them .
yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened : for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and I will not give my glory unto another .
hearken unto me , O Jacob and Israel , my called ; I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
all ye , assemble yourselves , and hear ; which among them hath declared these things ? the LORD hath loved him : he will do his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yea , I have called him : I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
go ye forth of Babylon , flee ye from the Chaldeans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob .
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he clave the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his quiver hath he hid me ;
then I said , I have laboured in vain , I have spent my strength for nought , and in vain : yet surely my judgment is with the LORD , and my work with my God .
and now , saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant , to bring Jacob again to him , Though Israel be not gathered , yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD , and my God shall be my strength .
thus saith the LORD , In an acceptable time have I heard thee , and in a day of salvation have I helped thee : and I will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the desolate heritages ;
that thou mayest say to the prisoners , Go forth ; to them that are in darkness , shew yourselves . they shall feed in the ways , and their pastures shall be in all high places .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
sing , O heavens ; and be joyful , O earth ; and break forth into singing , O mountains : for the LORD hath comforted his people , and will have mercy upon his afflicted .
can a woman forget her sucking child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? yea , they may forget , yet will I not forget thee .
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , The place is too strait for me : give place to me that I may dwell .
but thus saith the LORD , Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee , and I will save thy children .
and I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
thus saith the LORD , Where is the bill of your mother 's divorcement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves , and for your transgressions is your mother put away .
the Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
for the Lord GOD will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
he is near that justifieth me ; who will contend with me ? let us stand together : who is mine adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord GOD will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you that feareth the LORD , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the LORD , and stay upon his God .
hearken to me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the LORD : look unto the rock whence ye are hewn , and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged .
for the LORD shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the LORD ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
hearken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the isles shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
hearken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the reproach of men , neither be ye afraid of their revilings .
awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the LORD ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old . art thou not it that hath cut Rahab , and wounded the dragon ?
therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return , and come with singing unto Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
I , even I , am he that comforteth you : who art thou , that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be made as grass ;
and I have put my words in thy mouth , and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand , that I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and say unto Zion , Thou art my people .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? desolation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
thus saith thy Lord the LORD , and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people , Behold , I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling , even the dregs of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
awake , awake ; put on thy strength , O Zion ; put on thy beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean .
shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of thy neck , O captive daughter of Zion .
now therefore , what have I here , saith the LORD , that my people is taken away for nought ? they that rule over them make them to howl , saith the LORD ; and my name continually every day is blasphemed .
thy watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the LORD shall bring again Zion .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the LORD will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward .
but he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed .
all we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all .
he was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the living : for the transgression of my people was he stricken .
and he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations : spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes ;
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
for thy Maker is thine husband ; the LORD of hosts is his name ; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel ; The God of the whole earth shall he be called .
in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee , saith the LORD thy Redeemer .
for this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed , saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee .
O thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , I will lay thy stones with fair colours , and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
and all thy children shall be taught of the LORD ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
in righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
behold , I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire , and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters , and he that hath no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not ? hearken diligently unto me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the LORD , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
for as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
thus saith the LORD , Keep ye judgment , and do justice : for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the LORD , speak , saying , The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the eunuch say , Behold , I am a dry tree .
even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the sons of the stranger , that join themselves to the LORD , to serve him , and to love the name of the LORD , to be his servants , every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it , and taketh hold of my covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people .
the Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith , Yet will I gather others to him , beside those that are gathered unto him .
his watchmen are blind : they are all ignorant , they are all dumb dogs , they CANNOT bark ; sleeping , lying down , loving to slumber .
yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that CANNOT understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
come ye , say they , I will fetch wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and to morrow shall be as this day , and much more abundant .
the righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart : and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come .
against whom do ye sport yourselves ? against whom make ye a wide mouth , and draw out the tongue ? are ye not children of transgression , a seed of falsehood ,
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed : even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
and thou wentest to the king with ointment , and didst increase thy perfumes , and didst send thy messengers far off , and didst debase thyself even unto hell .
for thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , whose name is Holy ; I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones .
for I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always wroth : for the spirit should fail before me , and the souls which I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth , and smote him : I hid me , and was wroth , and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart .
I have seen his ways , and will heal him : I will lead him also , and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners .
then shall thy light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and thy righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward .
then shalt thou call , and the LORD shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , Here I am . if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking vanity ;
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul ; then shall thy light rise in obscurity , and thy darkness be as the noonday :
they hatch cockatrice ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he that eateth of their eggs Dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the night ; we are in desolate places as dead men .
for our transgressions are multiplied before thee , and our sins testify against us : for our transgressions are with us ; and as for our iniquities , we know them ;
for , behold , the darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the people : but the LORD shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen upon thee .
lift up thine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side .
surely the isles shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the LORD thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because he hath glorified thee .
and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls , and their kings shall minister unto thee : for in my wrath I smote thee , but in my favour have I had mercy on thee .
therefore thy gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more thy light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and thy God thy glory .
thy sun shall no more go down ; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself : for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
thy people also shall be all righteous : they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
and they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
for your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .
for I the LORD love judgment , I hate robbery for burnt offering ; and I will direct their work in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles , and their offspring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the LORD shall name .
for as a young man marrieth a virgin , so shall thy sons marry thee : and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so shall thy God rejoice over thee .
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the LORD ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
and I will tread down the people in mine anger , and make them drunk in my fury , and I will bring down their strength to the earth .
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old .
then he remembered the days of old , Moses , and his people , saying , Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock ? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ?
that led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm , dividing the water before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
as a beast goeth down into the valley , the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest : so didst thou lead thy people , to make thyself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me ? are they restrained ?
the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens , that thou wouldest come down , that the mountains might flow down at thy presence ,
as when the melting fire burneth , the fire causeth the waters to boil , to make thy name known to thine adversaries , that the nations may tremble at thy presence !
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , O God , beside thee , what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him .
thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember thee in thy ways : behold , thou art wroth ; for we have sinned : in those is continuance , and we shall be saved .
and there is none that calleth upon thy name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid thy face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our iniquities .
be not wroth very sore , O LORD , neither remember iniquity for ever : behold , see , we beseech thee , we are all thy people .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned up with fire : and all our pleasant things are laid waste .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , Behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
which remain among the graves , and lodge in the monuments , which eat swine 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
your iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , saith the LORD , which have burned incense upon the mountains , and blasphemed me upon the hills : therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom .
thus saith the LORD , As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one saith , Destroy it not ; for a blessing is in it : so will I do for my servants ' sakes , that I may not destroy them all .
and I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
but ye are they that forsake the LORD , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that furnish the drink offering unto that number .
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the Lord GOD shall slay thee , and call his servants by another name :
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
and I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
they shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD , and their offspring with them .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus saith the LORD , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
a voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies .
who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such things ? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ? or shall a nation be born at once ? for as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children .
shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? saith the LORD : shall I cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? saith thy God .
rejoice ye with Jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn for her :
for thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream : then shall ye suck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be dandled upon her knees .
and when ye see this , your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like an herb : and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants , and his indignation toward his enemies .
for , behold , the LORD will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
for by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh : and the slain of the LORD shall be many .
they that sanctify themselves , and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine 's flesh , and the abomination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , saith the LORD .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh .
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
it came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , Jeremiah , what seest thou ? and I said , I see a rod of an almond tree .
and the word of the LORD came unto me the second time , saying , What seest thou ? and I said , I see a seething pot ; and the face thereof is toward the north .
and I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
for , behold , I have made thee this day a defenced city , and an iron pillar , and brasen walls against the whole land , against the kings of Judah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , saith the LORD , to deliver thee .
Israel was holiness unto the LORD , and the firstfruits of his increase : all that devour him shall offend ; evil shall come upon them , saith the LORD .
thus saith the LORD , What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
for my people have committed two evils ; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters , and hewed them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
and now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the river ?
thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backslidings shall reprove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God , and that my fear is not in thee , saith the Lord GOD of hosts .
yet I had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me ?
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
yea , thou shalt go forth from him , and thine hands upon thine head : for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
lift up thine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been lien with . in the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness .
therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; and thou hadst a whore 's forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
the LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king , Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done ? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the harlot .
and I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou backsliding Israel , saith the LORD ; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for I am merciful , saith the LORD , and I will not keep anger for ever .
only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the LORD .
turn , O backsliding children , saith the LORD ; for I am married unto you : and I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion :
but I said , How shall I put thee among the children , and give thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations ? and I said , Thou shalt call me , My father ; and shalt not turn away from me .
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel .
if thou wilt return , O Israel , saith the LORD , return unto me : and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight , then shalt thou not remove .
and thou shalt swear , The LORD liveth , in truth , in judgment , and in righteousness ; and the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory .
for thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem , Break up your fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
circumcise yourselves to the LORD , and take away the foreskins of your heart , ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
declare ye in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , Blow ye the trumpet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assemble yourselves , and let us go into the defenced cities .
set up the standard toward Zion : retire , stay not : for I will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction .
the lion is come up from his thicket , and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate ; and thy cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabitant .
for this gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl : for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us .
at that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem , A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people , not to fan , nor to cleanse ,
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . woe unto us ! for we are spoiled .
as keepers of a field , are they against her round about ; because she hath been rebellious against me , saith the LORD .
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee ; this is thy wickedness , because it is bitter , because it reacheth unto thine heart .
my bowels , my bowels ! I am pained at my very heart ; my heart maketh a noise in me ; I CANNOT hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is spoiled : suddenly are my tents spoiled , and my curtains in a moment .
for thus hath the LORD said , The whole land shall be desolate ; yet will I not make a full end .
for this shall the earth mourn , and the heavens above be black : because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and will not repent , neither will I turn back from it .
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen ; they shall go into thickets , and climb up upon the rocks : every city shall be forsaken , and not a man dwell therein .
Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them , and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them , a leopard shall watch over their cities : every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces : because their transgressions are many , and their backslidings are increased .
how shall I pardon thee for this ? thy children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses .
they were as fed horses in the morning : every one neighed after his neighbour 's wife .
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her battlements ; for they are not the LORD 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith the LORD .
and they shall eat up thine harvest , and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat : they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds : they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees : they shall impoverish thy fenced cities , wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
neither say they in their heart , Let us now fear the LORD our God , that giveth rain , both the former and the latter , in his season : he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest .
for among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxen rich .
the prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end thereof ?
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they CANNOT hearken : behold , the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
and their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , saith the LORD .
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall : at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down , saith the LORD .
thus saith the LORD , Stand ye in the ways , and see , and ask for the old paths , where is the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls . but they said , We will not walk therein .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hearkened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
to what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices sweet unto me .
thus saith the LORD , Behold , a people cometh from the north country , and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth .
they shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Zion .
we have heard the fame thereof : our hands wax feeble : anguish hath taken hold of us , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us .
the bellows are burned , the lead is consumed of the fire ; the founder melteth in vain : for the wicked are not plucked away .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , even I have seen it , saith the LORD .
but go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
and now , because ye have done all these works , saith the LORD , and I spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
do they provoke me to anger ? saith the LORD : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat flesh .
but this thing commanded I them , saying , obey my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you , that it may be well unto you .
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
but thou shalt say unto them , This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God , nor receiveth correction : truth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight , saith the LORD : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to pollute it .
and they have built the high places of Tophet , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that it shall no more be called Tophet , nor the valley of the son of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Tophet , till there be no place .
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whither I have driven them , saith the LORD of hosts .
moreover thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD ; Shall they fall , and not arise ? shall he turn away , and not return ?
yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD .
how do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the LORD is with us ? lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
the wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the LORD ; and what wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , saith the LORD .
I will surely consume them , saith the LORD : there shall be no grapes on the vine , nor figs on the fig tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them .
is there no balm in Gilead ; is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith the LORD .
thine habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , saith the LORD .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he layeth his wait .
and I will make Jerusalem heaps , and a den of dragons ; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate , without an inhabitant .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and I will send a sword after them , till I have consumed them .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , Consider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for cunning women , that they may come :
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we spoiled ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because our dwellings have cast us out .
yet hear the word of the LORD , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbour lamentation .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
speak , Thus saith the LORD , Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field , and as the handful after the harvestman , and none shall gather them .
thus saith the LORD , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches :
but let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth me , that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , saith the LORD .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised ;
Egypt , and Judah , and Edom , and the children of Ammon , and Moab , and all that are in the utmost corners , that dwell in the wilderness : for all these nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart .
they are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they CANNOT go . be not afraid of them ; for they CANNOT do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
but the LORD is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
every man is brutish in his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , and the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name .
for thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
my tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not , and upon the families that call not on thy name : for they have eaten up Jacob , and devoured him , and consumed him , and have made his habitation desolate .
and say thou unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel ; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant ,
which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , from the iron furnace , saying , obey my voice , and do them , according to all which I command you : so shall ye be my people , and I will be your God :
that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day . then answered I , and said , So be it , O LORD .
then the LORD said unto me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , Hear ye the words of this covenant , and do them .
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto me , I will not hearken unto them .
then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto Baal .
what hath my beloved to do in mine house , seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many , and the holy flesh is passed from thee ? when thou doest evil , then thou rejoicest .
the LORD called thy name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for the LORD of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal .
but , O LORD of hosts , that judgest righteously , that triest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine :
and there shall be no remnant of them : for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
righteous art thou , O LORD , when I plead with thee : yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments : Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper ? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously ?
thou hast planted them , yea , they have taken root : they grow , yea , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in their mouth , and far from their reins .
if thou hast run with the footmen , and they have wearied thee , then how canst thou contend with horses ? and if in the land of peace , wherein thou trustedst , they wearied thee , then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan ?
for even thy brethren , and the house of thy father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
I have forsaken mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
many pastors have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have sown wheat , but shall reap thorns : they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD .
thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours , that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit ; Behold , I will pluck them out of their land , and pluck out the house of Judah from among them .
take the girdle that thou hast got , which is upon thy loins , and arise , go to Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
and it came to pass after many days , that the LORD said unto me , Arise , go to Euphrates , and take the girdle from thence , which I commanded thee to hide there .
therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word ; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Every bottle shall be filled with wine : and they shall say unto thee , Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ?
and I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , saith the LORD : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but destroy them .
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee ? for thou hast taught them to be captains , and as chief over thee : shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
I have seen thine adulteries , and thy neighings , the lewdness of thy whoredom , and thine abominations on the hills in the fields . woe unto thee , O Jerusalem ! wilt thou not be made clean ? when shall it once be ?
Judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish ; they are black unto the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
and the wild asses did stand in the high places , they snuffed up the wind like dragons ; their eyes did fail , because there was no grass .
O the hope of Israel , the saviour thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night ?
why shouldest thou be as a man astonied , as a mighty man that CANNOT save ? yet thou , O LORD , art in the midst of us , and we are called by thy name ; leave us not .
thus saith the LORD unto this people , Thus have they loved to wander , they have not refrained their feet , therefore the LORD doth not accept them ; he will now remember their iniquity , and visit their sins .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation , I will not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
then said I , Ah , Lord GOD ! behold , the prophets say unto them , Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but I will give you assured peace in this place .
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
hast thou utterly rejected Judah ? hath thy soul lothed Zion ? why hast thou smitten us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
we acknowledge , O LORD , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers : for we have sinned against thee .
do not abhor us , for thy name 's sake , do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain ? or can the heavens give showers ? art not thou he , O LORD our God ? therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
and I will appoint over them four kinds , saith the LORD : the sword to slay , and the dogs to tear , and the fowls of the heaven , and the beasts of the earth , to devour and destroy .
and I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
thou hast forsaken me , saith the LORD , thou art gone backward : therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee ; I am weary with repenting .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
she that hath borne seven languisheth : she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day : she hath been ashamed and confounded : and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , saith the LORD .
woe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth ! I have neither lent on usury , nor men have lent to me on usury ; yet every one of them doth curse me .
the LORD said , Verily it shall be well with thy remnant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
and I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
and I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , saith the LORD .
for thus saith the LORD , Enter not into the house of mourning , neither go to lament nor bemoan them : for I have taken away my peace from this people , saith the LORD , even lovingkindness and mercies .
both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them :
then shalt thou say unto them , Because your fathers have forsaken me , saith the LORD , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have worshipped them , and have forsaken me , and have not kept my law ;
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that it shall no more be said , The LORD liveth , that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , The LORD liveth , that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither he had driven them : and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers .
behold , I will send for many fishers , saith the LORD , and they shall fish them ; and after will I send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
O LORD , my strength , and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of affliction , the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Surely our fathers have inherited lies , vanity , and things wherein there is no profit .
therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The LORD .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
I the LORD search the heart , I try the reins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings .
as the partridge sitteth on eggs , and hatcheth them not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
O LORD , the hope of Israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the LORD , the fountain of living waters .
heal me , O LORD , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
as for me , I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee : neither have I desired the woeful day ; thou knowest : that which came out of my lips was right before thee .
let them be confounded that persecute me , but let not me be confounded : let them be dismayed , but let not me be dismayed : bring upon them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
and say unto them , Hear ye the word of the LORD , ye kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus saith the LORD ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
and it shall come to pass , if ye diligently hearken unto me , saith the LORD , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day , but hallow the sabbath day , to do no work therein ;
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem : and this city shall remain for ever .
but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day , and not to bear a burden , even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day ; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be quenched .
arise , and go down to the potter 's house , and there I will cause thee to hear my words .
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter : so he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the potter to make it .
O house of Israel , CANNOT I do with you as this potter ? saith the LORD . behold , as the clay is in the potter 's hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if it do evil in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then I will repent of the good , wherewith I said I would benefit them .
and they said , There is no hope : but we will walk after our own devices , and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Ask ye now among the heathen , who hath heard such things : the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
thus saith the LORD , Go and get a potter 's earthen bottle , and take of the ancients of the people , and of the ancients of the priests ;
because they have forsaken me , and have estranged this place , and have burned incense in it unto other gods , whom neither they nor their fathers have known , nor the kings of Judah , and have filled this place with the blood of innocents ;
they have built also the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that this place shall no more be called Tophet , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter .
and I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness , wherewith their enemies , and they that seek their lives , shall straiten them .
thus will I do unto this place , saith the LORD , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as Tophet :
then came Jeremiah from Tophet , whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the LORD 's house ; and said to all the people ,
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it , because they have hardened their necks , that they might not hear my words .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . then said Jeremiah unto him , The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur , but Magor @-@ missabib .
and thou , Pashur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity : and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophesied lies .
but the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O LORD of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
and let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew , and repented not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the shouting at noontide ;
and I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
and unto this people thou shalt say , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth out , and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
for I have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith the LORD : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
and say , Hear the word of the LORD , O king of Judah , that sittest upon the throne of David , thou , and thy servants , and thy people that enter in by these gates :
thus saith the LORD ; Execute ye judgment and righteousness , and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor : and do no wrong , do no violence to the stranger , the fatherless , nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
but if ye will not hear these words , I swear by myself , saith the LORD , that this house shall become a desolation .
and I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city ?
woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness , and his chambers by wrong ; that useth his neighbour 's service without wages , and giveth him not for his work ;
he judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well with him : was not this to know me ? saith the LORD .
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in Bashan , and cry from the passages : for all thy lovers are destroyed .
O inhabitant of Lebanon , that makest thy nest in the cedars , how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee , the pain as of a woman in travail !
and I will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
thus saith the LORD , Write ye this man childless , a man that shall not prosper in his days : for no man of his seed shall prosper , sitting upon the throne of David , and ruling any more in Judah .
and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
and I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the LORD .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch , and a King shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that they shall no more say , The LORD liveth , which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , The LORD liveth , which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I had driven them ; and they shall dwell in their own land .
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets ; all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine hath overcome , because of the LORD , and because of the words of his holiness .
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , saith the LORD .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets ; Behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
they say still unto them that despise me , The LORD hath said , Ye shall have peace ; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart , No evil shall come upon you .
for who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
the anger of the LORD shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
but if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
and when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , saying , What is the burden of the LORD ? thou shalt then say unto them , What burden ? I will even forsake you , saith the LORD .
and as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , The burden of the LORD , I will even punish that man and his house .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , What hath the LORD answered ? and , What hath the LORD spoken ?
and the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of the LORD of hosts our God .
therefore , behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will forsake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence :
one basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
and I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the LORD : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
and I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places whither I shall drive them .
and I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers .
the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying ,
from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the LORD hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
and go not after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
and this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the works of their own hands .
for thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me ; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send thee , to drink it .
then took I the cup at the LORD 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the LORD had sent me :
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ,
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Drink ye , and be drunken , and spue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Ye shall certainly drink .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
howl , ye shepherds , and cry ; and wallow yourselves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
he hath forsaken his covert , as the lion : for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD , saying ,
thus saith the LORD ; Stand in the court of the LORD 's house , and speak unto all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in the LORD 's house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD ; If ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
now it came to pass , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Thou shalt surely die .
why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD , saying , This house shall be like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant ? and all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD .
then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears .
then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
but know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah , and spake to all the people of Judah , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Zion shall be plowed like a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountains of the house as the high places of a forest .
and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath @-@ jearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king ; who slew him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD , saying ,
and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the Ammonites , and to the king of Tyrus , and to the king of Zidon , by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah ;
and command them to say unto their masters , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say unto your masters ;
I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
therefore hearken not ye to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreamers , nor to your enchanters , nor to your sorcerers , which speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they prophesy a lie unto you , to remove you far from your land ; and that I should drive you out , and ye should perish .
but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him , those will I let remain still in their own land , saith the LORD ; and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
why will ye die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
for I have not sent them , saith the LORD , yet they prophesy a lie in my name ; that I might drive you out , and that ye might perish , ye , and the prophets that prophesy unto you .
for thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city ,
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be until the day that I visit them , saith the LORD ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , that went into Babylon , saith the LORD : for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the LORD hath truly sent him .
then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and brake it .
go and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus saith the LORD ; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood ; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron .
then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah ; The LORD hath not sent thee ; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD .
now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives , and to the priests , and to the prophets , and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon ;
( after that Jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , and the carpenters , and the smiths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) saying ,
take ye wives , and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
and seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the LORD for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : I have not sent them , saith the LORD .
then shall ye call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and I will hearken unto you .
and I will be found of you , saith the LORD : and I will turn away your captivity , and I will gather you from all the nations , and from all the places whither I have driven you , saith the LORD ; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive .
know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David , and of all the people that dwelleth in this city , and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity ;
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Behold , I will send upon them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that CANNOT be eaten , they are so evil .
hear ye therefore the word of the LORD , all ye of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon :
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon , saying , The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ;
because they have committed villany in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbours ' wives , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not commanded them ; even I know , and am a witness , saith the LORD .
thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
the LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
for therefore he sent unto us in Babylon , saying , This captivity is long : build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite ; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
for thus saith the LORD ; We have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
ask ye now , and see whether a man doth travail with child ? Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
for it shall come to pass in that day , saith the LORD of hosts , that I will break his yoke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
for I am with thee , saith the LORD , to save thee : though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee , yet will I not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished .
for I will restore health unto thee , and I will heal thee of thy wounds , saith the LORD ; because they called thee an Outcast , saying , This is Zion , whom no man seeketh after .
thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will bring again the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have mercy on his dwellingplaces ; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
and their nobles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ? saith the LORD .
at the same time , saith the LORD , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry , Arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God .
for thus saith the LORD ; Sing with gladness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , O LORD , save thy people , the remnant of Israel .
they shall come with weeping , and with supplications will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way , wherein they shall not stumble : for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
hear the word of the LORD , O ye nations , and declare it in the isles afar off , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd doth his flock .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
thus saith the LORD ; refrain thy voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears : for thy work shall be rewarded , saith the LORD ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof , when I shall bring again their captivity ; The LORD bless thee , O habitation of justice , and mountain of holiness .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel ; After those days , saith the LORD , I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their God , and they shall be my people .
thus saith the LORD , which giveth the sun for a light by day , and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar ; The LORD of hosts is his name :
if those ordinances depart from before me , saith the LORD , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
thus saith the LORD ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the LORD .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner .
for Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up , saying , Wherefore dost thou prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ;
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Maaseiah , in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase , before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
for thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land .
Ah Lord GOD ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the Great , the Mighty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even unto this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day ;
and thou hast said unto me , O Lord GOD , Buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses ; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
behold , I am the LORD , the God of all flesh : is there any thing too hard for me ?
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
and the Chaldeans , that fight against this city , shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the houses , upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods , to provoke me to anger .
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the LORD .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and they have turned unto me the back , and not the face : though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction .
and now therefore thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning this city , whereof ye say , It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
they come to fight with the Chaldeans , but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them , and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Again in this place , which is desolate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The LORD our righteousness .
for thus saith the LORD ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
thus saith the LORD ; If ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ;
then will I cast away the seed of Jacob , and David my servant , so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will cause their captivity to return , and have mercy on them .
thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
yet hear the word of the LORD , O Zedekiah king of Judah ; Thus saith the LORD of thee , Thou shalt not die by the sword :
when the king of Babylon 's army fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish , and against Azekah : for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah .
this is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD , after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
that every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a Jew his brother .
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
and Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
behold , I will command , saith the LORD , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant .
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
go unto the house of the Rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the LORD , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habaziniah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
but it came to pass , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father , which he commanded them ; but this people hath not hearkened unto me :
and Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father , and kept all his precepts , and done according unto all that he hath commanded you :
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spake unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
it may be they will present their supplication before the LORD , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the LORD 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Michaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD ,
then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
and they said unto him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears . so Baruch read it in their ears .
so the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elishama the scribe 's chamber . and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
and it came to pass , that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
but the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet : but the LORD hid them .
then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
and I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity ; and I will bring upon them , and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and upon the men of Judah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them ; but they hearkened not .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the LORD , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
and Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Pray now unto the LORD our God for us .
thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me ; Behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
and when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he took Jeremiah the prophet , saying , Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans .
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the LORD ? and Jeremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
then Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashur the son of Malchiah , heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people , saying ,
thus saith the LORD , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
thus saith the LORD , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which shall take it .
then Zedekiah the king said , Behold , he is in your hand : for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Jeremiah sunk in the mire .
now when Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuchs which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
then the king commanded Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
so Ebed @-@ melech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
and Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah , Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords . and Jeremiah did so .
so they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD : and the king said unto Jeremiah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah , If I declare it unto thee , wilt thou not surely put me to death ? and if I give thee counsel , wilt thou not hearken unto me ?
so Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah , saying , As the LORD liveth , that made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the LORD , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
then came all the princes unto Jeremiah , and asked him : and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
and in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
but the Chaldeans ' army pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
but Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
so Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushasban , Rab @-@ saris , and Nergal @-@ sharezer , Rabmag , and all the king of Babylon 's princes ;
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
but I will deliver thee in that day , saith the LORD : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put thy trust in me , saith the LORD .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD , after that Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
and the captain of the guard took Jeremiah , and said unto him , The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
now the LORD hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sinned against the LORD , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
and Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men , saying , Fear not to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men that were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and slew him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him , even with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
and they departed , and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
because of the Chaldeans : for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land .
then all the captains of the forces , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , came near ,
then they said to Jeremiah , The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the LORD : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
and I will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now therefore hear the word of the LORD , ye remnant of Judah ; Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the LORD , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , and upon all the cities of Judah ; and , behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein ,
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all Judah .
and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven , and poured out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her , without our men ?
moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , Hear the word of the LORD , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah , and all the remnant of Judah , that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or theirs .
and this shall be a sign unto you , saith the LORD , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
the word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
thus shalt thou say unto him , The LORD saith thus ; Behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pluck up , even this whole land .
and seekest thou great things for thyself ? seek them not : for , behold , I will bring evil upon all flesh , saith the LORD : but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest .
against Egypt , against the army of Pharaoh @-@ necho king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah .
harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines .
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the LORD .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates .
Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gilead , and take balm , O virgin , the daughter of Egypt : in vain shalt thou use many medicines ; for thou shalt not be cured .
the nations have heard of thy shame , and thy cry hath filled the land : for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet , how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
he made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , Arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
as I live , saith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts , Surely as Tabor is among the mountains , and as Carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , saith the LORD , though it CANNOT be searched ; because they are more than the grasshoppers , and are innumerable .
the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saith ; Behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Pharaoh , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the LORD .
thus saith the LORD ; Behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines , and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth : for the LORD will spoil the Philistines , the remnant of the country of Caphtor .
O thou sword of the LORD , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy Scabbard , rest , and be still .
how can it be quiet , seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon , and against the sea shore ? there hath he appointed it .
against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Woe unto Nebo ! for it is spoiled : Kiriathaim is confounded and taken : Misgab is confounded and dismayed .
there shall be no more praise of Moab : in Heshbon they have devised evil against it ; come , and let us cut it off from being a nation . also thou shalt be cut down , O madmen ; the sword shall pursue thee .
for in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
and the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the LORD hath spoken .
Moab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will send unto him wanderers , that shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles .
Moab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , saith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .

thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
Moab is confounded ; for it is broken down : howl and cry ; and tell ye it in Arnon , that Moab is spoiled ,
the horn of Moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith the LORD .
make ye him drunken : for he magnified himself against the LORD : Moab also shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
we have heard the pride of Moab , ( he is exceeding proud ) his loftiness , and his arrogancy , and his pride , and the haughtiness of his heart .
O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jazer : the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage .
therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir @-@ heres : because the riches that he hath gotten are perished .
for every head shall be bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands shall be cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
Kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men 's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon it , even upon Moab , the year of their visitation , saith the LORD .
howl , O Heshbon , for Ai is spoiled : cry , ye daughters of Rabbah , gird you with sackcloth ; lament , and run to and fro by the hedges ; for their king shall go into captivity , and his priests and his princes together .
and afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon , saith the LORD .
flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , O inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him , the time that I will visit him .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for thus saith the LORD ; Behold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken ; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished ? thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
for I have sworn by myself , saith the LORD , that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
also Edom shall be a desolation : every one that goeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof .
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
concerning Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad : for they have heard evil tidings : they are fainthearted ; there is sorrow on the sea ; it CANNOT be quiet .
Damascus is waxed feeble , and turneth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken her , as a woman in travail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the LORD of hosts .
concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite , thus saith the LORD ; Arise ye , go up to Kedar , and spoil the men of the east .
their tents and their flocks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry unto them , Fear is on every side .
flee , get you far off , dwell deep , O ye inhabitants of Hazor , saith the LORD ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
and their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil : and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners ; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , saith the LORD .
and Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it .
the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against ELAM in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Behold , I will break the bow of ELAM , the chief of their might .
and upon ELAM will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of ELAM shall not come .
for I will cause ELAM to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger , saith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them :
and I will set my throne in ELAM , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the LORD .
the word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet .
declare ye among the nations , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , Babylon is taken , Bel is confounded , Merodach is broken in pieces ; her idols are confounded , her images are broken in pieces .
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
in those days , and in that time , saith the LORD , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together , going and weeping : they shall go , and seek the LORD their God .
my people hath been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their restingplace .
because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate : every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
put yourselves in array against Babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against the LORD .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
Israel is a scattered sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first the king of Assyria hath devoured him ; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
in those days , and in that time , saith the LORD , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : waste and utterly destroy after them , saith the LORD , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the LORD .
slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , saith the Lord GOD of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
and the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together : and all that took them captives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
their Redeemer is strong ; the LORD of hosts is his name : he shall throughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a sword is upon the Chaldeans , saith the LORD , and upon the inhabitants of Babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of graven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
the king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands waxed feeble : anguish took hold of him , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
and will send unto Babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
for Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the LORD 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reacheth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
the LORD hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shields : the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the LORD , the vengeance of his temple .
set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watchmen , prepare the ambushes : for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon .
the LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , Surely I will fill thee with men , as with caterpillers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name .
and I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , saith the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , saith the LORD , which destroyest all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the LORD .
set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashchenaz ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end ,
the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , shall the inhabitant of Zion say ; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea , shall Jerusalem say .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
and Babylon shall become heaps , a dwellingplace for dragons , an astonishment , and an hissing , without an inhabitant .
in their heat I will make their feasts , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the LORD .
and lest your heart faint , and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land ; a rumour shall both come one year , and after that in another year shall come a rumour , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for Babylon : for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north , saith the LORD .
ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the LORD afar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach : shame hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD 's house .
Wherefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will do judgment upon her graven images : and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
a sound of a cry cometh from Babylon , and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans :
because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do roar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered :
because the spoiler is come upon her , even upon Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , every one of their bows is broken : for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite .
and I will make drunk her princes , and her wise men , her captains , and her rulers , and her mighty men : and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
the word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah , the son of Maaseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . and this Seraiah was a quiet prince .
then shalt thou say , O LORD , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
and the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ Adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD , the Chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
the caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
the two pillars , one sea , and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD : the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
and a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
so Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath . thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
this is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty :
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors overtook her between the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feasts : all her gates are desolate : her priests sigh , her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
and from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become vile .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
for these things I weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water , because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy prevailed .
Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
the LORD is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion : he poured out his fury like fire .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the Gentiles : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD .
they say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered thine iniquity , to turn away thy captivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
all that pass by clap their hands at thee ; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem , saying , Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty , The joy of the whole earth ?
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they hiss and gnash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
he hath hedged me about , that I CANNOT get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
it is of the LORD 's mercies that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not .
thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
for the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
they have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven : they pursued us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity : he will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; he will discover thy sins .
servants have ruled over us : there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand .
we Gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
as for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
and when the living creatures went , the wheels went by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and when they went , I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almighty , the voice of speech , as the noise of an host : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and he said unto me , Son of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me : they and their fathers have transgressed against me , even unto this very day .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear : for they are most rebellious .
and when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
and he said unto me , Son of man , cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee . then did I eat it ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
and he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
and go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel @-@ abib , that dwelt by the river of Chebar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and the hand of the LORD was there upon me ; and he said unto me , Arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the LORD stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even Jerusalem :
lie thou also upon thy left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity .
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an Hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with astonishment :
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a barber 's rasor , and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; This is Jerusalem : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comforted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes . I the LORD have spoken it .
when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts , and they shall bereave thee ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee ; and I will bring the sword upon thee . I the LORD have spoken it .
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
yet will I leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the LORD , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Smite with thine hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
so will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath , in all their habitations : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth .
the time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn : for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
they have blown the trumpet , even to make all ready ; but none goeth to the battle : for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
the sword is without , and the pestilence and the famine within : he that is in the field shall die with the sword ; and he that is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it , and defile it .
make a chain : for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancients .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of amber .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he said furthermore unto me , Son of man , seest thou what they do ? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here , that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations .
then said he unto me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had digged in the wall , behold a door .
so I went in and saw ; and behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about .
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
then said he unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , The LORD seeth us not ; the LORD hath forsaken the earth .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD 's house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer 's inkhorn by his side ;
and to the others he said in mine hearing , Go ye after him through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity :
and he said unto them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain : go ye forth . and they went forth , and slew in the city .
and it came to pass , while they were slaying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GOD ! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
then said he unto me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perverseness : for they say , The LORD hath forsaken the earth , and the LORD seeth not .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
and it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
every one had four faces apiece , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
and the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the LORD ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
this city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
and ye shall know that I am the LORD : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you .
therefore say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen , and although I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come .
therefore say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord GOD .
then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
and I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
tell them therefore , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
for I am the LORD : I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in your days , O rebellious house , will I say the word , and will perform it , saith the Lord GOD .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off .
therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord GOD .
ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD .
they have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , The LORD saith : and the LORD hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , The LORD saith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to slay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that hear your lies ?
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Repent , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the LORD have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , saith the Lord GOD .
if I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts :
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord GOD .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour them ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I set my face against them .
and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem ; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan ; thy father was an Amorite , and thy mother an Hittite .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of thy person , in the day that thou wast born .
I clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with Badgers ' skin , and I girded thee about with fine linen , and I covered thee with silk .
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and playedst the harlot because of thy renown , and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of thy garments thou didst take , and deckedst thy high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of thy whoredoms a small matter ,
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the Lord GOD ; )
thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours , great of flesh ; and hast increased thy whoredoms , to provoke me to anger .
behold , therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee , and have diminished thine ordinary food , and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the Philistines , which are ashamed of thy lewd way .
thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
and I will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
before thy wickedness was discovered , as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria , and all that are round about her , the daughters of the Philistines , which despise thee round about .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done , which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; A great eagle with great wings , longwinged , full of feathers , which had divers colours , came unto Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the cedar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers : and , behold , this vine did bend her roots toward him , and shot forth her branches toward him , that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation .
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
say now to the rebellious house , Know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , Behold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand .
as I live , saith the Lord GOD , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose covenant he brake , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; As I live , surely mine oath that he hath despised , and my covenant that he hath broken , even it will I recompense upon his own head .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it : and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
what mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , saith the Lord GOD , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour 's wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman ,
he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept my judgments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the Lord GOD .
if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth the like to any one of these things ,
hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination ,
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
yet say ye , Why ? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Lord GOD : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , O house of Israel ; Is not my way equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
yet saith the house of Israel , The way of the Lord is not equal . O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
therefore I will judge you , O house of Israel , every one according to his ways , saith the Lord GOD . repent , and turn yourselves from all your transgressions ; so iniquity shall not be your ruin .
cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
and say , What is thy mother ? a lioness : she lay down among lions , she nourished her whelps among young lions .
and she brought up one of her whelps : it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the prey ; it devoured men .
and he went up and down among the lions , he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey , and devoured men .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood , planted by the waters : she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
but she was plucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Are ye come to inquire of me ? as I live , saith the Lord GOD , I will not be inquired of by you .
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
and I gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight I brought them out .
yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness .
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all , that ye say , We will be as the heathen , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will I plead with you face to face .
like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I plead with you , saith the Lord GOD .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
I will accept you with your sweet savour , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O ye house of Israel , saith the Lord GOD .
and say to the land of Israel , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD ; Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished :
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon thy thigh .
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
and thou , son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites , and concerning their reproach ; even say thou , The sword , the sword is drawn : for the slaughter it is furbished , to consume because of the glittering :
whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for I the LORD have spoken it .
now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? yea , thou shalt shew her all her abominations .
those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mock thee , which art infamous and much vexed .
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood : and in thee they eat upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they commit lewdness .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' nakedness : in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution .
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood ; thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , saith the Lord GOD .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you .
son of man , say unto her , Thou art the land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter , seeing vanity , and divining lies unto them , saying , Thus saith the Lord GOD , when the LORD hath not spoken .
and I sought for a man among them , that should make up the hedge , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it : but I found none .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I recompensed upon their heads , saith the Lord GOD .
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
and the names of them were Aholah the elder , and Aholibah her sister : and they were mine , and they bare sons and daughters . thus were their names ; Samaria is Aholah , and Jerusalem Aholibah .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
and when her sister Aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms .
girded with girdles upon their loins , exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea , the land of their nativity :
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
and the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
for she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the Paps of thy youth .
there , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
the Babylonians , and all the Chaldeans , Pekod , and Shoa , and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them : all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Thou shalt drink of thy sister 's cup deep and large : thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision ; it containeth much .
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister Samaria .
thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
the LORD said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah ? yea , declare unto them their abominations ;
for when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and , lo , thus have they done in the midst of mine house .
and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness , which put bracelets upon their hands , and beautiful crowns upon their heads .
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
and the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
and utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein .
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein , and whose scum is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall up on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the bloody city ! I will even make the pile for fire great .
heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
then set it empty upon the coals thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on thy shoes upon thy feet , and cover not thy lips , and eat not the bread of men .
also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that whereupon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
and I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast clapped thine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth @-@ jeshimoth , Baal @-@ meon , and Kiriathaim ,
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and revenged himself upon them ;
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword .
and I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord GOD .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethims , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
and I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them .
son of man , because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem , Aha , she is broken that was the gates of the people : she is turned unto me : I shall be replenished , now she is laid waste :
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Tyrus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , a king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and companies , and much people .
he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the Buckler against thee .
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses : and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the LORD have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus ; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
and they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and say to thee , How art thou destroyed , that wast inhabited of seafaring men , the renowned city , which wast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it !
now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
I will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more : though thou be sought for , yet shalt thou never be found again , saith the Lord GOD .
and say unto Tyrus , O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many isles , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; O Tyrus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
they have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir : they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
they of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about , and the Gammadims were in thy towers : they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded in thy fairs .
Javan , tubal , and Meshech , they were thy merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market .
the men of Dedan were thy merchants ; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand : they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony .
Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making : they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds , purple , and broidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and agate .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were thy merchants : they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith , and Pannag , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making , for the multitude of all riches ; in the wine of Helbon , and white wool .
the merchants of Sheba and Raamah , they were thy merchants : they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were thy merchants in all sorts of things , in blue clothes , and broidered work , and in chests of rich apparel , bound with cords , and made of cedar , among thy merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing .
and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and lament over thee , saying , What city is like Tyrus , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
behold , thou art wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from thee :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall defile thy brightness .
wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that slayeth thee .
thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee : thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more .
for I will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel , nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them , that despised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
and they shall dwell safely therein , and shall build houses , and plant vineyards ; yea , they shall dwell with confidence , when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God .
but I will put hooks in thy jaws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
and all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel .
when they took hold of thee by thy hand , thou didst break , and rend all their shoulder : and when they leaned upon thee , thou brakest , and madest all their loins to be at a stand .
and the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the LORD : because he hath said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
behold , therefore I am against thee , and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance , when they shall look after them : but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
and the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
thus saith the LORD ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord GOD .
and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
and I will make Pathros desolate , and will set fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments in No .
and I will pour my fury upon Sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
and I will set fire in Egypt : sin shall have great pain , and No shall be rent asunder , and Noph shall have distresses daily .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
the cedars in the garden of God could not hide him : the fir trees were not like his boughs , and the chestnut trees were not like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
I will also vex the hearts of many people , when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
yea , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee , when I shall brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee .
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her : the daughters of the nations shall lament her : they shall lament for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , saith the Lord GOD .
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him : they are gone down , they lie uncircumcised , slain by the sword .
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword , saith the Lord GOD .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
therefore , O thou son of man , speak unto the house of Israel ; Thus ye speak , saying , If our transgressions and our sins be upon us , and we pine away in them , how should we then live ?
again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten .
Wherefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Ye eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour 's wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
for I will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am the LORD , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed .
son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds ; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves ! should not the shepherds feed the flocks ?
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , will both search my sheep , and seek them out .
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will feed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord GOD .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them ; Behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
and I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord GOD .
and say unto it , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
and thou shalt know that I am the LORD , and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard them .
as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was desolate , so will I do unto thee : thou shalt be desolate , O mount Seir , and all Idumea , even all of it : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
also , thou son of man , prophesy unto the mountains of Israel , and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the LORD :
but ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people of Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
yea , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , saith the Lord GOD .
son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
and I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
and when they entered unto the heathen , whither they went , they profaned my holy name , when they said to them , These are the people of the LORD , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had pity for mine holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen , whither they went .
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
and I will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the heathen , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD , saith the Lord GOD , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
for I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
and I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord GOD , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , O house of Israel .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
and they shall say , This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced , and are inhabited .
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the LORD have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry .
thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones ; Behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and I will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
then he said unto me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried , and our hope is lost : we are cut off for our parts .
therefore prophesy and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it , and performed it , saith the LORD .
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen , whither they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all :
and they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my servant David shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore .
and the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore .
and I will turn thee back , and put hooks into thy jaws , and I will bring thee forth , and all thine army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed with all sorts of armour , even a great company with bucklers and shields , all of them handling swords :
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy bands , and many people with thee .
and thou shalt say , I will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; I will go to them that are at rest , that dwell safely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ,
and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord GOD , that my fury shall come up in my face .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the Lord GOD : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
and I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an overflowing rain , and great hailstones , fire , and brimstone .
thus will I magnify myself , and sanctify myself ; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations , and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
and I will send a fire on Magog , and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more : and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD , the Holy One in Israel .
yea , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord GOD .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the Lord GOD .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me , and brought me thither .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and he brought me thither , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad .
and every little chamber was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
and the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
the space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side , and the space was one cubit on that side : and the little chambers were six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
and there were narrow windows to the little chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the arches : and windows were round about inward : and upon each post were palm trees .
then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
and their windows , and their arches , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof were before them .
and the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits .
after that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and there was a gate in the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits .
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and he said unto me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , which come near to the LORD to minister unto him .
the length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits ; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
and the breadth of the door was ten cubits ; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side , and five cubits on the other side : and he measured the length thereof , forty cubits : and the breadth , twenty cubits .
then went he inward , and measured the post of the door , two cubits ; and the door , six cubits ; and the breadth of the door , seven cubits .
so he measured the length thereof , twenty cubits ; and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said unto me , This is the most holy place .
after he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the building .
and the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cubits .
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the utter court .
and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one entereth into them .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it round about .
he measured the east side with the measuring reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
he measured it by the four sides : it had a wall round about , five hundred reeds long , and five hundred broad , to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits , and the breadth one cubit .
and he said unto me , Son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD ; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they did cleanse it with the bullock .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , saith the Lord GOD .
then said the LORD unto me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the LORD , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD : and I fell upon my face .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house , and ministering to the house : they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance : I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the oblation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Let it suffice you , O princes of Israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice , take away your exactions from my people , saith the Lord GOD .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
and one lamb out of the flock , out of two hundred , out of the fat pastures of Israel ; for a meat offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make reconciliation for them , saith the Lord GOD .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary :
in the first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and an Hin of oil for an ephah .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sabbath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons .
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and in the feast and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock , and ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and an Hin of oil to an ephah .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
then said he unto me , This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , where they shall bake the meat offering ; that they bear them not out into the utter court , to sanctify the people .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ancles .
again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; This shall be the border , whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph shall have two portions .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of Hethlon , as men go to Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazar @-@ hatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
and the border from the sea shall be Hazar @-@ enan , the border of Damascus , and the north northward , and the border of Hamath . and this is the north side .
and the east side ye shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
the west side also shall be the great sea from the border , till a man come over against Hamath . this is the west side .
and by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Asher .
and by the border of Asher , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for Naphtali .
and by the border of Naphtali , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Manasseh .
and by the border of Manasseh , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Ephraim .
and by the border of Ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for Reuben .
and by the border of Reuben , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Judah .
it shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok ; which have kept my charge , which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
and this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites .
and over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
and the five thousand , that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a profane place for the city , for dwelling , and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst thereof .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their portions , saith the Lord GOD .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates northward ; one gate of Reuben , one gate of Judah , one gate of Levi .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Simeon , one gate of Issachar , one gate of Zebulun .
it was round about eighteen thousand measures : and the name of the city from that day shall be , The LORD is there .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with thy servants .
and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack , O king , live for ever : tell thy servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
the king answered and said to the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
but if ye shew the dream , and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour : therefore shew me the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon :
he answered and said to Arioch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so hasty from the king ? then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king 's matter .
the king answered and said to Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen , and the interpretation thereof ?
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded CANNOT the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . thy dream , and the visions of thy head upon thy bed , are these ;
as for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
and wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all . thou art this head of gold .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellers , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up :
thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego . then they brought these men before the king .
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , answered and said to the king , O Nebuchadnezzar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
if it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of thine hand , O king .
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego .
and these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied , and rose up in haste , and spake , and said unto his counsellers , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
he answered and said , Lo , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation :
Wherefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
the king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
Belshazzar , whiles he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , might drink therein .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , drank in them .
then the king 's countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . and the king spake and said unto Daniel , Art thou that Daniel , which art of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Jewry ?
I have even heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thyself , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
O thou king , the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom , and majesty , and glory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not .
then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . now the king spake and said unto Daniel , Thy God whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
and when he came to the den , he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel : and the king spake and said to Daniel , O Daniel , servant of the living God , is thy God , whom thou servest continually , able to deliver thee from the lions ?
my God hath sent his angel , and hath shut the lions ' mouths , that they have not hurt me : forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me ; and also before thee , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
and behold another beast , a second , like to a bear , and it raised up itself on one side , and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it : and they said thus unto it , Arise , devour much flesh .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
as concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time .
and there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and his nails of brass ; which devoured , brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with his feet ;
until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
and he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time .
hitherto is the end of the matter . as for me Daniel , my cogitations much troubled me , and my countenance changed in me : but I kept the matter in my heart .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of ELAM ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
therefore the he goat waxed very great : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised , and prospered .
and I heard a man 's voice between the banks of Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
and he said , Behold , I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shall be .
and his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
and I Daniel fainted , and was sick certain days ; afterward I rose up , and did the king 's business ; and I was astonished at the vision , but none understood it .
in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus , of the seed of the Medes , which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans ;
in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet , that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem .
and I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and supplication , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes :
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets , which spake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
yea , all Israel have transgressed thy law , even by departing , that they might not obey thy voice ; therefore the curse is poured upon us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God , because we have sinned against him .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he spake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of thy servant , and his supplications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive ; O Lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , O my God : for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
and whiles I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth , and I am come to shew thee ; for thou art greatly beloved : therefore understand the matter , and consider the vision .
in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel , whose name was called Belteshazzar ; and the thing was true , but the time appointed was long : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods , with their princes , and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
but his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stirred up , even to his fortress .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
and both these kings ' hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
now when they shall fall , they shall be holpen with a little help : but many shall cleave to them with flatteries .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and one said to the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
and he said , Go thy way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
but go thou thy way till the end be : for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days .
the word of the LORD that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
the beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea . and the LORD said to Hosea , Go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms : for the land hath committed great whoredom , departing from the LORD .
and the LORD said unto him , Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel .
and she conceived again , and bare a daughter . and God said unto him , Call her name Lo @-@ ruhamah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
and I will not have mercy upon her children ; for they be the children of whoredoms .
for their mother hath played the harlot : she that conceived them hath done shamefully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink .
and she shall follow after her lovers , but she shall not overtake them ; and she shall seek them , but shall not find them : then shall she say , I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now .
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
I will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast days , her new moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn feasts .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the LORD .
and I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
and I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Thou art my people ; and they shall say , Thou art my God .
and I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
afterward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the LORD their God , and David their king ; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days .
hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
by swearing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will also forget thy children .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills , under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and your spouses shall commit adultery .
hear ye this , O priests ; and hearken , ye house of Israel ; and give ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a snare on Mizpah , and a net spread upon Tabor .
I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O Ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and Israel is defiled .
they have dealt treacherously against the LORD : for they have begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their portions .
the princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
they are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough , until it be leavened .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their congregation hath heard .
woe unto them ! for they have fled from me : destruction unto them ! because they have transgressed against me : though I have redeemed them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they return , but not to the most High : they are like a deceitful bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt .
set the trumpet to thy mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD , because they have transgressed my covenant , and trespassed against my law .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
for from Israel was it also : the workman made it ; therefore it is not God : but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eat it ; but the LORD accepteth them not ; now will he remember their iniquity , and visit their sins : they shall return to Egypt .
for Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
they shall not dwell in the LORD 's land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria .
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
the days of visitation are come , the days of recompence are come ; Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred .
the watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the prophet is a snare of a Fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
all their wickedness is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their princes are revolters .
Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
my God will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him : and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
the high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , Cover us ; and to the hills , Fall on us .
it is in my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
and Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught , and loveth to tread out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make Ephraim to ride ; Judah shall plow , and Jacob shall break his clods .
ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth @-@ Arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
and the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
and my people are bent to backsliding from me : though they called them to the most High , none at all would exalt him .
they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the LORD .
Ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lies and desolation ; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
he took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God :
yea , he had power over the angel , and prevailed : he wept , and made supplication unto him : he found him in Bethel , and there he spake with us ;
and I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
and Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him .
therefore I will be unto them as a lion : as a leopard by the way will I observe them :
I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .
though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
he hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
be ye ashamed , O ye Husbandmen ; howl , O ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley ; because the harvest of the field is perished .
sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God , and cry unto the LORD ,
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
O LORD , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow ye the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land tremble : for the day of the LORD cometh , for it is nigh at hand ;
a fire devoureth before them ; and behind them a flame burneth : the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape them .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
and the LORD shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
therefore also now , saith the LORD , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning :
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
who knoweth if he will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind him ; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God ?
gather the people , sanctify the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts : let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
yea , the LORD will answer and say unto his people , Behold , I will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith : and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen :
and the floors shall be full of wheat , and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil .
and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the LORD your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the LORD your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions :
and I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered : for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance , as the LORD hath said , and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call .
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat , and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
yea , and what have ye to do with me , O Tyre , and Zidon , and all the coasts of Palestine ? will ye render me a recompence ? and if ye recompence me , swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head ;
proclaim ye this among the Gentiles ; Prepare war , wake up the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up :
let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about .
put ye in the sickle , for the harvest is ripe : come , get you down ; for the press is full , the fats overflow ; for their wickedness is great .
the LORD also shall roar out of Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the LORD will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
the words of Amos , who was among the herdman of Tekoa , which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel , two years before the earthquake .
and he said , The LORD will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of Carmel shall wither .
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to Edom :
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall devour the palaces thereof :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Tyrus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly covenant :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Moab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
yet destroyed I the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
and I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazarites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? saith the LORD .
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith the LORD .
hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the LORD hath not done it ?
publish in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria , and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; An adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palaces shall be spoiled .
that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and I will smite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith the LORD .
hear this word , ye kine of Bashan , that are in the mountain of Samaria , which oppress the poor , which crush the needy , which say to their masters , Bring , and let us drink .
for , lo , he that formeth the mountains , and createth the wind , and declareth unto man what is his thought , that maketh the morning darkness , and treadeth upon the high places of the earth , The LORD , The God of hosts , is his name .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
for thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel , Seek ye me , and ye shall live :
but seek not Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal , and pass not to Beer @-@ sheba : for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and Bethel shall come to nought .
seek the LORD , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in Bethel .
that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong , so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress .
for I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
shall not the day of the LORD be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols .
but ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , saith the LORD , whose name is The God of hosts .
pass ye unto Calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great : then go down to Gath of the Philistines : be they better than these kingdoms ? or their border greater than your border ?
ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that lie upon beds of ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
the Lord GOD hath sworn by himself , saith the LORD the God of hosts , I abhor the excellency of Jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , behold , the LORD commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me : and , behold , the Lord GOD called to contend by fire , and it devoured the great deep , and did eat up a part .
then said I , O Lord GOD , cease , I beseech thee : by whom shall Jacob arise ? for he is small .
and the LORD said unto me , Amos , what seest thou ? and I said , A plumbline . then said the Lord , Behold , I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more :
then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
also Amaziah said unto Amos , O thou seer , go , flee thee away into the land of Judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD : thou sayest , Prophesy not against Israel , and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac .
and he said , Amos , what seest thou ? and I said , A basket of summer fruit . then said the LORD unto me , The end is come upon my people of Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , saith the Lord GOD : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord GOD , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD :
they that swear by the sin of Samaria , and say , Thy god , O Dan , liveth ; and , The manner of Beer @-@ sheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent , and he shall bite them :
and though they go into captivity before their enemies , thence will I command the sword , and it shall slay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
and the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mourn : and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me , O children of Israel ? saith the LORD . have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt ? and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
that they may possess the remnant of Edom , and of all the heathen , which are called by my name , saith the LORD that doeth this .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that the Plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the Treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
and I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
the vision of Obadiah . thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom ; We have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen , Arise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle .
the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high ; that saith in his heart , Who shall bring me down to the ground ?
shall I not in that day , saith the LORD , even destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mount of Esau ?
thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
for the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon thine own head .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau ; and they of the plain the Philistines : and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim , and the fields of Samaria : and Benjamin shall possess Gilead .
and saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau ; and the kingdom shall be the LORD 's .
but Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD , and went down to Joppa ; and he found a ship going to Tarshish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD .
then the mariners were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea , to lighten it of them . but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep .
so the shipmaster came to him , and said unto him , What meanest thou , O sleeper ? arise , call upon thy God , if so be that God will think upon us , that we perish not .
and they said every one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
then said they unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ; What is thine occupation ? and whence comest thou ? what is thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
then said they unto him , What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous .
and he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you .
so they took up Jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , O LORD my God .
so the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
so Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the LORD God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
and it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that God prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah , that he fainted , and wished in himself to die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
and God said to Jonah , doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? and he said , I do well to be angry , even unto death .
then said the LORD , Thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
for the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the transgression of Jacob ? is it not Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? are they not Jerusalem ?
pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Saphir , having thy shame naked : the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @-@ ezel ; he shall receive of you his standing .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good : but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem .
yet will I bring an heir unto thee , O inhabitant of Mareshah : he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel .
woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the LORD straitened ? are these his doings ? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the LORD , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
and he shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afar off ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever .
but they know not the thoughts of the LORD , neither understand they his counsel : for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD , in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
and they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof : thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian , when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
and the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD , as the showers upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sons of men .
and I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen , such as they have not heard .
hear ye now what the LORD saith ; Arise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear thy voice .
hear ye , O mountains , the LORD 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth : for the LORD hath a controversy with his people , and he will plead with Israel .
O my people , what have I done unto thee ? and wherein have I wearied thee ? testify against me .
wherewith shall I come before the LORD , and bow myself before the high God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves of a year old ?
will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
he hath shewed thee , O man , what is good ; and what doth the LORD require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God ?
the LORD 's voice crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that is abominable ?
thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
for the statutes of Omri are kept , and all the works of the house of Ahab , and ye walk in their counsels ; that I should make thee a desolation , and the inhabitants thereof an hissing : therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people .
the good man is perished out of the earth : and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
the best of them is as a brier : the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge : the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh ; now shall be their perplexity .
therefore I will look unto the LORD ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the LORD shall be a light unto me .
then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , Where is the LORD thy God ? mine eyes shall behold her : now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets .
in that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of Carmel : let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old .
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things .
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
who is a God like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? he retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy .
thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob , and the mercy to Abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
God is jealous , and the LORD revengeth ; the LORD revengeth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth wrath for his enemies .
he rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers : Bashan languisheth , and Carmel , and the flower of Lebanon languisheth .
the mountains quake at him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at his presence , yea , the world , and all that dwell therein .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
what do ye imagine against the LORD ? he will make an utter end : affliction shall not rise up the second time .
for while they be folden together as thorns , and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry .
thus saith the LORD : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more .
behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ! O Judah , keep thy solemn feasts , perform thy vows : for the wicked shall no more pass through thee ; he is utterly cut off .
for the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel : for the emptiers have emptied them out , and marred their vine branches .
the chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightnings .
he shall recount his worthies : they shall stumble in their walk ; they shall make hast to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepared .
and Huzzab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up , and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves , tabering upon their breasts .
she is empty , and void , and waste : and the heart melteth , and the knees smite together , and much pain is in all loins , and the faces of them all gather blackness .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feedingplace of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whelp , and none made them afraid ?
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with ravin .
because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot , the mistress of witchcrafts , that selleth nations through her whoredoms , and families through her witchcrafts .
behold , I am against thee , saith the LORD of hosts ; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face , and I will shew the nations thy nakedness , and the kingdoms thy shame .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , Nineveh is laid waste : who will bemoan her ? whence shall I seek comforters for thee ?
art thou better than populous No , that was situate among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
yet was she carried away , she went into captivity : her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , thy people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies : the fire shall devour thy bars .
there shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm : make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locusts .
thy shepherds slumber , O king of Assyria : thy nobles shall dwell in the dust : thy people is scattered upon the mountains , and no man gathereth them .
there is no healing of thy bruise ; thy wound is grievous : all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee : for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually ?
why dost thou shew me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ? for spoiling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up strife and contention .
for , lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
and they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , imputing this his power unto his god .
art thou not from everlasting , O LORD my God , mine Holy One ? we shall not die . O LORD , thou hast ordained them for judgment ; and , O mighty God , thou hast established them for correction .
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am reproved .
and the LORD answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
behold , is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , that puttest thy bottle to him , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
thou art filled with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy foreskin be uncovered : the cup of the LORD 's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory .
O LORD , I have heard thy speech , and was afraid : O LORD , revive thy work in the midst of the years , in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy .
God came from Teman , and the Holy One from mount Paran . Selah . his glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
and his brightness was as the light ; he had horns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
he stood , and measured the earth : he beheld , and drove asunder the nations ; and the everlasting mountains were scattered , the perpetual hills did bow : his ways are everlasting .
thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages : they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me : their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly .
although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vines ; the labour of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stalls :
the word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hizkiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops ; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD , and that swear by Malcham ;
in the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill their masters ' houses with violence and deceit .
howl , ye inhabitants of Maktesh , for all the merchant people are cut down ; all they that bear silver are cut off .
and it shall come to pass at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their lees : that say in their heart , The LORD will not do good , neither will he do evil .
the great day of the LORD is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the LORD : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities , and against the high towers .
and I will bring distress upon men , that they shall walk like blind men , because they have sinned against the LORD : and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as the dung .
neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD 's wrath ; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy : for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land .
before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the chaff , before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you , before the day of the LORD 's anger come upon you .
seek ye the LORD , all ye meek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD 's anger .
and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah ; they shall feed thereupon : in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening : for the LORD their God shall visit them , and turn away their captivity .
I have heard the reproach of Moab , and the revilings of the children of Ammon , whereby they have reproached my people , and magnified themselves against their border .
this shall they have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts .
her prophets are light and treacherous persons : her priests have polluted the sanctuary , they have done violence to the law .
I have cut off the nations : their towers are desolate ; I made their streets waste , that none passeth by : their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is none inhabitant .
from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
sing , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O Israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem .
the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
at that time will I bring you again , even in the time that I gather you : for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when I turn back your captivity before your eyes , saith the LORD .
in the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , saying ,
thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , saying , This people say , The time is not come , the time that the LORD 's house should be built .
go up to the mountain , and bring wood , and build the house ; and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , saith the LORD .
then spake Haggai the LORD 's messenger in the LORD 's message unto the people , saying , I am with you , saith the LORD .
and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with glory , saith the LORD of hosts .
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former , saith the LORD of hosts : and in this place will I give peace , saith the LORD of hosts .
then answered Haggai , and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith the LORD ; and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is unclean .
and now , I pray you , consider from this day and upward , from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD :
since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith the LORD .
is the seed yet in the barn ? yea , as yet the vine , and the fig tree , and the pomegranate , and the olive tree , hath not brought forth : from this day will I bless you .
and again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
in that day , saith the LORD of hosts , will I take thee , O Zerubbabel , my servant , the son of Shealtiel , saith the LORD , and will make thee as a signet : for I have chosen thee , saith the LORD of hosts .
therefore say thou unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Turn ye unto me , saith the LORD of hosts , and I will turn unto you , saith the LORD of hosts .
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Sebat , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying ,
I saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , speckled , and white .
then said I , O my lord , what are these ? and the angel that talked with me said unto me , I will shew thee what these be .
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said , These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
then the angel of the LORD answered and said , O LORD of hosts , how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years ?
so the angel that communed with me said unto me , Cry thou , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy .
and I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease : for I was but a little displeased , and they helped forward the affliction .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies : my house shall be built in it , saith the LORD of hosts , and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem .
cry yet , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion , and shall yet choose Jerusalem .
and I said unto the angel that talked with me , What be these ? and he answered me , These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem .
then said I , whither goest thou ? and he said unto me , To measure Jerusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
and said unto him , Run , speak to this young man , saying , Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein :
for thus saith the LORD of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
for , behold , I will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me .
sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion : for , lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the LORD .
and many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
be silent , O all flesh , before the LORD : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation .
and the LORD said unto Satan , The LORD rebuke thee , O Satan ; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee : is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ?
and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the filthy garments from him . and unto him he said , Behold , I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and I will clothe thee with change of raiment .
and I said , Let them set a fair mitre upon his head . so they set a fair mitre upon his head , and clothed him with garments . and the angel of the LORD stood by .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; If thou wilt walk in my ways , and if thou wilt keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my courts , and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by .
hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH .
for behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua ; upon one stone shall be seven eyes : behold , I will engrave the graving thereof , saith the LORD of hosts , and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day .
and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me , saying , What are these , my lord ?
then he answered and spake unto me , saying , This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the LORD of hosts .
the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you .
then answered I , and said unto him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
and I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
then said he , These are the two anointed ones , that stand by the LORD of the whole earth .
and he said unto me , What seest thou ? and I answered , I see a flying roll ; the length thereof is twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof ten cubits .
I will bring it forth , saith the LORD of hosts , and it shall enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name : and it shall remain in the midst of his house , and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof .
then the angel that talked with me went forth , and said unto me , Lift up now thine eyes , and see what is this that goeth forth .
and I said , What is it ? and he said , This is an ephah that goeth forth . he said moreover , This is their resemblance through all the earth .
and he said , This is wickedness . and he cast it into the midst of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stork : and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four chariots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
then cried he upon me , and spake unto me , saying , Behold , these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country .
take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah ;
even he shall build the temple of the LORD ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD , and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you . and this shall come to pass , if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God .
and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these so many years ?
speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities thereof round about her , when men inhabited the south and the plain ?
thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , saying , Execute true judgment , and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother :
therefore it is come to pass , that as he cried , and they would not hear ; so they cried , and I would not hear , saith the LORD of hosts :
thus saith the LORD ; I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days , should it also be marvellous in mine eyes ? saith the LORD of hosts .
and I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness .
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
and it shall come to pass , that as ye were a curse among the heathen , O house of Judah , and house of Israel ; so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let your hands be strong .
for thus saith the LORD of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith the LORD of hosts , and I repented not :
so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah : fear ye not .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD , and to seek the LORD of hosts : I will go also .
the burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach , and Damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of Israel , shall be toward the LORD .
and Tyrus did build herself a strong hold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
behold , the Lord will cast her out , and he will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire .
Ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and Ekron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
and a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
and I will encamp about mine house because of the army , because of him that passeth by , and because of him that returneth : and no oppressor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O daughter of Jerusalem : behold , thy King cometh unto thee : he is just , and having salvation ; lowly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal of an ass .
when I have bent Judah for me , filled the bow with Ephraim , and raised up thy sons , O Zion , against thy sons , O Greece , and made thee as the sword of a mighty man .
and the LORD shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds of the south .
the LORD of hosts shall defend them ; and they shall devour , and subdue with sling stones ; and they shall drink , and make a noise as through wine ; and they shall be filled like bowls , and as the corners of the altar .
and the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an ensign upon his land .
for how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the maids .
for the idols have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie , and have told false dreams ; they comfort in vain : therefore they went their way as a flock , they were troubled , because there was no shepherd .
mine anger was kindled against the shepherds , and I punished the goats : for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah , and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle .
and they shall be as mighty men , which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the LORD is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
and they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : yea , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Labanon ; and place shall not be found for them .
and I will strengthen them in the LORD ; and they shall walk up and down in his name , saith the LORD .
whose possessors slay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , Blessed be the LORD ; for I am rich : and their own shepherds pity them not .
and I will feed the flock of slaughter , even you , O poor of the flock . and I took unto me two staves ; the one I called Beauty , and the other I called Bands ; and I fed the flock .
and I took my staff , even Beauty , and cut it assunder , that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD .
and the LORD said unto me , Cast it unto the potter : a goodly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD .
behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem .
and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it .
and the governors of Judah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God .
in that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the angel of the LORD before them .
in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem , as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
and the land shall mourn , every family apart ; the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
the family of the house of Levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of Shimei apart , and their wives apart ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
and one shall say unto him , What are these wounds in thine hands ? then he shall answer , Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
awake , O sword , against my shepherd , and against the man that is my fellow , saith the LORD of hosts : smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered : and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , saith the LORD , two parts therein shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left therein .
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished ; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
and it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the LORD of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
and if the family of Egypt go not up , and come not , that have no rain ; there shall be the plague , wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD ; and the pots in the LORD 's house shall be like the bowl 's before the altar .
yea , every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts : and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them , and seethe therein : and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts .
and now , I pray you , beseech God that he will be gracious unto us : this hath been by your means : will he regard your persons ? saith the LORD of hosts .
and ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant might be with Levi , saith the LORD of hosts .
the law of truth was in his mouth , and iniquity was not found in his lips : he walked with me in peace and equity , and did turn many away from iniquity .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth : for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi , saith the LORD of hosts .
Judah hath dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
the LORD will cut off the man that doeth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tabernacles of Jacob , and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts .
and this have ye done again , covering the altar of the LORD with tears , with weeping , and with crying out , insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more , or receiveth it with good will at your hand .
for the LORD , the God of Israel , saith that he hateth putting away : for one covereth violence with his garment , saith the LORD of hosts : therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treacherously .
behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to this temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the LORD of hosts .
but who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like Fullers ' soap :
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver : and he shall purify the sons of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness .
even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances , and have not kept them . return unto me , and I will return unto you , saith the LORD of hosts . but ye said , Wherein shall we return ?
your words have been stout against me , saith the LORD . yet ye say , What have we spoken so much against thee ?
ye have said , It is vain to serve God : and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance , and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts ?
then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another : and the LORD hearkened , and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD , and that thought upon his name .
and they shall be mine , saith the LORD of hosts , in that day when I make up my jewels ; and I will spare them , as a man spareth his own son that serveth him .
then shall ye return , and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not .
but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as calves of the stall .
and ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this , saith the LORD of hosts .
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins .
then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
and thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
and he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
when he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
and was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
in Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
but when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
and he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost , and with fire :
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
and Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffered him .
and Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
and when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
but he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
and Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
for I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
and if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
and if thy right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
but I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloke also .
give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
and when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
but thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
but when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen .
moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
no man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye CANNOT serve God and mammon .
therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . are ye not much better than they ?
and why take ye thought for raiment ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
and , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . and immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
and Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
for I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
when Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
and Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
and Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
and he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
but the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
and , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
for whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
but when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
and as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me . and he arose , and followed him .
but when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
but go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
while he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
but Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
and when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
he said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . and they laughed him to scorn .
and when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou Son of David , have mercy on us .
and when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? they said unto him , Yea , Lord .
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
these twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
what I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
he that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
and as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
and thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
all things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
but when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
how he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles .
a bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
but if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
and whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
but I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
but he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas :
for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
but he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
for whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
and he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
he answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
but he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
the enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
and when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
and they were offended in him . but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
and said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
for Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
when Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
and Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
and when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
and he said , Come . and when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
but when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
for God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
but ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
and honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . and if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
but he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
and great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
and his disciples say unto him , whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
he answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas . and he left them , and departed .
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
from that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
but he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
for what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
while he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
but I say unto you , That Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
and while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . and they were exceeding sorry .
at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
and said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
and if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
but if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
and if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
but the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
so when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
and his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
and it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ;
the Pharisees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
and he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
and said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
they say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
he saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
and I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
his disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
but he said unto them , All men CANNOT receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
for there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
but Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
the young man saith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
they say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
so when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
and he said unto her , What wilt thou ? she saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
but Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? they say unto him , We are able .
but Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
and Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
and when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then sent Jesus two disciples ,
and if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
and said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David ; they were sore displeased ,
and when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . and presently the fig tree withered away .
and when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away !
and when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
and Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
the baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
whether of them twain did the will of his father ? they say unto him , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
for John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
hear another parable : there was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to Husbandmen , and went into a far country :
but when the Husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
they say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other Husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord 's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
but when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
and no man was able to answer him a word , neither Durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness .
and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
and Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
and as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
for as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark ,
but know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
and at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
and while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
his lord said unto him , Well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
his lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
and I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
for I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
and the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
but when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
when Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
and said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
and he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
and he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
the Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
and as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
for this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
and he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt .
watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
and , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smote off his ear .
then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
in that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
but all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
and said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
and when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
and after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
and Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly .
when the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood . and they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that .
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
and Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? and Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
when he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
the governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? they said , Barabbas .
Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? they all say unto him , Let him be crucified .
and the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
and after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
and when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
and saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . if thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
he saved others ; himself he CANNOT save . if he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
he trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elias .
and straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
when the even was come , there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
and Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . Amen .
and there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
and John was clothed with camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
and preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
and it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
and there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
and he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
and saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
and when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
and they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
and when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
and there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
and saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
but he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
when Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
and as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . and he arose and followed him .
and it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
when Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they CANNOT fast .
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
and he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
and when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
and he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
for he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
and unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
and James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder :
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
and he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
and some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
and other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
and these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
and have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
and these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
and he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
and he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
but when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
and he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
and he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . and the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
and he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the most high God ? I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
and forthwith Jesus gave them leave . and the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
and they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
Howbeit Jesus suffered him not , but saith unto him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
and he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
while he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ?
as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
and they laughed him to scorn . but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
and straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great astonishment .
is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Juda , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? and they were offended at him .
but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
and king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
others said , That it is Elias . and others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
for Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her .
for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
and when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
and he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
and Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
and when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
he answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . and they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
and he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
then came together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from Jerusalem .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
and when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . and many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
for laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
and he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it CANNOT defile him ;
and from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
the woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
and he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
and were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
and if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
and the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
and he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
and when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? and they said , Seven .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? and Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
and he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
and he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
and after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
and Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
and he answered and told them , Elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
but I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
and when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
and he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ? and he said , Of a child .
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
when Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
and the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
but Jesus said , forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
and if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
and if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
and they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
and Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
but Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
and they said unto him , We can . and Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
but Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
and they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
and Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
and when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
and Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
and he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
and say unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
and Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
and they answered and said unto Jesus , We CANNOT tell . and Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
but those Husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
and they brought it . and he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? and they said unto him , Caesar 's .
and as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
he is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
and one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
and the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and the scribe said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is none other but he :
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
and when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . and no man after that Durst ask him any question .
and Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David ?
for David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
and he said unto them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
and Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
and as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains :
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
and except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
and then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
for false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
for the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
and the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
and wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
and he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
the Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
and he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
and they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
and he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
and he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
and immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
and he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
and as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
and Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
we heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
but he held his peace , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
and some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
and when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
and the second time the cock crew . and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept .
and there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
but Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? and they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
and so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
and when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
and when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
Joseph of Arimathaea , and honourable counseller , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
and he saith unto them , Be not affrighted : ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
and she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
and these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
they shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
and they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen .
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
but the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
and Zacharias said unto the angel , whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary .
and the angel came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
and , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS .
and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
and , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
and she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the Lord was with him .
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
and Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
and she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
and , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
and he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
and Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
and there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
but they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene ,
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
he answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? and he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
and as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
and Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
and the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
and Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
and the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
and Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
and he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
and all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . and they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ?
but I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
but unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
and Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . and when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
and they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
and devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
and Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
and they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
when Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
and so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . and Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
and it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . and immediately the leprosy departed from him .
and he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .
and after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Follow me .
and they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
and he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
and he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
and certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
and Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
how he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
and it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
but he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . and he arose and stood forth .
then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
and when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man 's sake .
woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
but love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
and he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
but he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
and a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
and when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
then Jesus went with them . and when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
and it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
and when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
and he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . and he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
and there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
when the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
and when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
and all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
and the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
and , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
and stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . and he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
a sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . and when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
and that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
and it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
and he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
but as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
and they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
and he said unto them , Where is your faith ? and they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
when he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee , torment me not .
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . and he suffered them .
then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
while he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
but when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
and of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
and the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
but he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . and they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
and it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
but I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
and it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . but while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and Jesus said unto him , foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
and Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
but into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
for I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
and he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
and Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
and went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
and on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
but Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
but one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
and it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples .
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
no man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
if thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
and as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
but woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
and he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye Lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
and as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
and whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven .
and when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
and he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
and he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
but God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
and he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
if then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
and this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
but and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
but he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . for unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
but I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
and he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is .
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
and when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
the Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
and ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? and he said unto them ,
then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
but he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
the same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
and he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
and Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
and answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
and they all with one consent began to make excuse . the first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
and another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
what man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
and when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . and he divided unto them his living .
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
and when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
and when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
and the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
but the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
and he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
and he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
and he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
and he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I CANNOT dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
so he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
and he said , An hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? and he said , An hundred measures of wheat . and he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
and I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
no servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye CANNOT serve God and mammon .
and he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
the law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
there was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
and beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you CANNOT ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come !
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
but which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
and will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
and fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
for as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
and they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? and he said unto them , Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together .
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
but Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
and he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake ,
then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
and they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
and he cried , saying , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
and immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
and when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
and when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
and Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
and as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
and another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
for I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
and he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow :
saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
and he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and he taught daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
and spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to Husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a servant to the Husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the Husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
but when the Husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
so they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
he shall come and destroy these Husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . and when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
and he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
and they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
and they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly :
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man 's brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
and the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
and Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
and David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
which devour widows ' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation .
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
as for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
and they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and PESTILENCES ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
and he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
and he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
for I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
and he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
and truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
and the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
for I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
and he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
and the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? and he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
and they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
and Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
no , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
and they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
and he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him , and let him go .
and they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
and the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
and all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
and the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
and returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
and the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days ?
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
but they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . and he went in to tarry with them .
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
and , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
the same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
and the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
and this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
and they asked him , What then ? art thou Elias ? and he saith , I am not . art thou that prophet ? and he answered , No .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
and they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
and I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? they said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
he first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
and he brought him to Jesus . and when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , Believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
and he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
and there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . and they filled them up to the brim .
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
and when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
and said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house an house of merchandise .
then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he CANNOT see the kingdom of God .
Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ?
Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he CANNOT enter into the kingdom of God .
the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
and they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him .
then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
the woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
but the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
the woman saith unto him , I know that Messias cometh , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
the woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
and he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
and many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
and said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . and they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
when Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
he answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
and he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
for the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
but I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
and the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
when Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
there is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
and Jesus said , Make the men sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
and Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
and this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
and they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ?
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
as the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
it is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
the Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
( but this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
when Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
these words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
and he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? and Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
and he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
they answered him , We be Abraham 's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
they answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
ye do the deeds of your father . then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
and his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
and said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
he answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight .
then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? and there was a division among them .
they say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? he said , He is a prophet .
these words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
he answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
the man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
and Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
and Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
to him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
the thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
but he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
no man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this commandment have I received of my Father .
then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? if thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
my Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand .
say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
but if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
when Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
she saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
there they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
he that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
the people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him .
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
the people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
he hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
and if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
and supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ;
Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
so after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
when Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
for some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .
in my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , shew us the Father ?
Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
and I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world CANNOT receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
but that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . arise , let us go hence .
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
these things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
but when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
all things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . verily , verily , I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
these things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world .
these words spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee :
for I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
and now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
and I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
they answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . and Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
and led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
and Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? he saith , I am not .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
and when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
and Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . they said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? he denied it , and said , I am not .
one of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king . to this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? and when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
but ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . and Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
and from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar 's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
when Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
and it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
but they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? the chief priest answered , We have no king but Caesar .
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :
and Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , JESUS OF Nazareth THE KING OF THE JEWS .
then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
when Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
and he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
and after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . he came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
and he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
and they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? she saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
and when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? she , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
and after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
then saith he to Thomas , reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . they say unto him , We also go with thee . they went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
and he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . they cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God :
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
and he said unto them , It is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his own power .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea , and in Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
which also said , Ye men of Galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? this same Jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
and it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
and they prayed , and said , Thou , Lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship , from which Judas by transgression fell , that he might go to his own place .
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speak Galilaeans ?
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Ye men of Judaea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
for these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , saith God , I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
and I will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
ye men of Israel , hear these words ; Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
for David speaketh concerning him , I foresaw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
for David is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly , that God hath made that same Jesus , whom ye have crucified , both Lord and Christ .
then Peter said unto them , Repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost .
then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart ,
praising God , and having favour with all the people . and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
and a certain man lame from his mother 's womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful , to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength .
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
and when Peter saw it , he answered unto the people , Ye men of Israel , why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so earnestly on us , as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk ?
the God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
and as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem ; and we CANNOT deny it .
but Peter and John answered and said unto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God , judge ye .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
for of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
by stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
but Peter said , Ananias , why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
saying , The prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
saying , Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man 's blood upon us .
after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
and they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
and in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
Wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
and he said , Men , brethren , and fathers , hearken ; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he dwelt in Charran ,
then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and dwelt in Charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
and were carried over into Sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem .
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
he brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us :
to whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt ,
saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
yea , ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles , whom God drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of David ;
but he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
and cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet , whose name was Saul .
and Saul was consenting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria , except the apostles .
as for Saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
but there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is the great power of God .
and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Ghost :
and when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money ,
then answered Simon , and said , Pray ye to the Lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip , saying , Arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza , which is desert .
and he arose and went : and , behold , a man of Ethiopia , an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem for to worship ,
and he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? and he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
and Saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest ,
and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
and he said , Who art thou , Lord ? and the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
and he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? and the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
and there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias . and he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
and the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the street which is called Straight , and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul , of Tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth ,
but the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles , and kings , and the children of Israel :
and Ananias went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest , hath sent me , that thou mightest receive thy sight , and be filled with the Holy Ghost .
and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
but Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
and there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
and forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
then Peter arose and went with them . when he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made , while she was with them .
but Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him , and saying unto him , Cornelius .
and when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? and he said unto him , Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God .
and when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
on the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , Behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and the morrow after they entered into Caesarea . and Cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
and as Peter was coming in , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
therefore came I unto you without gainsaying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
and Cornelius said , Four days ago I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
and said , Cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
immediately therefore I sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God .
the word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him .
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ;
then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life .
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
and some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , which , when they were come to Antioch , spake unto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Jesus .
for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the Lord .
and there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea :
which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him .
and when Herod would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
and , behold , the angel of the Lord came upon him , and a light shined in the prison : and he smote Peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , Arise up quickly . and his chains fell off from his hands .
and the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , and bind on thy sandals . and so he did . and he saith unto him , Cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
and he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
but he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said , Go shew these things unto James , and to the brethren . and he departed , and went into another place .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
so they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
and when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius PAULUS , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
and said , O full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
and now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
but when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
then Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , Men of Israel , and ye that fear God , give audience .
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until Samuel the prophet .
and afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of CIS , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
of this man 's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour , Jesus :
men and brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and whosoever among you feareth God , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm , Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
and by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for I work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles .
and when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
they were ware of it , and fled unto Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
said with a loud voice , Stand upright on thy feet . and he leaped and walked .
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
confirming the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
and thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
and when there had been much disputing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
that the residue of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the Lord , who doeth all these things .
and they wrote letters by them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia :
forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
for it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas , Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord , and see how they do .
and the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ;
now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia , and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
after they were come to Mysia , they assayed to go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
and a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us .
and from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
and a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira , which worshipped God , heard us : whose heart the Lord opened , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul .
and when she was baptized , and her household , she besought us , saying , If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and abide there . and she constrained us .
the same followed Paul and us , and cried , saying , These men are the servants of the most high God , which shew unto us the way of salvation .
and this did she many days . but Paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
and when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas ,
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in God with all his house .
but Paul said unto them , They have beaten us openly uncondemned , being Romans , and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out privily ? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out .
and they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
and Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
opening and alleging , that Christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom I preach unto you , is Christ .
whom Jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , one Jesus .
and when they had taken security of Jason , and of the other , they let them go .
therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
and then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
and they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
then Paul stood in the midst of Mars ' hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man 's device .
and the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked : and others said , We will hear thee again of this matter .
and because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
and when they opposed themselves , and blasphemed , he shook his raiment , and said unto them , Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean : from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles .
and he departed thence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named Justus , one that worshipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
and Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
and when Paul was now about to open his mouth , Gallio said unto the Jews , If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness , O ye Jews , reason would that I should bear with you :
then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and Gallio cared for none of those things .
and Paul after this tarried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and sailed thence into Syria , and with him Priscilla and Aquila ; having shorn his head in Cenchrea : for he had a vow .
and he came to Ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
and when he had landed at Caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to Antioch .
and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
and when he was disposed to pass into Achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
and it came to pass , that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus : and finding certain disciples ,
he said unto them , Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him , We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost .
but when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
then certain of the vagabond Jews , Exorcists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth .
and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
but when they knew that he was a Jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
and there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timotheus ; and of Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .
and upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
and there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
for Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
but none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
I have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , It is more blessed to give than to receive .
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him unto the ship .
now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
and when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry .
what is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
as touching the Gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
then Paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
( for they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
and as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
and some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
and as Paul was to be led into the castle , he said unto the chief captain , May I speak unto thee ? who said , canst thou speak Greek ?
art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
( and when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
as also the high priest doth bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem , for to be punished .
and I answered , Who art thou , Lord ? and he said unto me , I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom thou persecutest .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and I said , What shall I do , Lord ? and the Lord said unto me , Arise , and go into Damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
and when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
and one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there ,
came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , Brother Saul , receive thy sight . and the same hour I looked up upon him .
and he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that Just One , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the Lord .
and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
and as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with thongs , Paul said unto the centurion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and uncondemned ?
when the centurion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , Take heed what thou doest : for this man is a Roman .
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
on the morrow , because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews , he loosed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought Paul down , and set him before them .
and the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
and there arose a great cry : and the scribes that were of the Pharisees ' part arose , and strove , saying , We find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against God .
and the night following the Lord stood by him , and said , Be of good cheer , Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at Rome .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul .
and when Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
then Paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , Bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
and he said , The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council , as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
and he called unto him two centurions , saying , Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea , and horsemen threescore and ten , and spearmen two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
and provide them beasts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe unto Felix the governor .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
and after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named Tertullus , who informed the governor against Paul .
we accept it always , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thankfulness .
notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
but this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
and have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
and he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
and after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : Wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
but after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
but Festus , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
then said Paul , I stand at Caesar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
for if I be an offender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them . I appeal unto Caesar .
then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , Hast thou appealed unto Caesar ? unto Caesar shalt thou go .
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
and because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
and Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . Wherefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write .
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews :
especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . for which hope 's sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
and when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
but rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
to open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .
but shewed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
that Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the Gentiles .
and as he thus spake for himself , Festus said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad .
then said Agrippa unto Festus , This man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto Caesar .
and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
and entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
and when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
and when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
and now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
and sounded , and found it twenty Fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen Fathoms .
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
and while the day was coming on , Paul besought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
but the centurion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
and the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a viper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously .
and it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
and from thence we fetched a compass , and came to Rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to Puteoli :
and from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum , and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
saying , Go unto this people , and say , Hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and not perceive :
for the heart of this people is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
and when he had said these words , the Jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
to all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
for I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
for circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
but he is a Jew , which is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit , and not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God .
and not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose damnation is just .
their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
to declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus .
is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Gentiles ? yes , of the Gentiles also :
cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
how was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara 's womb :
he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
and being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
for if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
but not as the offence , so also is the free gift . for if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
and not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
for if by one man 's offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
for as by one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
God forbid . how shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
for when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
but now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? God forbid . nay , I had not known sin , but by the law : for I had not known lust , except the law had said , Thou shalt not covet .
was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . but sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
for I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
but I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
O wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord . so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God ; but with the flesh the law of sin .
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
and if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint @-@ heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
for the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which CANNOT be uttered .
for whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I say the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost ,
for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved :
Wherefore ? because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . for they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
but what saith it ? the word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
but I say , Have they not heard ? yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
but I say , Did not Israel know ? first Moses saith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
I say then , Hath God cast away his people ? God forbid . for I also am an Israelite , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
Lord , they have killed thy prophets , and digged down thine altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
but what saith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
( according as it is written , God hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ; ) unto this day .
I say then , Have they stumbled that they should fall ? God forbid : but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles , for to provoke them to jealousy .
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . be not highminded , but fear :
behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
and they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for God is able to Graff them in again .
and so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob :
as concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sakes .
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
and be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord .
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . for there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
for for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
who art thou that judgest another man 's servant ? to his own master he standeth or falleth . yea , he shall be Holden up : for God is able to make him stand .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
but why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
for meat destroy not the work of God . all things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
for even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
and I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
for I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
that ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen , and my fellowprisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
but now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
unto the church of God which is at Corinth , to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both theirs and ours :
now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
but unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
and I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
but as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
for what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
for who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he may instruct him ? but we have the mind of Christ .
for we are labourers together with God : ye are God 's husbandry , ye are God 's building .
according to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
if any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . for it is written , He taketh the wise in their own craftiness .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
for I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
we are fools for Christ 's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
for though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
for this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ , as I teach every where in every church .
what will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
for I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but God shall destroy both it and them . now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
what ? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ? for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
for I would that all men were even as I myself . but every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
and unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
but if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
for what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
but as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . and so ordain I in all churches .
now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
but this I say , brethren , the time is short : it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ;
and they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
and this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
but to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
but meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
if I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? for our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
if others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
for though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
for if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
what is my reward then ? verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
moreover , brethren , I would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
now all these things happened unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
for we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all partakers of that one bread .
all things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man 's conscience ?
now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
but if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
after the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . and the rest will I set in order when I come .
Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
if the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? if the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
and the eye CANNOT say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
that there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .
and though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
when I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
but if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
how is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , everyone of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . let all things be done unto edifying .
if any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
after that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
but by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
but every man in his own order : Christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that are Christ 's at his coming .
for he hath put all things under his feet . but when he saith , all things are put under him , it is manifest that he is excepted , which did put all things under him .
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we die .
and that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
all flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
it is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
and so it is written , The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit .
therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
and it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go .
as touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
the churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
for our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you @-@ ward .
and to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
for if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
to whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ 's gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
to the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
but if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
for if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
and not as Moses , which put a Vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
but their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same Vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which Vail is done away in Christ .
but we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
for we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
we having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
for all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God .
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
for the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
for he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the Lord , and touch not the unclean thing ; and I will receive you ,
having therefore these promises , dearly beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
for though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a godly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
and herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
and we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
whether any do inquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be inquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
for I know the forwardness of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent am bold toward you :
but I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
( for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
but we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
but though I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things .
are they Hebrews ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I CANNOT tell ; or whether out of the body , I CANNOT tell : God knoweth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
and I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I CANNOT tell : God knoweth ; )
of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
for though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
and lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed .
this is the third time I am coming to you . in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established .
I told you before , and foretell you , as if I were present , the second time ; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned , and to all other , that , if I come again , I will not spare :
for though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
finally , brethren , farewell . be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
but though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
as we said before , so say I now again , If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed .
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
but when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
and when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
for before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
but if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
and this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , CANNOT disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
Wherefore then serveth the law ? it was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
and if ye be Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;
they zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
for it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is agar .
for it is written , Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband .
nevertheless what saith the scripture ? cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
so then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
and I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
this I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh .
for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye CANNOT do the things that ye would .
now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; Adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
and let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
but God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ :
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
in whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself :
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power ,
far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
and hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church ,
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
for we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
Wherefore remember , that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands ;
that at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
for he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward :
Wherefore he saith , When he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
and he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
and grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
for this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul and Timotheus , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
what then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
according to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
but if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
for I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
but made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
that ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
but ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
though I might also have confidence in the flesh . if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
and be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
therefore , my brethren dearly beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand fast in the Lord , my dearly beloved .
those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
but I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
we give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
which is come unto you , as it is in all the world ; and bringeth forth fruit , as it doth also in you , since the day ye heard of it , and knew the grace of God in truth :
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
for by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
and you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; whereof I Paul am made a minister ;
to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles ; which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
for though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
and not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God .
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to ordinances ,
if ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
but now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ;
forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
withal praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
all my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord :
with Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , saluteth you , always labouring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
for I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
and say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfil it .
and ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Ghost :
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God @-@ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
but even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
so being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
for ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
for ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews :
who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
and sent Timotheus , our brother , and minister of God , and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
for this cause , when I could no longer forbear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
furthermore then we beseech you , brethren , and exhort you by the Lord Jesus , that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God , so ye would abound more and more .
for this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
but let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
and we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
see that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
we are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
now we beseech you , brethren , by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and by our gathering together unto him ,
that ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of Christ is at hand .
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God , or that is worshipped ; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
but we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth :
therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
as I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
for whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
this is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
for kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
but I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
a bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
and let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
but if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils ;
forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
for every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving :
neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
but if any widow have children or nephews , let them learn first to shew piety at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God .
now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
if any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
for the scripture saith , Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn . and , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
some men 's sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
I give thee charge in the sight of God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession ;
who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting . Amen .
I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
for the which cause I also suffer these things : nevertheless I am not ashamed : for I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day .
hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
this thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
the Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
wherein I suffer trouble , as an evil doer , even unto bonds ; but the word of God is not bound .
therefore I endure all things for the elect 's sakes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
it is a faithful saying : for if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him :
of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
if a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
and the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
all scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
but watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry .
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .
the cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
to Titus , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
for a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of God ; not selfwilled , not soon angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ;
but a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ;
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Ghost ;
that being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
this is a faithful saying , and these things I will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works . these things are good and profitable unto men .
when I shall send Artemas unto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis : for I have determined there to winter .
Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
yet for love 's sake I rather beseech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
for unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? and again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
and again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
and of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
but unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
and , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
but to which of the angels said he at any time , Sit on my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
but one in a certain place testified , saying , What is man , that thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man , that thou visitest him ?
thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands :
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
and Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , They do alway err in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
for we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
for some , when they had heard , did provoke : Howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
but with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
as he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
for this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ?
for the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
for finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
for if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
for a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
but call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
by faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
but now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
they were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
( of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
and the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
whose voice then shook the earth : but now he hath promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven .
let your conversation be without covetousness ; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee .
so that we may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
for the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
but the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God CANNOT be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , Sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
for he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
and one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . for what is your life ? it is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory :
searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
and if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man 's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever .
but the word of the Lord endureth for ever . and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
to whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
but and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
for Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
as every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
if ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
but let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters .
yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
the church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .
Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
for if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
but he that lacketh these things is blind , and CANNOT see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
and many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
for if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
but these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
having eyes full of adultery , and that CANNOT cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us @-@ ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
and account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
but grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . to him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
( for the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
he that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
my little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
and whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
and this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
we are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
in this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
if a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
this is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . and it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
if we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
for many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . this is a deceiver and an antichrist .
whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
for I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
Wherefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the church .
beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . he that doeth good is of God : but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
for there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
and the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , Durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
to execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
to the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . Amen .
the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . even so , Amen .
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
and his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
and hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
but I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
but unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
after this I looked , and , behold , a door was opened in heaven : and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me ; which said , Come up hither , and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
and the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
and one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Juda , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
and they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
and the four beasts said , Amen . and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
and I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals , and I heard , as it were the noise of thunder , one of the four beasts saying , Come and see .
and when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . and I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
and white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
for the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
and I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb .
and all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
saying , Amen : blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen .
and I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
and when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
and another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
and the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
the first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
and the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
and the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
and the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Give me the little book . and he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
and I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
these are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
and the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
and the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
and the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
and he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and I looked , and , lo , a Lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their foreheads .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of Harpers harping with their harps :
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were redeemed from the earth .
and I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people ,
saying with a loud voice , Fear God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
and there followed another angel , saying , Babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
and the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand ,
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours ; and their works do follow them .
and I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
and I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
and after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
and the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
and I heard the angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent : and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials , and talked with me , saying unto me , Come hither ; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters :
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
and upon her forehead was a name written , MYSTERY , BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF harlots AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH .
and the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
these shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
and I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
how much she hath glorified herself , and lived deliciously , so much torment and sorrow give her : for she saith in her heart , I sit a queen , and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow .
therefore shall her plagues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire : for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her .
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
and saying , Alas , alas , that great city , that was clothed in fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold , and precious stones , and pearls !
for in one hour so great riches is come to nought . and every shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood afar off ,
and they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and wailing , saying , Alas , alas , that great city , wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is she made desolate .
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia ; Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne , saying , Amen ; Alleluia .
and a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
and I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF Lords .
and I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
and cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed a little season .
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying , Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , and be their God .
and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away .
and he that sat upon the throne said , Behold , I make all things new . and he said unto me , Write : for these words are true and faithful .
he that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
but the fearful , and unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death .
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the bride , the Lamb 's wife .
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and shewed me that great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
and the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand furlongs . the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the Lamb is the light thereof .
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
in the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
and there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and he said unto me , These sayings are faithful and true : and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
then saith he unto me , See thou do it not : for I am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren the prophets , and of them which keep the sayings of this book : worship God .
and , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
