dairy farms have to effect a complete re@@ organisation at each step of the milk production chain , with a view to making it more profitable , that is more efficient and more pro@@ du@@ c ­ tive .
dairy farming is practically non @@@ -@@ @ existent among private farmers because of the poor pr@@ of ­ itability of the activity : few have been motivated to start this type of farming and most of those who set up faced serious difficulties .
the large size of the herds , the lack of training or profit @@@ -@@ @ sharing incentives for the workers have not fav@@ oured the search for solutions to improve the productivity and profitability of the dairy farms .
milk can only be produced on the basis of the protein and cere@@ al intake ( naturally poor in protein ) and the cows ' own bodily reserves ( which are often already reduced at the start of the winter ) .
this region enjoys a climate that is well suited to dairy farming ; the soils are less rich than those found in Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad and Kursk but the rainfall here is more abundant ( with 600 to 800 mm ) .
efficient use of the gra@@ zing will also guarantee the durability of the temporary past@@ ure over a period of 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 years while in the con@@ verse situation it would not last more than a year .

one possible source of funding for the implementation of projects requiring capital investments may be grants from international donor agencies such as the World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) .
the laboratory also offers services to those outside the market who wish to obtain a health quality certificate and stamp for car@@ c@@ asses that will then be sold from other locations in the region .
to ensure that an efficient flow of goods is achieved and that safety is maintained in the market , it is important to separate the action of re @@@ -@@ @ stoc@@ king pit@@ ches from the selling activity .
at certain stages of the market 's development , up to 70 % of participating wholes@@ al@@ ers were newly @@@ -@@ @ formed businesses using the market opportunity to secure a footh@@ old on the first run@@ g of an entrepreneurial ladder .
however , difficulties can arise with the appointment of the market management , as they will find it difficult to balance the needs of investors with those of the municipality representing the needs of the community as a whole .
these who have already copied the market in some way have found the Tog@@ li@@ atti costs to be a good guide , especially at the stage of securing municipal funds and putting the building work out to tender .
it is for the leaders of subsequent market schemes to decide for them selves the driving forces in their own market , and to ensure that the people around them share in that vision .

such a simple distinction as this often becomes a problem if each company does not commun@@ i ­ C@@ ate its own In@@ ten@@ tions clearly or does not try to find out what the other company 's in@@ ten ­ tions are .
again , this is because the lender wants to ensure that the financial state of the tar ­ get company does not deteriorate rapidly after the target company has the lender 's money .

we , here in this strange East / West interface of Berlin and Pot@@ s@@ dam , have noticed that there are some people who even feel threatened by the ending of the separation between East and West .
it is the aim of this conference to high ­ light the possibilities for , and limits to , East ­ West exchange programmes and to promote encounters and cooperation among young people of all European cou@@ n ­ tries .
also , as a community of Western states we are charged with strengthening , within the framework of the EC and the Council of Euro pe , our bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation with our Central and Eastern European neighbours .

finally , it was only in 1985 that the European Council adopted the People 's Europe conclusions recomm@@ ending that youth exchanges within the community be promoted and a fully ­ fledged network of exchanges within and between the Member States set up .
not all the youth leaders have experience of exchanges ; some do not know , or are not very familiar with , the countries with which they wish to organize the exchanges ; others have no exchange partners .
the B@@ D@@ Y has taken up a position in the political centre and its chairman , Ivan A@@ tan@@ as@@ sov , founded the daily news ­ paper , " Fax , " which was , however , only short@@ lived .
furthermore , we are also trying to render assistance in order to overcome the lack of opportunities for young people to take part in international life by way of personal contacts and to contribute to international understanding .
however , it should be noted that since the fall of the total@@ i ­ T@@ Ari@@ an regime , opportunities for young people , especially in this particular area , have mar ­ k@@ edly improved .
in the Czech Republic , international contacts between children and young people have been implemented in the framework of government programmes for the support and pro ­ tec@@ tion of the younger generation since 1991 .
although the economy is in a transitional period , and the financial situation is difficult , one must nonetheless create prop@@ itious conditions for young people 's development : they are , after all , society 's future .
parallel to this , a transformation of the traditional welfare organizations to fully profession@@ a ­ li@@ zed institutions took place , and with it , the growth of educational institutions for the training of professional social workers .
• Using budget allocations to give support solely to the programmes of non ­ political youth associations and foundations , while at the same time ensuring the possibility of co ­ operation with the youth organizations of political parties .
the Government of the Russian Federation has prepared a decree on the organization of the summer recreation programme in 1993 , and work is proceeding on the reorganization of the Or@@ ly@@ on@@ ok and O@@ ke@@ an national children 's holiday centres .
at the same time , however , the possibilities for them to develop this experience , to satisfy their vital interests and requirements , which are necessary in order to support a family , do not exist .
when there is no real mechanism for the state to support its youth , a constant decline in living standards of the young people occurs , which is reflected through the level of their self ­ appraisal .
however , under conditions of economic destabilization , gal@@ lo@@ ping inflation and further impover@@ ishment of a considerable part of the population , the political problems in the orient@@ ations of young people are being forced into the background .
the level of criticism and non ­ compliance with the events and the acts of the authorities , which previously took place in the Ukraine , the countries ó@@ f the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , remains quite high .
under the influence of many social ­ economic and other factors , the value orient@@ ations of students are considerably changing from being all ­ humane to more mercanti@@ le and Pr@@ ag@@ ma ­ tic .
there was a massive need for the right advice and , although the readiness to break new ground was rather tentative to begin with , the chance to travel and get involved in international youth exchange programmes proved irresisti@@ ble in the end .
two , three years have passed and we realize that the readiness in the Western part of Germany to share , in order to f@@ ür@@ ther the development of a common Germany , has deci@@ dedly decreased .
for even within the EC , youth work is still a very underdeveloped area , despite the brave Stru@@ g ­ gle on the part of Mr. T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is , and we will have to develop this area jointly in terms of these new tasks .
I believe that one C@@ AN@@ NOT simply concentrate on an exchange between regions , but one will rather have to take a good look at the deep gap between West and East , that is , the deep gap between rich and poor .
it was under these circumstances that the idea to introduce a new str@@ and of activities , after the model of pilot projects implemented within the framework of the European Community Youth for Europe Programme , was developed .
at this point , let us elaborate on the expectations the par@@ tic@@ i ­ pants of our working group had concerning future youth ex@@ ch@@ an ­ ge programmes of youth ex@@ ch@@ an ­ ge between East and West .
one of the main problems arising in cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural encounter situations is that of knowing how to go about planning joint projects , while still managing to take into account the diversity of the feelings and cultural behavi@@ ours present .

in a third category of countries ( Algeria , Albania , Azerbaijan , Croatia , Montenegro and Tunisia ) contact hours or a combination of contact hours and student workload are still used as a reference to define the credits .
these steps have been defined by the Eur@@ y@@ dice net@@ work@@ 19@@ on the basis of the recommended ten steps scale proposed by the Bologna Fol@@ low @@@ -@@ @ up Group 's ( B@@ F@@ U@@ G ) working group on Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works led by the Council of Europe .
in higher education , quality assurance can be defined as policies , procedures and practices that are designed to achieve , maintain or enhance quality as it is understood in a specific context .
in Israel , for the moment , a government @@@ -@@ @ dependent body , the Quality Assessment Unit in the Council for Higher Education , is mainly responsible for evaluating and ac@@ crediting study programmes .
the programme is integrated into the European Union 's ' Neigh@@ bour@@ hood ' , ' En@@ larg@@ ement ' and ' Development ' policies , which aim to promote prosperity , stability and security in the targeted regions .
the Bologna Process is the product of a series of meetings of Ministers responsible for higher education at which policy decisions have been taken with the goal to establish a European Higher Education Area by 2010 .
in Western Europe , emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use fell by 3 % between 1990 and 1995 , due to economic recession , the restructuring of industry in Germany and the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation .
natural gas is also found In dry se@@ ams , not in association with oil , as in the extensive Russian and NIS region gas fields . detection and extraction techniques are similar to those for oil .
the main uses of coal today are : • as fuel in ther@@ mo @@@ -@@ @ electric power stations • within the iron and steel industry , both as raw material for coke and as a fuel for sm@@ elt ­ ing and heating processes .
the generation process converts the chemical energy of the fuel into thermal energy ( steam ) which Is then conden@@ sed through the turbine giving mechanical energy , and final ­ ly the generator converts this turning into electricity .
some of the reasons are a lack of good insulation In buildings , poor efficiency of ageing municipal heating networks and the inability ( or incentive ) for individual families to control their heating use .
examples of the type of Information that can be us@@ efully collected are given in the previous sections of this hand@@ book and in the box below . energy statistics can be compiled from many other sources .

should a co @@@ -@@ @ operative make advanced payments for the products delivered by the me@@ m ­ bers - but this Is unlikely at least at the beginning - It would also require a corresponding level of working capital .

as far as the members ' produce is concerned , a co @@@ -@@ @ operative which Is just starting , lack ­ ing working capital , can hardly make advance payments to the producers at delivery time .
the executive manager 's activity should be closely controlled by the producers and there should be a mutual trust and dialogue between the President and the Executive Manager . these are the keys to an efficient management .
cash flow state ­ ments for the co @@@ -@@ @ operative as well as for the farms attest to the capacity of the co @@@ -@@ @ O@@ per ­ ative to face its operating expenses and re@@ payments .

improved treatment of wastewater has resulted in improvement of the state of water bodies with a decrease in concentration of pollutants over the past ten years , although nit@@ rate pollution continues to be a problem in many regions .
different authorities may be responsible for different aspects of water policy , with water ministries dealing with water quantity and environmental ministries managing water quality . the Ministry of Health also sometimes monitors water quality .
national waste law often attributes a monopoly to these public waste collection services for the collection and treatment of particular waste fr@@ actions , particularly when it comes to the disposal of household waste .
the cost of dispos@@ ing of waste must be borne by the holder who has waste handled by a collector or dispos@@ er ; and / or by the previous holder or the producer of the product from which the waste came .
in order to prepare and control the proper management of waste , these authorities have to acquire an overview of the quantities and qualities of the wastes produced in the states and have to devise options for waste collections and treatment .
member States shall prepare action plans indicating the measures to be taken in the short term to reduce pollution , in the event there is a risk of the limit values and / or alert thresholds being exceeded .

the third cycle corresponds to doctoral studies ; a doc@@ torate is usually obtained after at least three years of extensive research , under the supervision of a thesis director , and the writing and successful thesis defence .
diplomas awarded by certain private higher education institutions are not as yet recognised by the state due to the fact that the draft law , dealing with this particular issue , needs to be ratified by parliament to become law .
