only the following partner countries can participate in T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is in the academic year 1999 / 2000 : Armenia , Azerbaijan , , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Moldova , Mongolia , Russian Federation , Turkmenistan , Ukraine , Uzbekistan .
0 Compact Projects in all countries
the Russian Federation and Ukraine may act as Coordinator of a project .
please note that the deadline for submitting J@@ EP , CP and M@@ J@@ EP applications is the 5 February 1999 ( date as per post@@ mark ) .
the T@@ emp@@ us Programme is the trans @@@ -@@ @ European cooperation scheme for higher education . adopted by the Council of Ministers of the European Union ( EU ) on 7 May 1990 , the programme was addressed to the central and eastern European countries ( T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are ) .
on 29 April 1993 a new four @@@ -@@ @ year phase from the academic year 1994 / 95 and the inclusion of the New Independent States and Mongolia were approved .
T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is and T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are were seen as two parallel but separate schemes in administrative and budgetary terms .
on 21 November 199@@ 61 both T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are and T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is were extended for a further two years from the academic year 1998 / 99 .
the T@@ emp@@ us Programme has been designed as a major human resources development scheme aiming to strengthen the ability of the higher education sector to meet national policies and priorities .
T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is is a " bottom @@@ -@@ @ up " programme responsive to the specific needs of individual institutions in the partner countries .
projects are formulated by universities in the partner countries in cooperation with their counterparts from the European Union , where the EU universities contribute their know @@@ -@@ @ how and experience .
T@@ emp@@ us is administered by the European Commission ( D@@ G XX@@ II - Education , Training and Youth ) with technical assistance provided by the T@@ emp@@ us Department of the European Training Foundation .
national T@@ emp@@ us Information Points , established by the authorities in each of the partner countries , assist in providing information about the programme .
a separate Guide for Appl@@ ic@@ ants for T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are ( which applies to the partner countries of the central and eastern Europe ) , including detailed information , guidelines and application forms may be obtained on request from the European Training Foundation .
objectives OF TE@@ MP@@ US T@@ AC@@ IS
the T@@ ac@@ is Programme supports the process of transformation to market economies and democratic societies in the New Independent States and Mongolia .
within this framework , the T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is objective is to promote the development of the higher education systems in these partner countries .
T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is does this by providing financing to encourage interaction and balanced cooperation between higher education institutions in the partner countries and the European Union .
within the context of higher education cooperation , T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is seeks to address specifically :
♦ issues of curriculum development and renewal in priority areas ;
♦ the reform of higher education structures and institutions and their management ;
project applications to the T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is Programme must fall under the priority subject areas specific to the partner country concerned .
only applications which comply with the priority areas specific to each partner country will be taken into consideration for financing .
on a annual or two @@@ -@@ @ yearly basis , the partner countries receive a national allocation from the overall T@@ ac@@ is budget .
the national authorities , in consultation with the European Commission , then reserve a part of their national allocation for T@@ emp@@ us .
for the two year period 1998 / 99 the following amounts were allocated : Armenia EC@@ U 1 million , Azerbaijan EC@@ U 1 million , Georgia EC@@ U 1.4 million , Mongolia EC@@ U 1.2 million , Uzbekistan EC@@ U 2.2 million .
Ukraine received EC@@ U 5 million in 1996 , EC@@ U 4 million in 1997 and EC@@ U 4 million in 1998 while the Russian Federation received EC@@ U 7.@@ 65 million for 1996 , EC@@ U 8 million for 1997 and EC@@ U 13 million for 1998 .
only the following partner countries can apply for T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is projects in 1999 :
in addition to the EU Member States , other countries belonging to the G@@ 24 Group may also participate :
T@@ emp@@ us funds may only be used for activities between EU Member States and the partner countries .
non @@@ -@@ @ EU G@@ 24 countries must fund their own participation in T@@ emp@@ us projects .
T@@ emp@@ us projects are prepared and implemented by con@@ sor@@ tia of higher education institutions in keeping with the " bottom @@@ -@@ @ up " approach which character@@ ises T@@ emp@@ us .
in a Compact Project , the second partner country institution can be an enterprise or an organisation instead of a higher education institution ;
♦ two or three EU higher education institutions based at least in two different EU Member States .
optionally , a consortium may also include :
♦ one higher education institution based in another G@@ 24 country ( see the list in chapter 5 ) .
it is important that each consortium member 's contribution to the project be clearly indicated in the application .
EU institutions within a consortium shall represent a coherent pool of resources , responding to the needs of the NIS and Mongolian partner institutions involved .
the letter from the partner country institution shall , in addition , indicate how the project fits in with the development strategy of the institution .
in the European Union :
♦ all classical and technical multi @@@ -@@ @ disciplinary universities which have a state licence , regardless of the kind of funding ;
♦ other higher education institutions may be considered eligible only if this is indicated in the respective annex on country @@@ -@@ @ specific priorities ;
♦ other types of organisations ( enterprises , government agencies , networks and associations , etc . ) can be consortium members only within the framework of the Compact Projects .
institutions that are mainly research @@@ -@@ @ oriented or attached to / part of an Academy of Science are not eligible to be consortium members .
they may only participate as teachers , staff or students attached to an institution member of a consortium .
only con@@ sor@@ tia working with the Russian Federation , Kazakhstan . Ukraine and Uzbekistan may apply for a To@@ int European Project ( TE@@ P ) .
joint European Projects are three @@@ -@@ @ year projects whose overall aim is to contribute to the long @@@ -@@ @ term development and renewal of the partner countries ' higher education .
in the shorter @@@ -@@ @ term , they aim to create centres disseminating good practice to other institutions in the partner countries .
course development can be undertaken at graduate or post@@ graduate level , as well as for the introduction of short @@@ -@@ @ cycle , practically oriented higher education courses .
the introduction of new management practices and structures in the partner country at the institutional level or faculty level may also be part of a J@@ EP .
however , this should represent only a component of a J@@ EP , while course development and related activities should remain the core of the project .
it will also make clear what are the needs that the project will address in order to overcome the identified problems .
this analysis should form the basis of the J@@ EP proposal .
all countries may apply for a Compact Project ( CP ) .
compact Projects can last up to two years and they should address precisely defined and short @@@ -@@ @ term needs of the partner institutions .
they should be self contained and concentrate on one objective which can be achieved by the end of the project .
compact Projects may be drawn up according to one of the following three models .
University Management and External Relations
♦ Introduction of new management practices and structures in the partner country institutions , for example at institute or faculty level .
the aim is to improve the short@@ and long @@@ -@@ @ term planning capacity of the institution , the management of day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day operations , the effectiveness of international relation offices , etc .
♦ Im@@ pro@@ vement of universities ' international relations and contact building . this may include the strengthening of international networks , the implementation of well@@ thought out mobility plans to establish new international contacts , etc .
♦ Streng@@ th@@ ening of links between education institutions in the partner countries .
♦ Streng@@ th@@ ening of links between the partner institution and other parties in the partner countries .
compact Projects in this area should focus on curriculum development in one subject area among the priorities listed in the respective country annex .
compact Project applications may cover the following areas :
drawing up of a dissemination strategy and methods ( e.g. publishing , distribution , presentations , training sessions , thematic workshops , distance learning materials ) .
mobility Joint European Projects
Russian Federation , Georgia and Ukraine only .
mobility Joint European Projects are also , provi@@ sionally , foreseen for Ukraine in 1999 .
for further information , please refer to chapter 17 of this Guide .
the overall long @@@ -@@ @ term objective of a project should be to support the development of the higher education systems in the partner countries , as stated in the T@@ emp@@ us objectives in section 2 .
bearing in mind the long @@@ -@@ @ term objective and in line with the bottom @@@ -@@ @ up approach , con@@ sor@@ tia themselves will define the project specific ( or short @@@ -@@ @ term ) objective .
con@@ sor@@ tia will also have to identify the specific outcomes that will be generated during the project and that will lead to the achievement of the project objective .
the outcomes to be produced during the project implementation should be described in concrete terms .
the outcomes should be limited in number and as well be specific , measurable , and realistic given the project duration .
the activities should be in line with the list given in section 9 .
the project application should give details of the physical and non @@@ -@@ @ physical inputs or resources needed for the activities to take place .
assumptions and risks
you should be aware of any external situation which is beyond the control of the project that might affect the success of the project .
although the consortium will not be able to address these problems , they should be identified as assumptions and / or risk factors .
the above factors ( the project logic ) should be decided and agreed upon by all consortium members . this will help you to reach a common understanding of the project objective and expected outcomes or results .
in the Application Form you will find a Log@@ ical Framework Matrix which you should fill in to summar@@ ise the logic of your project and its key elements .
♦ ( re ) training and practical placements for teaching / administrative staff from the partner country institutions ;

other costs include the following :
♦ dissemination costs , namely costs related to the execution of a dissemination event , e.g. the hire of premises from outside the consortium institutions , for a particular event ;
♦ institutional costs only if related to student mobility ( it applies to J@@ E@@ Ps only ) .
for study periods abroad it is important to note that the host university can claim institutional costs to cover the costs incurred as a result of receiving students from abroad .
the T@@ emp@@ us contribution to university institutional costs is allocated as follows :
the contractor provides a detailed calculation of all general expenses up to 5 % of the total grant awarded .
mobility grants will be awarded mainly to university teaching staff and administr@@ ati@@ ve@@ 2 staff .
on a limited scale and if appropriate , teachers , trainers or experts from non@@ - consortium members who are invited to contribute their particular expertise to the project activities may also benefit from a mobility grant .

the Staff Mob@@ ility Co@@ sts comprises two components , costs of stay and travel costs .
costs of stay include reasonably priced accommodation and subsistence , local transport ( bus and taxis ) and reasonable daily allowance for mis@@ cell@@ aneous expenses while abroad .
based on the number of mobility flows foreseen by each project application , the cost of stay are computer calculated by applying the following amounts ( in EC@@ U ) .
for projects which involve high cost destinations in the Russian Federation ( i.e. Moscow , St. Petersburg ) an actual cost system can be used .
travel costs cover transport costs at national level , and international flights at economy fare to and from the partner country .
please note that an important difference exists , i.e. student mobility is only eligible for J@@ E@@ Ps .
compact Projects will not include student mobility .
con@@ sor@@ tia should give priority to those students who intend to undertake teaching assignment at their university afterwards .
grants may be awarded to under@@ graduate students ( in their final phase of study ) , and to post@@ graduate students undertaking further study ( including doctoral students ) .
the period abroad should form an integral part of students ' studies and it should contribute to their home degree or qualification .
grants may be awarded for the following three types of activity :
♦ Particip@@ ation in short intensive courses ( strictly targeted training in a specific subject area for a well defined target group of partner country students at post@@ graduate level ) .
duration of student mobility can not be less that a month and not more than a year .
student Mob@@ ility Gran@@ ts are intended to cover costs of stay and travel costs .

transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
before 1989 education and training in Central and Eastern Europe was designed to suit the context of centrally planned economies .
under the Com@@ econ@@ 1@@ arrangements , there was a division of labour whereby one country would provide the other countries with supplies of particular commodities .
this led to an over @@@ -@@ @ concentration , in particular countries , of some industries and the neg@@ ligence of others .
furthermore , areas such as the crafts , commerce , banking , accoun@@ tancy and insurance had remained underdeveloped .
training was very often directed towards a life @@@ -@@ @ time job .
crafts trades and service professions were seriously neglected .
standards of equipment in vocational education institutions reflected the poor technological standard of industry itself .
links between schools and large state enterprises were traditionally well @@@ -@@ @ established .
they were dismantled , as the latter closed down their training facilities due to a lack of resources .
from 1989 , political and economic changes have been fundamental and more far @@@ -@@ @ reaching than any in the past .
those changes encompass all aspects of life , from the democratic structure of society , to the privatisation of enterprises , to the subjects studied by young people and adults at educational establishments .
COM@@ EC@@ ON = Council for Mut@@ ual Econom@@ ic@@ Assistance , the former economic organisation establis@@ lied to encourage trade and friendly relations among nine communist countries including t@@ lie Soviet Union
a high proportion of local enterprises are facing serious financial crises .
the restructuring or closing down of companies will inevitably lead to increasing unemployment - a phenomenon largely unknown in former times .
while growth has resumed in some of these countries , others continue to face difficulties .
in 1997 GDP in Estonia grew by 10.@@ 9 % , and in Latvia and Lithuania by 6 % .
most countries continued their positive growth in 1998 .
there was an increase of 3.8 % and 3.4 % of real GDP in the candidate countries between the first and second quarters of 1997 and 1998 .
in Romania and Bulgaria , GDP in 1997 declined .
moreover , output in 1998 in most Central and Eastern European countries ( except for Poland and Slovenia ) remains below the pre @@@ -@@ @ transition level .
the drastic reduction in demand for labour following the collapse in output has been reflected both in lower employment and lower real wages .
with the exception of the Czech Republic the rate of unemployment is very high throughout the region .
this drop in employment has been accompanied by a reduction in the labour force , and many people who were previously in the labour market are now out of it .

vocational education and training at the start of reforms
given the similarity of the political and economic systems , Central and Eastern European countries shared a common starting base for reforms in 1989 / 90 .
education and training systems were characterised by similar structures and underlying organisational patterns .
at the start of reforms , this split of responsibilities was an obstacle to both the design of an overall reform policy framework and a major restructuring of the school network .
initiative , self @@@ -@@ @ responsibility and entrepreneurial skills were not particularly encouraged .
social partners , i.e. employers ' and employees ' representatives , and other key stakeholders were not involved in policy discussions and decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
the vocational education model
vocational schools provided education and training for the equivalent of grades from 9 or 10 to 12 .
Post@@ secondary technical schools - the higher level of vocational institutes - offered programmes lasting between 2.5 and 4 years .
as vocational education was always perceived as a continuation of general education , there was often a pre @@@ -@@ @ dominance of general secondary school subjects in vocational education programmes which left too little scope for the vocational theory subjects .
frequently , students therefore had only limited vocational skills when they sought employment .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in t@@ lie countries of Central and Eastern Europe
however , a common feature the countries in question shared was the relatively low prestige of vocational education within society .
traditionally , costs for vocational education and training were shared between the state and the big ( state ) enterprises .
before 1990 state investment in education in relation to GDP was relatively high .
this education " advance " still paid off in the first years of reform .
however , the proportion of the budget ear@@ marked for vocational education and training was traditionally quite low .
furthermore , an additional financial burden was added to the state budget due to the withdrawal of companies from their former involvement in training .
funds were by and large sufficient to cover the running costs of the system , such as teacher salaries , operational and maintenance costs of schools , etc .
however , only a very small budget was available for actual investment in the sector .
given the numerous reform tasks in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 / 90 , a major increase of funds for the vocational education and training sector could not be expected .
assistance from foreign donors was needed without which most of the countries would have been barely able to kick @@@ -@@ @ start reforms .
role of companies and human resource planning
while the schools cat@@ ered for the general subjects and provided a basic introduction to working life via school workshops , the companies were the location for practical training .
training took place within a dual system where the vocational school was often part of a state @@@ -@@ @ owned company .
the breakdown of the planned system and the subsequent break down of contacts between schools and companies had serious implications for the provision of specific vocational training .
the traditional sources disappeared and the state did not have the resources to compensate for this loss .
the result was schools with outdated and poor equipment , uncertain of their new role .
when the system collapsed in 1989 / 90 , there was great uncertainty as to which qualifications should be produced .
as a result , they frequently concentrated on theory and on delivering academic teaching for technical vocational education .
there were three significantly different types of teachers in the vocational schools .
they had , parallel to their particular subject , studied ped@@ ag@@ ogy at university .
these general teachers lacked the necessary practical knowledge and skills and were , of course , not trained in new technologies .
the ' academ@@ isation ' of vocational education due particularly to this group of teachers .
the vocational subject theory teachers had a technical education , e.g. engineering , and some had taken in @@@ -@@ @ service training courses in ped@@ ag@@ ogy at a university .
the qualifications of the three groups of teachers and trainers / masters represented a significant barrier to the development of the vocational education system .
the main challenge in Central and Eastern Europe was to integrate these teaching groups and create a more holistic system of preserv@@ ice and in @@@ -@@ @ service teacher and trainer training .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
today there are huge differences in the state of play of vocational education and training reforms and these gaps are expected to widen .
the countries are not only facing the challenge of upgrading the skills of workers and managers or retraining unemployed .
another serious problem is the fact that the initial vocational education and training system does not adequately respond to skill needs of the labour market .
the number of people below 25 years of age who are registered as unemployed exceeds the average unemployment rate of the given country .
it ranges between 7 % ( Czech Republic ) and 36 % ( Bulgaria ) of the overall age co@@ hor@@ t@@ 4 .

another problem is the growing number of young people who leave school without any formal qualification at all .

more specifically , the situation with respect to drop @@@ -@@ @ outs from both compulsory and post@@ compulsory education is as follows :

there is a lack of policy measures to address the needs of early school leav@@ ers .
compared to other Central and Eastern European countries , total drop @@@ -@@ @ out rates for all education are low but higher with respect to vocational education and training .
1.4 % of students do not complete their studies in general secondary education , compared to 2.6 % of those in secondary technical schools and 10.@@ 1 % of those in secondary vocational education ( figures from 1997 ) .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
in 1995 the rates were 6.@@ 9 % , 10.@@ 7 % and 18.@@ 1 % , respectively .
the high drop @@@ -@@ @ out rate from secondary vocational education and training may be attributed to its relative un@@ attractiveness and bleak prospects on the labour market .
to date , no special programmes to address the needs of these groups have been designed .
compulsory education has been increased to 10 years of schooling ( until the age of 16 ) .
the drop @@@ -@@ @ out rate is high with 20 % at secondary level altogether .
the situation is even worse for the Rom@@ any minority group with 50 % .
although overall en@@ rol@@ ment in vocational education and training decreased by 4 % in 1997 / 98 , the number of young people continuing studies in vocational education and training with a maturity examination has increased significantly .
4 % of basic education and 24 % of general secondary education graduates do not continue their studies .
participation of young people in vocational education ( 16 % in 1996 ) is lower than the EU average ( 24 % ) .
education participation of 14 @@@ -@@ @ 19 year olds was 73 % in 1996 compared to an EU average of 84 % .
there is a lack of measures to tackle the issue of an increasing rate of drop @@@ -@@ @ outs ( 9.@@ 2 % in 1997 compared to 8.4 % in 1996 ) from vocational schools .
in comparison , drop @@@ -@@ @ out rates in general education are declining with approx .
2.7 % in 1996 and 2.5 % in 1997 .
Poland
in comparison , 2.7 % dropped out from general secondary education .
there has been an alarming increase in the number of early leav@@ ers from compulsory school , while specific measures to address the needs of this group are absent .
about 17 % of all youn@@ gsters do not complete compulsory education .
another 23 % have to be added to this figure , as there are children who never en@@ rol at school at all ( mainly coming from the Roma minority ) .
rates of drop @@@ -@@ @ outs from compulsory schools are higher in rural areas where families often live at subsistence level and children have to contribute to families ' income .
the situation has deteriorated in view of the severe economic crisis .
recent educational policies have placed higher emphasis on higher @@@ -@@ @ quality general education provision .
as a consequence , access to it has become more difficult for weaker students .
the rate of drop @@@ -@@ @ outs from the general education path at secondary level was 1.@@ 44 % in 1995 , while the one from the secondary technical / vocational education path was 4.@@ 84 % .
Slovak Republic
drop @@@ -@@ @ out rates in vocational education and training at the upper secondary level ( I@@ SC@@ ED 3 ) are relatively low ( an estimated 2.4 % in 1997 ) .
however , the 1998 Labour Force Survey reveals that 34 % of those registered as unemployed have no secondary @@@ -@@ @ level or appren@@ tic@@ eship qualification .
approx . 50 % of Slovakia 's Roma population are at school age .
more than 60 % of this group leave compulsory school pre@@ mat@@ urely .
these figures are also high in comparison with other Central and Eastern European countries .
in addition , rates for the latter are constantly declining . ( 6.0 % in 1996 ; 7.1 % in 1995 ) .
research is not carried out in this respect .
neither vocational counselling services by the National Employment Office nor special programmes address the needs of this group .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
low qualified teachers and trainers , as well as outdated curricula and equipment due to low investment in the sector reflected the poor social esteem of vocational education and training compared to academic education .
in the early 90 's further pressures for reform were added due to the fact that :
■ in @@@ -@@ @ company training facilities that had cat@@ ered for the practical part of training were closed down due to financial constraints of the companies undergoing restructuring ;
■ there was a huge demand for training / retraining in connection with the major economic and social restructuring processes .
moreover , the fact that in most countries there is still a strict separation of responsibilities for the sector has hampered the creation of a coherent conceptual and legal framework , as well as major structural reforms .
while ministries of education hold overall responsibility for initial ( school @@@ -@@ @ based ) education , including vocational education and training , several sector ministries are still responsible for schools operating in their sector .
in addition , ministries of labour that have often emerged from ministries formerly in charge of social affairs ( health and pension schemes , etc . ) have assumed responsibilities for training / retraining of the unemployed .
the exception here is Hungary .

however , the problem does not only lie with the acquisition of higher levels of formal qualifications but also with the need to improve the quality of training in general .

EU Ph@@ are support to vocational education and training reform 1990 @@@ -@@ @ 98
Romania received the biggest share amounting to € 28 million .
however , the number of schools and teachers who benefited from these programmes is relatively limited , in particular in bigger countries ( e.g. 35 vocational schools out of more than 1,000 in Poland ) 8 .
as mentioned before , initial activities concentrated on :
■ the establishment of partnerships with training institutions in European Union Member States ;
■ the drafting of policy papers on the main directions of vocational education and training reforms and the adoption , in most countries of the region , of new laws regulating specific aspects of the work of vocational education institutions .
in addition , a World Ban@@ k@@ project to reform the labour market training infrastructure has recently started in Romania .
vocational education and training reforms were started through a pilot school approach , empowering staff at a local level to develop new curricula and methodologies of work .
this approach reflects both the change of mentality and the democratic nature of reforms in Central and Eastern Europe .
it is sound in that reforms are ' owned ' by the very people who will have to deliver them .
schools acted mostly on their own to develop new vocational education models .
another weakness of the pilot school approach may be the fact that pilot schools are likely to become el@@ iti@@ st and isolated from mainstream education and training provision in the country .
in addition , most countries have yet to integrate their different reform initiatives into an overall education and training policy framework and find respective ' institutional homes ' for the roles and functions assigned to different players in the system .
new Ph@@ are funds to reform the vocational education and training system as such are hardly likely to become available .
however , training will remain an important element within sector @@@ -@@ @ related programmes .
in addition , the vocational training area may receive support through the ( co@@ - ) funding by Ph@@ are of European Social Fund type of actions after the year 2000 .
these measures will be helpful to strengthen the capacities of individual institutions or meet the training needs of specific target groups .
changes in vocational education and training legislation and policies
as regards the setting up of a legal framework in vocational education and training in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 / 90 , the following two phases can be identified :
in the first half of the 1990s , most countries prepared new legislation in the field of education including vocational education and training almost as a ' knee jer@@ k ' response to the beginning of the reform period in education .
they concentrated above all on the administrative framework underpinning the education and training system and on removing any ideological bias in education provision .
in many cases , the new legal provisions and single laws were adopted in a " vacuum , " without an overall policy reform plan ( governmental policy document or White papers on Voc@@ ational Education and Training ) in place .
in general , there was a tendency towards great detail in some areas ( educational levels , ideas of institutions ) and less in other areas ( accreditation , recognition ) .
the result of the first phase was a rather fragmented legal framework , reflecting the lack of a coherent approach towards vocational education and training as a system .
new laws regulating isolated aspects of the system co @@@ -@@ @ existed with old ones .
as a consequence , the new provisions in many countries were perceived as inadequate and had to undergo several amendments or re@@ placements .
second phase :
this is an ongoing process that requires , for some countries , the elaboration of completely new laws and for others the adaptation and amendment of the legislation already adopted during the first phase .
in this context , either the laws adapt to " de facto " practices or pave the way for future changes to the system .
it becomes clear from the latter that new laws can play a pivotal role in triggering off reform processes .
however , apart from new legislation , desired reforms also require subsequent guidance and support to the key change agents .
as mentioned earlier , the development of a comprehensive policy framework , setting out the broader vocational education and training reform strategy , is a prerequisite for elabor@@ ating a coherent legal basis for vocational education and training .
a vocational education and training law should be adopted afterwards or in parallel with the policy document , thus being instrumental in putting policies into practice .
in Central and Eastern Europe these two processes have not always followed a logical sequence .
Hungary and Slovenia should be mentioned as two exceptions here .
one other important feature to note are the parties involved in the process of elabor@@ ating vocational education and training policies and legislation .
most countries have realised the added value of involving key stakeholders in the various drafting phases , thus reaching a wider consensus from the outset of the process .
in addition , the exposure of draft laws to public debate and the support of national and international expertise has proved useful .

Bulgaria
a new Voc@@ ational Education and Training Act has passed several consultative committees and is expected to be adopted by the Parliament in April 1999 .
however , this new law follows the tradition of focusing on administrative details rather than key principles and mechanisms .
in the framework of the EU Ph@@ are 1994 VE@@ T Reform programme ( VE@@ TER@@ ST ) the Ministry of Education and Science has been working on a policy for a vocational education and training reform .
the process has been flawed by a lack of coherence between the policy plans and the underpinning legislation .
most conceptual work is done with foreign assistance and not necessarily based on the consideration as to whether or not the ministry would have the resources to implement the new policies .
there is no overall coherent continuing training policy which would also include the training of the employed .

transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
however , many of the aspirations expressed in this paper can be put into practice only in a longer @@@ -@@ @ term perspective .
a major breakthrough in vocational education and training reform was achieved by adopting the Laws on Higher Professional Education and Voc@@ ational Education Institutions in July 1998 .
by the year 2000 , the new law will bring all vocational schools under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education .
a new Law on Occu@@ p@@ ations is currently under preparation .
vocational education and training reforms in Hungary have been based on a sound ( and several times adjusted ) policy framework designed as early as the 80 's .
during the process of drafting this Law the German model in particular was examined .
since the adoption of this law several amendments have been made .
the continuing training sector is regulated by several laws and regulations , including the Voc@@ ational Training Act ( 1993 ) , the Employment Act ( 1991 ) and the Labour Code .
a new law on Voc@@ ational Education and Training is expected to be adopted in June 1999 .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
an overall training policy framework is still lacking .
however , qualification standards , teacher training , quality issues , vocational education and training research , counselling and guidance and private provision are not regulated .
the Ministry of Education and Science has developed a White Paper on vocational education and training which was presented to national authorities in March 1998 .
it addresses reform issues and measures up to the year 2005 .
a plan for funding , from the state budget , of actions between 1999 @@@ -@@ @ 2000 has also been defined .
continuing vocational education and training is regulated by the Law on Voc@@ ational Education and Training , the Law on Non @@@ -@@ @ For@@ mal Ad@@ ult Education ( June 1998 ) and the Law on Support of the Un@@ employed ( February 1996 ) .
training beyond compulsory level focuses mainly on training of the unemployed , while in @@@ -@@ @ company training schemes or ( re@@ - ) training to prevent unemployment have been rather marginal .
in 1997 only 6.7 % of those registered as unemployed took part in training .
Poland
the numerous reform ideas originating from a number of very active vocational education and training institutions have often not met with sufficient support from the national / policy level .
since 1997 the Ministry of National Education has conducted a vigorous review of its policy , resulting in the adoption of a new Law on Education in July 1998 .
the 1997 Law on Scho@@ ols of Higher Professional Education requires institutions to include social partner representatives in their governing boards .
people working in industry but with a doc@@ torate level qualification can take up teaching assignments .
according to the new law , the Ministry of National Education will take over responsibility for all schools formerly run by sector ministries .
compulsory education will be extended to 16 year olds and career paths at the secondary level will basically be divided into two streams .
the 3 @@@ -@@ @ year " pro@@ filed Ly@@ ce@@ a " stream providing education and training for 14 broader profiles .
continuing vocational education and training is based on the 1991 Law on the Education System which outlines the tasks , structure and forms of education of employed adults .
the sector is regulated by separate decrees of both the Ministry of National Education and Ministry of Labour and Social Policy which do not suggest a coherent policy framework .
( Re@@ - ) training of the unemployed is regulated by the Law on Employment and Coun@@ ter@@ acting Un@@ employment adopted in 1996 .
coordination between the Ministries of Education and Labour on training policies and activities has been virtually non @@@ -@@ @ exist@@ ant .
this would have enabled a more efficient use of World Bank and EU Ph@@ are funds .
in this context , an adult training infrastructure separate from the initial training structure was planned in Romania where a maxim@@ isation of scarce resources is essential .
vocational education and training is regulated as part of the general Law on Education .
a new amendment to the Law on Education is currently being debated by the Parliament .
it fores@@ ees the extension of compulsory schooling to 9 years with a subsequent reduction of one year in the vocational education and training cycle .
this change may further aggravate the quality of vocational education and training and reduce overall attainment levels of young people op@@ ting for the vocational education and training career path .
with the Law 1 / 1991 on Social Welfare and Voc@@ ational R@@ e @@@ -@@ @ integration , the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection has become responsible for the training of the unemployed which is paid out of the Un@@ employment Fund .
Slovak Republic
political support and an integrated strategy for vocational education and training reform have been lacking .
however , there are indications that Open@@ ness ' and commitment to reform will improve under the new government .
apart from some minor amendments , the legal framework remained largely unchanged and inadequate to meet the new challenges .
a new Education Act was prepared during 1996 / 97 but was not passed by the Parliament .
there continues to be no legal basis for Post@@ secondary non@@ university vocational education .
the 1996 Act on Employment represents an up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date legal framework that sets out the main guidelines for employment and labour market policies in the Slovak Republic .
however , financial resources to implement respective measures are severely limited .
the further education / continuing vocational training area is regulated by an Act passed by the Ministry of Education in December 1997 .
a modern education and training policy framework provides for the alignment , in a mid@@ term perspective , of vocational education and training in Slovenia with mainstream developments in Europe .
the framework also provides for training provision within a dual system but scales have so far remained marginal .
the 1996 overhaul of legislation provides a good framework for an integrated training system adap@@ table to a changing economy .
a range of legislation is in place regulating initial vocational education , assuring coherence in policy and institutional terms with continuing training planning and programmes .
comprehensive legislation is in place assuring planning and access to continuing education and training ( Ad@@ ult Education Act 1996 , Fin@@ ancing of Education Act , 1996 ) .
the Employment and Un@@ employment Insurance Act ( 1990 ) with amendments ( 1998 ) provides for training / retraining for specific groups , e.g. long @@@ -@@ @ term unemployed , reflecting EU employment policy areas .
in 1997 , 55 % of the registered unemployed participated in training measures .
regional variations in unemployment need to be strategically addressed as structural unemployment takes hold .
for instance , the Go@@ ren@@ j@@ ska and Kar@@ st regions have a growing population of unemployed older workers ( above 40 years of age ) .
finally , general collective agreements for the commercial and non @@@ -@@ @ commercial sectors bind the employer and employee to provide or follow training , respectively .
following the dé@@ mo@@ cr@@ atisation of the society , most governmental authorities advocated at the start of reforms , a decentr@@ alisation of power to regional , local and institutional levels .
although the decentr@@ alisation of power differs considerably from country to country , the following tendencies can be described :
'@@ Control ' should shift towards an evaluation of the ' process ' , i.e. teaching effectiveness , and Out@@ comes ' ( the assessment , by independent bodies , of students ' competencies ) .
funding of vocational education and training has seen a diversification of sources , although the lion 's share is still provided by the state budget .
the costs of practical training and facilities , which used to be met by enterprises , are now mainly covered by the state .
in most countries , state funds for initial vocational education and training are provided by the ministries of education and sector ministries involved and those for training / retraining of unemployed adults by the ministries of labour .
expenditure has , on the whole , not kept pace with soaring inflation .
budget cuts pose serious threats not only to plans for modernisation , but in some countries , such as Bulgaria and Romania , also to the ability of meeting running costs for existing vocational education and training provision .
labour minist@@ ri@@ es@@ v@@ budgets are hardly sufficient to administer unemployment and pay adequate benefits to an increasing number of persons .
with the exception of countries , such as Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary or Slovenia , active labour market training schemes are largely underdeveloped also due to a lack of necessary funding .
some countries , such as Estonia , have changed from a funding control based on strict normative input criteria , to lump sum funding arrangements .
this implies that a certain amount per student and year would be made available from the state budget .
financial management would then be at the discretion of the school management .
school budgets are expected to allow for enough flexibility so as to encourage both development projects at schools and good performance of teachers .
another trend is the increasing share of private ventures in the training market , although scales are still limited and their engagement remains ' niche ' -@@ oriented .
as previously mentioned , generally resources in Central and Eastern Europe are limited and the vocational education and training sector , where unit costs are higher in comparison with general education , is under @@@ -@@ @ funded .
however , it may be argued that existing funds are not always used in an efficient way .
for example , the stream@@ lining of the school infrastructure or the increase of the number of student / teacher ratio represent potential areas for further ration@@ alisation .
furthermore , in the absence of an overall human resource planning system , it is very difficult to assess which training capacities might be needed in the future and which not .
the private sector and businesses as a whole are increasingly expected to contribute in various forms to initial and continuing vocational training .

table 3 Country examples : financing of vocational education and training
Bulgaria
vocational schools are financed from the state budget .
in 1996 , the total state budget for education was 2.8 % and for vocational education and training 0.@@ 35 % , as a percentage of GDP .
the relative expenditure on education is very low .
most Central and Eastern European countries have a total expenditure on education of between 5 to 6 % of their G@@ D@@ Ps .
the schools may generate their own income to supplement the central budget allocation .
activities of the National Employment Service are funded through the Voc@@ ational Qualification and Un@@ employment Fund to which employers pay direct contributions as a percentage of their total wage bills .
however , only 0.3 % of this fund is ear@@ marked for training .
the skills upgrading of employed people is largely the responsibility of the employers and individuals themselves . %
this is done on a per capita basis . in 1997 the total public expenditure on education was 4.7 % of GDP , while 0.@@ 89 % was ear@@ marked for vocational education and training .
other continuing education training courses ( full @@@ -@@ @ time or part @@@ -@@ @ time ) provided at state secondary vocational schools and universities are funded by the Ministry of Education .
courses organised by private schools have to be paid by the participants themselves , although they may be co @@@ -@@ @ financed by the state budget .
as for public expenditure on all education as a percentage of GDP , Estonia ( 6.@@ 95 % in 1996 ) ranks highest in Central and Eastern Europe .
however , the actual share ear@@ marked for vocational education and training ( 0.@@ 64 % ) is relatively low and limits Estonia 's capacity for reform .
the use of these funds would be largely at the discretion of school management - a system designed to encourage innovation .
registered unemployed ( approx .
42 % of unemployed people not registered ) are entitled to receive either training free of charge for up to six months or a respective allowance .
so far training has been mainly contracted out to non @@@ -@@ @ public institutions .
except for a few bigger companies , rates of investment in human resource development have remained low .
continuing training is exclusively financed by those interested in it .
financing is regulated under the 1995 Labour Market Fund Act .
5.@@ 87 % of GDP was allocated to education with 0.@@ 77 % ear@@ marked for vocational education and training ( 1996 ) which is slightly higher than average in Central and Eastern Europe ( 0.@@ 59 % ) .
vocational schools are financed from the state budget .
school maintenance and teachers ' salary costs account for 97 % of the budget , while the remaining 3 % is for innovation .
a reform of the financing formula and mechanisms is currently being debated .
funding provided for labour market training amounts to approx .
employers investment into staff training has more than doubled in comparison with the periods 1995 and 1997 .
initial vocational education and training is mainly funded from state and municipal budgets .
public expenditure on education accounted for 5.8 % in 1997 ( 5.5 % in 1996 ) of GDP , which is low but in line with other Central and Eastern European countries .
vocational education and training expenditure represents only 0.4 % of GDP or 1.9 % of the total state budget .
a debate on the establishment of a Voc@@ ational Training Fund to which employers are supposed to contribute is on going .
training programmes for redundant workers and the unemployed are financed from the Employment Fund which consists of employers ' and employees ' compulsory unemployment insurance contributions , subsidies from the state budget and other sources .
although the Fund seems to be functioning well , funds are insufficient and the effectiveness of their use is still to be formally assessed .
the state provides grants and other support measures for programmes , enti@@ tlement to paid training leave in the private sector , research and training for disadvantaged groups .
however , the impact of these state incentives has so far remained rather low .
in 1997 , about 8 % of courses were financed by private employers .
it is intended that the state and municipalities provide some funding for non @@@ -@@ @ formal training from 1999 onwards .
Poland
compulsory education , including initial vocational education and training is primarily paid from the state budget .
public expenditure on vocational education and training as a percentage of GDP was 0.7 % in 1997 while public expenditure on education was 5.6 % .
it is hoped that this will enhance overall local responsibility and take better account of local needs .
continuing vocational education and training is mainly financed from three sources : ( a ) public funds , ( b ) employers and ( c ) students themselves .
minor contributions come from foundations , non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations and foreign assistance .
tax incentives are granted to both employers and individuals for training purposes .
compared to 1997 , this represented a reduction of the state expenditure on education by 2.9 % .
Slovak Republic
costs for education and training are largely covered by the state .
total expenditure on education amounts to 4.7 % of GDP , while the share ear@@ marked for vocational education and training is 0.9 % of GDP .
employers and employees alike contribute , through their unemployment insurance , to the Un@@ employment Fund .
registered unemployed are entitled to receive training .
however , a major part of the total National Labour Office budget for 1997 was spent on passive measures ( approx .
56 % ) , while only approx . 11 % were used for the ( re@@ - ) training of the unemployed .
in 1996 public funds spent on vocational education and training accounted for 0.@@ 64 % of the GDP .
the success of the dual system will be determined by employers ' contributions ( appren@@ tic@@ eship income / social insurance , planning , placements , etc . ) .
Trans@@ ì@@ ì@@ ational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
involvement of social partners
in the European Union social dialogue ( even in the field of vocational training ) , is a consolidated but diversified reality and recognised as being at the heart of the European Union 's social legislation .
the departure point of social partnership in Central and Eastern Europe was radically different , as the concept was completely unknown before reforms started .
the concept of social partnership in Central and East Europe has emerged in a particular context : the move towards a more diversified social structure resulted in the proliferation of interest groups .
employer organisations did not exist under the old " regime " and therefore had to be developed from the scratch .
the previously existing trade unions suffered from a major loss of their legitimacy and a drastic decrease in membership , which forced them to radically re @@@ -@@ @ orient themselves towards new functions .
in most countries new independent trade unions emerged but were often in competition with the existing ones which has further hampered the increase of their impact .
finally , the economic environment , which was marked by a rapid structural transformation and accompanied by a serious economic decline and increased unemployment , has been an additional obstacle .
while the situation seems to be evolving in a positive direction , social partner participation in vocational education and training in Central and Eastern Europe is a diversified but still rather limited phenomenon .
it reflects the different socio @@@ -@@ @ economic , political and cultural backgrounds and traditions of the country concerned .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
Bulgaria
the system is still managed in a highly centr@@ alised way .
at national level there has been limited involvement of social par@@ ta@@ ers whose main interests concentrate on negotiations relating to salaries and working conditions of employees .
there is presently no institutional framework in place to allow for the structured involvement of social partners .
social dialogue on economic and social issues takes place at a national level in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement .
however , there is no national institutional framework for social partner involvement in training issues .
their influence on policy or decision @@@ -@@ @ making issues in the area of training is extremely limited .
although the management of the system is still largely centr@@ alised , more tasks are being delegated to lower hierarchical levels and social partners .
these operate under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
at local level social partners are encouraged by law to participated on tri@@ partite school boards .
Hungary has been quicker than other Central and Eastern European countries in providing for a social dialogue on vocational education and training issues at both national lev@@ el@@ through the National Voc@@ ational Training Council - and local levels - through the county councils .
the tri@@ partite National Voc@@ ational Training Council advises the government on all strategic issues related to vocational education and training .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
a social dialogue culture in decision @@@ -@@ @ making processes has been largely absent , although social partner organisations are increasingly consulted on policy issues .
a tri@@ partite Co @@@ -@@ @ operation Council on Voc@@ ational Education and Training has been established .
however , overall , the role that social partners play in vocational education and training has not yet been clearly defined , although there has been agreement on the setting up of tri@@ partite branch committees for carrying out labour market needs analyses and defining occupational standards .
a mixed vocational education and training management system is being encouraged , with greater involvement of the private sector .
although a legal framework has been created for social partnership at all levels , social dialogue still needs to be put into effect .
further decentr@@ alisation of decision making and management processes is envisaged along the lines of the regional administration reform ongoing in Poland .
a legal framework for social dialogue exists .
social partners have been consulted on various policy issues through their participation in different tri@@ partite bodies at national and regional levels but their opinion has not always been taken into consideration in decisions taken by the ministries .
overall however , social partners have taken a rather passive role and not shown a great deal of interest in training issues .
there has been a limited involvement of social partners in training issues to date .
however , a new institutional framework for social partner participation in continuing training has recently been adopted .
some co @@@ -@@ @ operation has been ( re@@ - ) established between individual schools and local employers .
a National Agency for Employment and Training became operational in January 1999 .
the Agency 's main objectives include the institution@@ alisation of a social dialogue on employment and training issues , as well as the effective management of related measures .
Slovak Republic
social partners were , for instance , not involved in the design of new curricula .
however , since the formation of the new government in 1998 , there are positive indications for the development of a social dialogue at national level .
the government has announced its intention to put social dialogue on a legislative basis .
the institutional involvement of employers to vocational education and training developments is well established in law but direct practical involvement in local planning and delivery is weak .
the contribution of trade unions at all levels is negligible .
support is required to ensure the effective contribution of social partners at branch , regional / local and school levels .
there is a pilot dual system in place but its future , as mentioned before , is at risk , the employers ' ultimate commitment is not certain .
staff training levels in enterprises and organisational support have so far remained low .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
although the labour market is only one factor amongst many others that influence the functions , scope and content of vocational education and training , it is its most important reference point .
such surveys can give an early warning as to possible sectoral recessions or booms , globalisation trends , etc .
while long @@@ -@@ @ term forecasts are mostly done on an aggregate basis , short @@@ -@@ @ term forecasts typically provide greater detail and are more reliable particularly in countries with economies in a state of flux .
in the Central and Eastern Europe the traditional methods , concepts and parameters of labour market needs analyses have been under scrutiny in order to see whether and how they are able to reflect changes taking place in the labour market .
Mu@@ ch@@ of@@ the information in this sec@@ tion@@ was taken from ' Lin@@ king Labour Market Analysis and Voc@@ ational Training '@@ published by the European Training Foundation in 1998 .
several problems and challenges arose in this context :
the large @@@ -@@ @ scale economic restructuring processes linked to the transition towards a market economy created a great deal of instability and uncertainty as to labour market developments .
as a result , there are major information gaps regarding skills and training requirements within the labour market .
specific types of data are either not collected at all or are not provided in a format that would allow education planners to respond . in general , there is a lack of targeted information , e.g. :
lack of analytical capacity
even where this general labour market information is available , it may not be sufficiently analysed for vocational education and training purposes .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
deficiencies in the support framework
with the exception of very few countries , there is a lack of co @@@ -@@ @ operation between the different actors who could play a major role in ensuring the link between vocational education and training and the labour market .
before the reform process started , the curriculum concept in Central and Eastern Europe was based on a centrally planned economy , with relatively static employment patterns .
the curriculum ( including teaching programmes for various subjects ) was perceived as a document containing a technical content that had to be ' transmitted ' to the students .
in fact this became one of the first objectives of their curricul@@ ar reforms .
later , in the 1980s , the concept of ' core compet@@ ences ' , such as the ability to communicate , to work in teams and to learn independently , was promoted .
individual schools have had to respond on their own simply in order to survive .
in general , such schools , in the absence of signals from enterprises , have largely relied on the educational aspirations of students .
schools have not been able to rely on external professional support institutions a great deal .
only recently , a number of Central and Eastern European countries have begun to establish the national institutions and mechanisms that would enable them to leave continuous innovation to schools .
this work , however , appears to be extremely complex .
additional pressure arises from the need to provide for a transparency of qualifications with those acquired in other countries , particularly the EU Member States .
curricul@@ ar reforms in Central and Eastern Europe countries have adopted a wide spectrum of possible approaches to the organisation of the curriculum .
they followed either a course @@@ -@@ @ based , subject @@@ -@@ @ based or modular pattern or a mixture of those .
it is not clear why this approach has been advocated ( or not ) in general or by specific advisers in particular .

vocational school teachers in all Central and Eastern European countries basically lacked process knowledge .
institutes for initial teacher and further teacher training exist in all Central and Eastern European countries .
however , there are only few countries which have specific institutions that provide training for vocational school teachers and trainers .

transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
although pilot school teachers who are to introduce the new curricula have carried out comprehensive fra@@ ining programmes , national @@@ -@@ @ wide teacher fra@@ ining programmes have not been launched .
emphasis should be put on introducing the new curriculum principles to preserv@@ ice as well as in @@@ -@@ @ service vocational teachers .
in this context , they would require a careful ' coaching ' by experienced teachers .
changing the climate of an institution and the attitudes of staff requires resources and time .
it requires a long @@@ -@@ @ term commitment at national level with clear policy objectives .
experience gained in other countries shows that the development of both new types of learning organisation and new types of management skills normally requires a timeframe of at least a decade .
perhaps the most important reform issue in teacher training is the training of the trainers themselves .
substantial investment has to be made in this field before the reform process can develop its full pot@@ enti@@ al@@ .@@ 12

the options chosen , at the first glance , appear as a bewil@@ dering variety .
however , in Western Europe the variety of models is by no means smaller .
despite this diversity some common features can be identified which have emerged in the field of Post@@ secondary vocational / tertiary professional education in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s :
however , a few Central and Eastern European universities are , from a legal point of view , not allowed to offer under@@ graduate education .
this is coupled with a considerable degree of resistance from the universities themselves to what they consider a competing sector .
efforts have been taken to agree different educational attainment levels at national level .
in some cases there appear to be no clear demarc@@ ation lines between secondary vocational education and Post@@ secondary vocational education .
parallel structures may exist : Post@@ secondary programmes requiring up to two years of additional studies upon completion of secondary education are intertwined with vocational education programmes at secondary level which last 45 years .
in most of these cases , structures were retained from the past .
institutions were rarely established from scratch .
there are many institutions providing programmes exclusively in the field of Post@@ secondary vocational / tertiary professional education .
institutions who wanted to offer programmes leading to this attainment level had to apply to their ministries for a special ' college ' or ' higher education establishment ' status .
programmes were upgraded mainly at the initiative of the institution that applied for the higher status .
as access to university education was formerly restricted , the emergence of this new sector represented good compensation .
participation rates in the area of Post@@ secondary vocational / tertiary professional education have been constantly increasing since their establishment .
there is a considerable degree of confusion and uncertainty as to the meaning of the concept of continuing training .
this may well reflect the actual situation in the countries themselves .
here it is simply defined as " all learning that improves the employ@@ ability of adults who have left the compulsory education system . "
the former continuing education and training systems have collapsed .
the old concepts , designed for completely different political , economic and social contexts , are no longer suitable for today 's needs .
however , despite the crucial role and contribution that continuing education and training can and should play during the transition process , it has not received priority attention to date .
continuing education and training is carried out in a fragmented rather than systematic way .
with the withdrawal of state and enterprises , the employment services have been left to take charge of ( parts of ) continuing education and training .
the institutional continuing education and training infrastructure is insufficient , leaving many potential target groups with no access to any type of continuing education and training .
new concepts , structures , programmes and approaches have to be developed to meet the new labour market and social requirements .
all major stakeholders should be involved in such a process .
governments in particular could initiate the debate by preparing Green ( consultation ) papers .
the most critical issue facing continuing education and training appears to be funding .
employers should be encouraged to invest in human resource development and make use of matching funds or other incentives .
the role of the state and social partners goes beyond funding .
in addition or as a substitute , a national system of qualification standards and their independent assessment would have to be developed .
most enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe , particularly the larger ones , have invested in training to some extent .
respective means for small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises are much more limited , if not completely non @@@ -@@ @ existent .
the majority of SM@@ E managers may be technically qualified , as engineers or scientists , for example , but are running businesses largely without having benefited from any management training .
recent surveys revealed that there is a lack of integrated management training courses aiming at the development of comprehensive managerial knowledge and skills for business managers .
governments have to respond with special support measures for companies , in particular SMEs , which include training specifically tailored to their needs .
in addition , the specific needs of adult lear@@ ners mean that more attention should be paid to the availability and quality of learning opportunities , flexible training delivery , specific training methodologies , and the integration of work and learning .
assessment and certification would need to be developed , taking into account the fact that learning can also take place outside the formal system@@ .@@ 13

challenges for training in the transition context
following on from the initiated reforms , the Central and East European countries are facing the following challenges which will have a major impact on their vocational education and training systems :
well @@@ -@@ @ structured institutional arrangements have to be put in place to anticipate shifts in employment and vocational qualifications .
coordination mechanisms have to be set up to ensure the use of forecasts in initial and continuing vocational training , vocational guidance and the work of employment agencies .
in addition , capacities of individual companies need to be strengthened to identify their own skill requirements and training needs .
■ a credible research base helping vocational education and training institutions respond to changes in the structure of jobs and skills , and , last but not least ,
to integrate and operate new organisational structures , managers need to be trained to :
■ adjusting the existing school infrastructure and programmes to the new economic priorities ;
■ increasing investment in vocational education and training to promote innovation and ensure higher levels of both participation and attainment in vocational education and training ;

table 6 Country examples : groups at risk of social exclusion
Bulgaria
special programmes to combat social exclusion are limited but exist for groups of people with disabilities and ethnic minorities .
amongst the latter group of people , approx .
special measures include counselling services , training and social re ­ integration courses , assistance for job ­ seekers and support to Rom@@ any entrepreneurs .
Russians represent 2@@ 8.7 % of the total population .
recent changes to the citizenship law make natur@@ alisation easier for the children of non ­ citizen 's .
Russian schools co ­ exist with Estonian ones at elementary level , while the choice for non ­ Estonian speakers at both secondary and tertiary levels is limited .
on ­ going Estonian language training and other support measures seek to better integrate ethnic minorities into the society .
although there are no legal restrictions as to the access to training , respective facilities are un@@ evenly spread over the country .
according to the 1997 Labour Force Survey , the employment rate of women fell from 57 % in 1992 to 42 % .
according to the Labour Force Survey 2nd quarter 1998 , 40 % of the registered unemployed have not acquired any labour market qualifications ( primary school leav@@ ers ) .
although some training programmes are run by the Ministry of Social Affairs for people at risk of social exclusion , demand exceeds supply by far and geographical areas are not evenly covered .
some training for disadvantaged groups is provided through cler@@ ical or other institutions but support by the state to such initiatives is limited .
in October 1998 a law was passed that calls for state and municipal schools to introduce Latvian as the obligatory instruc@@ tional language by the year 2004 , which has created social tensions .
the Re@@ hab@@ ilitation Centre in Jur@@ mal@@ a is the only institution providing vocational education and training courses for young people with physical disabilities .
transnational analysis of vocational education and training in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
the Law on Education guarantees provision of education to ethnic minorities , of mainly Russian ( 8.2 % ) and Polish origin ( 6.@@ 9 % ) , in their mother tongue .
9 % of students in vocational education and training schools were trained in their mother tongue ( 1997 / 98 ) .
in March 1999 a new law will come into effect that provides for equal opportunities of men and women .
however , women are more vulnerable to become unemployed than men .
female unemployment tot@@ alled 5@@ 4.5 % of all unemployed in 1998 .
great differences between urban and rural areas exist as regards access to training .
programmes have been established for vocational rehabilitation and employment of the disabled , following the adoption of the Law on Social Integration of the Disabled .
however , there is lack of specialised teachers and teaching equipment .
Poland
according to the Polish law , men and women have equal opportunities in education .
although women normally reach higher levels of education , their labour market prospects are slightly lower than those of men .
groups at risk of social exclusion include the low qualified , long @@@ -@@ @ term unemployed , people living on social benefits or pensions and people in rural areas .
attempts are being made to address the needs of the long @@@ -@@ @ term unemployed including the establishment of Job Clubs and providing job application and life skills training .
vocational education for disabled persons is still far from meeting the real needs and the international standards as accepted by the UN in 1993 .
in 1993 the share of women in the Romanian labour force was close to 50 % , in contrast with 25 % in European OECD countries .
however , the trend of female participation in the labour market is decreasing , as women are more vulnerable to unemployment than men .
in 1996 the unemployment rate was slightly higher for women ( 7.3 % ) than for men ( 6.3 % ) .
amongst the unemployed trained in 1997 by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection , 60 % were girls below 25 years of age .
in 1994 @@@ -@@ @ 95 the Roma population represented 9.@@ 4 % of the Romanian population .
adult illiteracy among this group is estimated to amount to over 50 % and in some communities even 80 % .
there are no specific training measures for groups at risk of social exclusion .
Slovak Republic
traditionally , there is a high female employment rate ( 47 % ) by EU standards .
however , as women are more vulnerable to losing their jobs than men , the number of unemployed women is rising .
women accounted for 7@@ 2.8 % of the total number of re@@ trained unemployed in 1997 .
the structure of participation in vocational education is gender @@@ -@@ @ biased , where the choice of voc@@ ations , particularly in the dual system , is traditionally male .
while the total unemployment rate in Slovenia amounts to some 7 % ( in 1996 ) , approx .
19 % of young people 24 years of age or younger are unemployed .
no specific measures exist for training and employment preparation of people with special needs .
shel@@ tered workshops are the main employment opportunity for the handicapped but are city @@@ -@@ @ based restricting access to rural residents .
there are no specific measures to encourage employers to adapt workplaces for people with special needs .

" training can no longer be reserved just for the young .
we must equip and train the whole of the potential workforce . " 15@@ This statement holds especially true for the transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe .
modernisation can be started through experiments and learning processes for all those participating .

the aim is to help universities to adapt efficiently to a changing internal and external environment .
University management comprises strategic management and day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day administration .
projects must aim at the implementation of a coherent reform strategy in specific aspects of university management , which the beneficiary university has identified as a need .
projects must allow the target group to carry out a range of measures for the implementation of reform concepts and support the development of specific skills related to the identified area .
the project must be based on a consensus in the beneficiary university and thus ensure that a dynamic process is put in motion .
curriculum development , and academic staff retraining activities linked to anything other than administrative and management skills , C@@ AN@@ NOT be addressed by University Management J@@ E@@ Ps .
if a project targets cooperation with industry or external bodies these must be included in the project consortium ( e.g. chambers of commerce , enterprises , local authorities etc . ) .
the relevant endorsement letters will be expected with the application .
improvement of universities ' international relations and contact building : this may include in particular the establishment or modernisation of international relations offices .
setting up new structures to develop and strengthen links between universities and other social and economic players in the partner countries with the view to strengthening the role of universities in their environment and their capacity to adapt to changing needs .
target group of University
the main actors of a University Management J@@ EP are administrators and managers .
these can be any members of the university administrative services , e.g. financial administration , student services , library etc .
the target group of a University Management J@@ EP must be well defined and is expected to include all those persons relevant to the reform process envisaged by the project .
below is a list of examples of outcomes and activities that could be undertaken in order to reach the objective of a University Management project which aims to modern@@ ise a University 's International Relations Office .
project objective
curriculum Development Joint European Projects should focus on the content and quality of higher education in the relevant national priority areas .
curriculum and course development can be undertaken at graduate or post ­ graduate level , and could also include the introduction of short ­ cycle , practically oriented higher education courses .
examples of activities to be undertaken include :
♦ development of new curricula and courses ;
♦ adaptation or up ­ dating of existing curricula and courses ;
♦ development of new teaching materials / adaptation of existing teaching materials ;
♦ adoption of new / restructured teaching methodologies ;
♦ introduction of multi ­ level education systems ( short cycle Bac@@ helor degree courses / Master degree courses ) ;
♦ dissemination of results ;
below is a list of examples of outcomes and activities that could be realised in order to reach the objective of a Cur@@ ricul@@ um Development project .
recognised new curriculum implemented curriculum development actions including the review , adaptation , restructuring of existing and / or creation of new courses ;
D actions to support the approval procedure of a new curriculum by relevant educational authorities , e.g. the sen@@ ate of the university .
N@@ eil ' te@@ ac@@ li@@ ing materials introduced development or adaptation of related teaching material ( including , for the latter , translation , printing and dissemination ) .
institution Building Joint European Projects
project objective
T@@ emp@@ us Institution Building J@@ E@@ Ps focus on the development of the administrative and institutional structures of partner countries , in particular with a view to promoting democracy and the rule of law .
these projects therefore target public and private institutions outside the academic sector , including those more directly linked to the development of civil society .
the framework of reference for these projects are
• the Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements ( P@@ CA@@ s ) signed by the NIS and the EU and
• the priorities governing cooperation between the EU and the non associated countries in South East Europe .
each project should aim at developing and delivering short ­ cycle ( 1 ­ 6 months ) training or retraining courses for national administrators , professional associations , the semi public sector and local / regional administrators .
these will focus on practical knowledge and skills directly related to the development of the administrative and institutional structures of the partner country .
the courses are organised by a partner country university .
within the T@@ emp@@ us Institution Building project , this university will perform the following tasks :
♦ coordinate the training course programme
♦ li@@ aise with the target institution with a view to identifying the training needs and recruiting the people to be trained
♦ organise the training course modules within the period of funding of the J@@ EP
♦ organise the mobility of trainers / train@@ ees within the consortium .
the training courses should meet the following requirements :
♦ a sound balance between the size of the beneficiary group and the funding received
♦ focus on the development of skills rather than academic knowledge .
updated equipment acquiring of information materials , books , electronic media hardware and software .
D selection of train@@ ees ( target public ) ; language preparation of train@@ ees , if relevant ;
D evaluation of the training program@@ me@@ . contact and information to wider target group ; dissemination seminar ; creation of Web pages .
active project management team regular meetings of representatives of the partners in the consortium , including the target public for monitoring progress .
mobility Joint European Projects
project objective
a Mob@@ ility Joint European Project should focus on the structured implementation of student mobility by a network of universities , institutions , industries and companies and should create long term cooperation between the partners involved in student exchange .
projects must incorporate recognition of any study period spent abroad through the introduction of academic recognition mechanisms ( e.g. EC@@ TS ) .
particular importance should be attached to the availability of a tutor / supervisor for all mobility students and full access to facilities / services at the host university / institution / industry or company .
as the aim of the Mob@@ ility Joint European Project is the creation of a network , in addition to the minimum requirements of a consortium , the involvement of further partner country and EU consortium members is expected .
please see Annex 3 ­ Pri@@ orities for the partner countries ) .
projects may undertake the following tasks :
♦ mobility of staff for coordination purposes and for discussion on student mobility related issues such as preparation of study periods , credit transfer , course and recognition of diplomas etc . ;
♦ short targeted intensive courses for students from the partner countries ;
♦ development of supervisory mechanisms ( a tutor should be available for the supervision of all mobility students ) ;
♦ development of student services and international offices ( assistance in accommodation , visas , health insurance , access to university facilities , etc . ) ;
♦ limited administrative tasks which are directly linked to the establishment and coordination of the mobility network ;
♦ limited purchase of communication equipment essential for the implementation of the project activities ;
♦ provision of necessary teaching material e.g. books .
networking Projects ( NP )
project objective
T@@ emp@@ us Networking Projects should contribute to the following objectives :
♦ dissemination of best practice and outcomes focusing particularly on T@@ emp@@ us projects ;
♦ setting up of national and international networks of universities
♦ strengthening of regional cooperation
♦ promotion of higher education reform in the subject area .
networks can be based on the following models :
national network involving universities and other consortium members from one single partner country and the European Union
regional network involving universities and other consortium members from two or several partner countries and the European Union .
in addition to the project requirements for a profile of a partnership a network must comprise a minimum number of five universities or eligible institutions , industries or companies in the participating partner countries .
at least two of these must have been or must be currently involved in a T@@ emp@@ us Joint European project .
it is strongly suggested that networks aim at increasing the number of consortium members participating in the network over the period of funding .
T@@ emp@@ us networks may also be associated with activities developed by relevant thematic Er@@ as@@ mus networks funded by the European programme for cooperation in education , S@@ ocr@@ ates .
this should provide for cooperation with universities in the European Union and in candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe that are now eligible for participation in Er@@ as@@ mus .
♦ identification of needs ( demand ) and availability of existing outputs in priority areas ( supply ) ;
♦ identification of specific target public for existing outputs ;
♦ external quality assessment of existing outputs and selection of best outputs for dissemination ;
♦ quality improvements of selected outputs ( if needed ) and adaptation to needs of the identified target public ;
♦ evaluation of project outcomes
♦ dissemination of project outcomes and best practice in project management
♦ recognition of courses by national authorities .
examples of activities falling under these areas :
♦ evaluation of existing project outputs , in particular by using peer review techniques ;
♦ improvement of existing outputs and / or adaptation of existing project outputs to a wider target audience ;
♦ contribution to the dissemination of best outputs ;
♦ li@@ a@@ ising with national authorities , in order to promote recognition of new courses ;
♦ li@@ a@@ ising with projects working in relevant areas and funded either by the Ph@@ are and T@@ ac@@ is programmes or by the Ph@@ are and T@@ ac@@ is successor programmes ;
♦ participation in T@@ emp@@ us information activities , thereby acting as a facilitator for the transfer of know ­ how to a new generation of T@@ emp@@ us projects ;
♦ limited purchase of communication equipment essential for the implementation of the project activities .
it is of the utmost importance that the network dissemination activities focus on selected best outputs rather than on large ­ scale dissemination of all the outputs .
to this end , all the outputs should be submitted to evaluation within the network and only the best outputs should be disseminated .
the importance of carrying out peer reviews should be emphasi@@ sed within the project network , as this will facilitate dissemination .
experts from candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe
it is strongly suggested that each network , if need be with the support of respective tips / NT@@ Os , identifies appropriate experts from candidate countries from Central and Eastern European countries who will actively participate in the networking activities .
such experts can be higher education representatives and Institution Building specialists with prior involvement in T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are projects and possibly with experience in the development of the specific output to be disseminated .
their participation may be financed from the T@@ emp@@ us grant on the invitation of one of the consortium members and if justified in the original application and accompanied by curriculum vit@@ ae .
these links should in particular facilitate large ­ scale dissemination of outputs .
individuals from partner countries
in this way additional partner organisations or individuals using Individual Mob@@ ility Gran@@ ts could become involved in the network .
below is a list of examples of outputs and activities that could be realised in order to reach the objective of a Networking Project .
( limited ) purchase of equipment to speed up and facilitate communication between associate members ( if needed ) .
establish an inventory of curricula and teaching material developed by previous T@@ emp@@ us projects in the subject area of the network ;
♦ other higher education institutions may be considered eligible only if this is indicated in the respective country ­ specific priorities , which are listed in Annex 3 ­ Pri@@ orities for the partner countries ;
♦ industries and companies as defined in the glos@@ sary ;
♦ institutions as defined in the glos@@ sary .
from the European
Union
♦ all universities as defined in the glos@@ sary and recognised by the national authorities ;
♦ industries and companies as defined in the glos@@ sary ;
♦ institutions as defined in the glos@@ sary .
the participation of such experts may be financed from the T@@ emp@@ us grant on the invitation of one of the consortium members .
their involvement should be justified in the original application and accompanied by a curriculum vit@@ ae .
! that higher education institutions that are mainly research ­ ' orient@@ ed@@ are@@ not eligible to be consortium members .
project requirements
T@@ emp@@ us projects are run by con@@ sor@@ tia of universities , institutions , industries and companies .
it is important to bear in mind that they aim at sustainable results and impact at an institutional level .
for this reason the goals of the project should always be viewed in the context of the wider environment , and every attempt should be made to cooperate with relevant individuals outside the consortium in order to achieve sustainable results .
a project consortium must include at least :
♦ one university from each partner country involved in the project ;
♦ one university in one EU Member State , and one consortium member ( university , institution or industry / company ) in a different Member State ;
♦ for Networking projects only : a minimum of five universities , eligible institutions , industries and companies in the participating partner countries ;
consortium members from two or more different partner countries may participate in the same project provided the project theme matches the national priorities of all the participating countries .
one of the EU consortium members will act on behalf of the consortium as the Contrac@@ tor of the T@@ emp@@ us project .
the Contrac@@ tor is legally responsible for the administration of the T@@ emp@@ us grant in accordance with the plans presented in the application and the terms of the contract awarded .
the contracting consortium member must be located in the European Union .
either the contractor or a different consortium member from the EU , partner or candidate countries will act on behalf of the consortium as the Coordinator of the T@@ emp@@ us project .
the Coordinator is responsible for the submission of the application , for the management , coordination and monitoring of the project activities and the coordination of consortium members , for the assessment of achieved outcomes and for the verification of reports on activities .
this must , however , be clearly justified and evidence of the capability to hold the responsibility of coordination should be given in the project application .
such experts can be higher education representatives and Institution Building specialists with prior involvement in T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are projects and possibly with experience in the development of the specific output to be disseminated .
their participation may be financed from the T@@ emp@@ us grant on the invitation of one of the consortium members and if justified in the original application and accompanied by curriculum vit@@ ae .
preparing and running a T@@ emp@@ us Project means concei@@ ving and reaching one main objective with a pre ­ defined method and strategy .
the following paragraphs are intended to provide the applicant with an overview of what is expected from T@@ emp@@ us projects .
T@@ emp@@ us projects are goal oriented , which means they need to have a clearly defined goal or objective from the outset .
both the management structure and the activities should be organised so as to achieve the planned end result in the most efficient way .
exploiting the strengths of each consortium member and monitoring the quality and direction of the outcomes is essential .
it is important that each consortium member 's contribution to the project is clearly indicated in the application .
the letter from the partner country consortium member shall , in addition , indicate how the project fits in the development strategy of the respective organisation , in the context of the reform of the higher education system .
when preparing a project proposal , it is important to clearly outline the logic of the proposal .
please use the following guidelines when discussing the project preparation within the consortium ( more details are also given in the application form ) .
this will help you in the process of designing your project .
the analysis should explain clearly why this need has arisen and how the beneficiary consortium member aims to tackle this need .
project objective
bearing in mind the long ­ term objective and in line with the bottom ­ up approach , con@@ sor@@ tia themselves will define the project specific ( or short @@@ -@@ @ term ) objective .
con@@ sor@@ tia will also have to identify the specific outcomes that will be generated during the project and that will lead to the achievement of the project objective .
the outcomes to be produced during the project implementation should be described in concrete terms .
they should be logically linked to each other and should be specific , measurable and realistic given the duration of the project .
producing all planned outcomes will mean that the project objective has been reached .
a series of concrete activities should be planned in order to produce the expected outcomes .
each outcome will have at least one activity linked to it .
the project application should give details of the physical and non physical inputs or resources needed for the activities to take place .
these resources can be thought of in terms of human resources , equipment , material and travel .
& Ris@@ ks The achievement of outcomes should not be beyond the control of the project consortium .
however , project partners should also be aware of any external situation , which might affect the success of the project , and take it into consideration as subject to assumption .
this might be , for example , the collaboration of local institutions in the planning of activities .
having identified the assumptions , or external factors , which could affect the project objective , a strategy should be defined to address these issues .
dissemination at project level
dissemination can be defined as the transfer of project outputs ( products as well as processes ) to persons and organisations that are not directly involved in a project .
dissemination is of utmost importance as it maxim@@ ises the impact of the programme and increases the return on the investments made .
additional beneficiaries of dissemination include representatives of other universities , institutions , industries and companies and local and / or national authorities etc .
it is important to have lasting benefits of project outcomes so as to ensure sustainability beyond the period of funding .
a high visibility of outputs , networking activities , feedback from end ­ users and official recognition contribute to increased sustainability .
dissemination can involve the tangible and the intangible outputs of the project .
needs have to be analysed prior to dissemination .
it is therefore important to evaluate the demand for the product .
the target audience for disseminating each of the outputs should be carefully identified .
it is also important to identify the most suitable dissemination vehicle for a given output and for the target group identified .
the press can be a very useful medium for informing a wide audience about the process or " intangible " results of a project .
news@@ letters can be a simple but effective tool for spreading the results of a project , or the programme in general .
a mailing list can be set up using contacts from all the partners .
if a Web site is created for the project , effective links to other relevant sites have to be created .
e ­ mail can be used as a networking device to disseminate results beyond the partner ­ network .
bulletin Board Systems and news@@ groups can be used to bring the results to the attention of a broader audience and to exchange ideas and experiences .
conferences , seminars and other such events are a good opportunity to inform other interested parties about the results of the project .
these may be very effective for presenting certain kinds of tangible outputs and for establishing personal contacts .
training seminars can be very appropriate when the output is " intangible , " e.g. for the dissemination of project management skills .
dissemination Tow@@ ards of outputs i@@ vi@@ thin T@@ emp@@ us III : a comprehensive strategy
linking the dissemination actors : dissemination should link the specific competencies of a broader network of actors into a comprehensive framework .
the European Commission intends in particular to strengthen the role of the national authorities , the National T@@ emp@@ us Offices / T@@ emp@@ us Information Points and the European Training Foundation in output dissemination .
transfer of know @@@ -@@ @ how from T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are to T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is : the T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is str@@ and of the programme should benefit from the wealth of know ­ how accumulated within the former T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are str@@ and .
in particular , representatives of candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe can be invited as experts .
dissemination of existing best outputs .
while T@@ emp@@ us has focused so far on the development of new outputs , T@@ emp@@ us III should , wherever possible , lead to the dissemination of existing best outputs .
they should in particular provide for evaluation prior to dissemination as well as to the analysis of needs in particular areas .
equal opportunities
the T@@ emp@@ us programme is intended to contribute to implementing the principle of equal opportunities in order to ensure that no group of citizens is excluded from its activities by promoting in particular :
♦ equal opportunities for women and men ( gender perspective )
♦ equal opportunities for disabled persons .
project promo@@ ters are therefore asked to include in their project the respect and promotion of equal opportunities for all groups of citizens .
this section applies to all types of T@@ emp@@ us Joint European and Networking Projects .
successful applicants will be awarded one contract for the duration of the project .
♦ total maximum of 500,000 euro for a full three year period
♦ total maximum of 300,000 euro for a full two year period
this is a maximum amount only and one of the main criteria for assessment of projects will be a well justified cost ­ benefit analysis .
the grant is intended to finance , either partially or totally , the costs of implementing the project 's proposed activities .
the total grant will be split into annual amounts , which will be paid to the contractor subject to the progress made towards the approved project objective .
the precise financial rules will be specified in the contract .
contractual period
the project 's activities must be completed and the grant spent within the contractual period .
taxes and duties
equipment purchased and services provided under the T@@ emp@@ us project are exempt from VAT .
taxes , duties and charges ( such as customs and import duties ) shall in any event be excluded from EU financing .
the grant awarded may be used to cover the following expenses : staff Co@@ sts , Equipment , Co@@ sts for Prin@@ ting & Publishing , Other Co@@ sts , over@@ heads , Travel Co@@ sts and Co@@ sts of Stay for Staff and Students . the following ceilings should be applied :
equipment : maximum 20 % of the total grant
as a general principle , the total staff costs may not exceed 25 % of the total grant in a given year .
moreover , additional hours will be financed at the normal hourly rate and not at the higher rate usually applied .
staff costs are divided into two main categories , administrative staff costs and academic staff costs .
the partners involved in T@@ emp@@ us projects are expected to invest part of their own staff resources in carrying out tasks .
fees to Academic Staff ( for all countries )
fees may be paid to academic staff to cover exceptional , limited and strictly justifiable academic tasks not performed as part of regular duties .
these tasks include course development , the development and adaptation of teaching materials , and the preparation and teaching of intensive courses especially developed for the project .
replacement Co@@ sts ( for EU Member States only )
replacement costs can be paid for EU academic staff and Institution Building experts carrying out teaching assignments at universities and institutions in the partner countries for a minimum continuous period of one month and a maximum of ten months .
costs can only be covered when proof is provided that the staff concerned have actually been replaced for the time involved .
replacement costs are limited to an absolute maximum of € 2,500 per person / per month .
equipment
equipment may only be purchased for the partner country universities involved in the consortium and only when it is essential for the achievement of the project objective .
equipment may not exceed 20 % . of the total grant awarded .
IP@@ IL@@ l@@ E@@ A.@@ ö@@ l@@ H ^ ^ ö@@ n@@ ri@@ Ë that the purchase of equipment for networking projects is only eligible for universities not previously involved in a T@@ emp@@ us project or unless absolutely necessary for dissemination purposes .
equipment for dissemination of results is eligible but on a very limited scale .
organisations in the partner country which will participate in the project 's dissemination may receive basic communication equipment , selected books and teaching aids .
please note that under no circumstances may equipment be purchased for research purposes .

over@@ heads include station@@ ery , photocopying , office supplies , postage and telecommunication costs directly related to the project , but exclude staff costs and equipment .
the maximum amount for over@@ heads is 2.5 % ( fixed rate cost ) or 5 % ( actual costs ) of the total annual grant .
grants for staff travel are intended to cover travel , accommodation , subsistence and personal insurance costs .
arrangements for personal insurance will be made by the consortium members .
grants for visits may be awarded to all categories of teaching and administrative staff permanently or temporarily employed by a consortium member .
at least half of the participants travelling from partner countries to the European Union should be teachers , post@@ graduates and / or administrators preferably under 40 years of age when they start their visit to the Union .
they will have to declare their willingness to return to their country and to their home university / institution , in order to contribute to the further development of higher education .

for study periods abroad it is important to note that the host university can claim institutional costs to cover the costs incurred as a result of receiving students from abroad .
the T@@ emp@@ us contribution to university institutional costs is allocated as follows :
individual Mob@@ ility Gran@@ ts ( IM@@ Gs ) are intended to complement the structural approach of Networking Projects funded under T@@ emp@@ us and for each partner country limited funding will be allocated to them .
between 10 to 50 IM@@ Gs will be financed per country per deadline .
IM@@ Gs support visits which can take place either from partner countries to the EU Member States or vice @@@ -@@ @ versa , from partner countries to other partner countries or to the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe .
types of visits eligible for funding
these projects are implemented by a network of university faculties / departments or academic associations representing particular disciplines .
visits with the aim of participating in networking activities shall contribute to the analysis of development within specific fields and ensure compatibility with recognised standards in higher education .
this will give participants the opportunity for exchange of results achieved by T@@ emp@@ us projects , to benefit from the dissemination of outputs under the Networking Projects as well as to establish contacts for future cooperation .

the T@@ emp@@ us Programme is the trans@@ European cooperation scheme for higher education . adopted by the Council of Ministers of the European Union ( EU ) on 7 May 1990 , the programme was addressed to the central and eastern European countries ( T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are ) .
on 29 April 1993 a new four @@@ -@@ @ year phase from the academic year 1994 / 95 and the inclusion of the New Independent States and Mongolia were approved .
T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is and T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are were seen as two parallel but separate schemes in administrative and budgetary terms .
on 21 November 1996 * both T@@ emp@@ us Ph@@ are and T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is were extended for a further two years from the academic year 1998 / 99 .
the T@@ emp@@ us Programme has been designed as a major human resources development scheme aiming to strengthen the ability of the higher education sector to meet national policies and priorities .
T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is is a " bottom @@@ -@@ @ up " programme responsive to the specific needs of individual institutions in the partner countries .
projects are formulated by universities in the partner countries in cooperation with their counterparts from the European Union , where the EU universities contribute their know @@@ -@@ @ how and experience .
T@@ emp@@ us is administered by the European Commission ( D@@ G XX@@ II - Education , Training and Youth ) with technical assistance provided by the T@@ emp@@ us Department of the European Training Foundation .
national T@@ emp@@ us Information Points , established by the authorities in each of the partner countries , assist in providing information about the programme .

objectives OF TE@@ MP@@ US T@@ AC@@ IS
the T@@ ac@@ is Programme supports the process of transformation to market economies and democratic societies in the New Independent States and Mongolia .
within this framework , the T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is objective is to promote the development of the higher education systems in these partner countries .
T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is does this by providing financing to encourage interaction and balanced cooperation between higher education institutions in the partner countries and the European Union .
♦ the reform of higher education structures and institutions and their management ;
project applications to the T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is Programme must fall under the priority subject areas specific to the partner country concerned .
only applications which comply with the priority areas specific to each partner country will be taken into consideration for financing .
how IS TE@@ MP@@ US T@@ AC@@ IS funded ?
on a annual or bi@@ ennial basis , the partner countries receive a national allocation from the overall T@@ ac@@ is budget .
the national authorities , in consultation with the European Commission , then reserve a part of their national allocation for T@@ emp@@ us .
Ukraine received EC@@ U 5 million and the Russian Federation EC@@ U 8 million for 1996 only .
which CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES CA@@ N PAR@@ T@@ IC@@ IP@@ ATE ?
only the following partner countries can apply for T@@ emp@@ us T@@ ac@@ is projects in 1998 :
Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden United Kingdom
in addition to the EU Member States , other countries belonging to the G@@ 24 Group may also participate :
T@@ emp@@ us funds may only be used for activities between EU Member States and the partner countries .
non @@@ -@@ @ EU G@@ 24 countries must fund their own participation in T@@ emp@@ us projects .
T@@ emp@@ us projects are prepared and implemented by con@@ sor@@ tia of higher education institutions in keeping with the " bottom @@@ -@@ @ up " approach which character@@ ises T@@ emp@@ us .
in a Compact Project , the second partner country institution can be an enterprise or an organisation instead of a higher education institution ;
♦ two or three EU higher education institutions based at least in two different EU Member States .
optionally , a consortium may also include :
♦ one higher education institution based in another G@@ 24 country ( see the H@@ ST in the section 1.3 ) .
it is important that each consortium member 's contribution to the project be clearly indicated in the application .
EU institutions within a consortium shall represent a coherent pool of resources , responding to the needs of the NIS and Mongolian partner institutions involved .
the letter from the partner country institution shall , in addition , indicate how the project fits in with the development strategy of the institution .
this letter shall be signed both by the Rec@@ tor ( ensuring the institutional support ) and the person directly responsible for the project ( see also section III of the Application form ) .
♦ all higher education institutions recognised by the national authorities ;
♦ all classical and technical multi @@@ -@@ @ disciplinary universities which have a state licence , regardless of the kind of funding ;
♦ other higher education institutions may be considered eligible only if this is indicated in the respective annex on country @@@ -@@ @ specific priorities ;
♦ other types of organisations ( enterprises , government agencies , networks and associations , etc . ) can be consortium members only within the framework of the Compact Projects .
institutions that are mainly research @@@ -@@ @ oriented or attached to / part of an Academy of Science are not eligible to be consortium members .
they may only participate as teachers , staff or students attached to an institution member of a consortium .
types OF PRO@@ J@@ ECT funded B@@ Y TE@@ MP@@ US T@@ AC@@ IS
only con@@ sor@@ tia working with the Russian Federation , Ukraine and Uzbekistan may apply for a To@@ int European Project ( J@@ EP ) .
joint European Projects are three @@@ -@@ @ year projects whose overall aim is to contribute to the long @@@ -@@ @ term development and renewal of the partner countries ' higher education .
in the shorter @@@ -@@ @ term , they aim to create centres disseminating good practice to other institutions in the partner countries .
course development can be undertaken at graduate or post@@ graduate level , as well as for the introduction of short @@@ -@@ @ cycle , practically oriented higher education courses .
the introduction of new management practices and structures in the partner country at the institutional level or faculty level may also be part of a J@@ EP .
however , this should represent only a component of a J@@ EP , while course development and related activities should remain the core of the project .
it will also make clear what are the needs that the project will address in order to overcome the identified problems .
this analysis should form the basis of the J@@ EP proposal .
all countries may apply for a Compact Project ( CP ) . compact Projects are the main instruments to operate in the field of university management and administration .
compact Projects can last up to two years and they should address precisely defined and short @@@ -@@ @ term needs of the partner institutions .
they should be self contained and concentrate on one objective which can be achieved by the end of the project .
compact Projects may be drawn up according to one of the following three models .
University Management and External Relations
introduction of new management practices and structures in the partner country institutions , for example at institute or faculty level .
the aim is to improve the short@@ - and long @@@ -@@ @ term planning capacity of the institution , the management of day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day operations , the effectiveness of international relation offices , etc .
improvement of universities ' international relations and contact building . this may include the strengthening of international networks , the implementation of well @@@ -@@ @ thought out mobility plans to establish new international contacts , etc .
strengthening of links between education institutions in the partner countries .
strengthening of links between the partner institution and other parties in the partner countries .
Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia and Mongolia only .
compact Projects in this area should focus on curriculum development in one subject area among the priorities listed in the respective country annex .
drawing up of a dissemination strategy and methods ( e.g. publishing , distribution , presentations , training sessions , thematic workshops , distance learning materials ) .
when preparing a project proposal , it is important to make the logic of the project clear .
please use the following guidelines when discussing the project preparation within the consortium ( more details are given in the attached Application Form ) .
the overall long @@@ -@@ @ term objective of a project should be to support the development of the higher education systems in the partner countries , as stated in the T@@ emp@@ us objectives in section 2 .
bearing in mind the long @@@ -@@ @ term objective and in line with the bottom @@@ -@@ @ up approach , con@@ sor@@ tia themselves will define the project specific ( or short @@@ -@@ @ term ) objective .
the specific objective should describe the improved situation which is expected at the partner institutions at the end of the J@@ EP or CP .
this objective should be specific , measurable , achievable , realistic , and time @@@ -@@ @ bound .
con@@ sor@@ tia will also have to identify the specific outcomes that will be generated during the project and that will lead to the achievement of the project objective .
the outcomes to be produced during the project implementation should be described in concrete terms .
the outcomes should be limited in number and as well be specific , measurable , and realistic given the project duration .
the project application should give details of the physical and non @@@ -@@ @ physical inputs or resources needed for the activities to take place .
assumptions and risks
you should be aware of any external situation which is beyond the control of the project that might affect the success of the project .
although the consortium will not be able to address these problems , they should be identified as assumptions and / or risk factors .
the above factors ( the project logic ) should be decided and agreed upon by all consortium members .
this will help you to reach a common understanding of the project objective and expected outcomes or results .
in the Application Form you will find a Log@@ ical Framework Matrix which you should fill in to summar@@ ise the logic of your project and its key elements .
( re ) ti@@ aining and practical placements for teaching / administrative staff from the partner country institutions ;
♦ short , targeted intensive courses ( including language ti@@ aining ) for groups of teaching / ad@@ r@@ nin@@ istr@@ ative staff from the partner country ;
♦ missions for organisational and coordinating purposes within the EU and missions for dissemination purposes within the partner country ;
♦ dissemination of the project 's outcomes to other parties in the partner country : other educational institutions , regional education authorities , the business community , etc . , as appropriate .
♦ administrative tasks which are directly linked to the implementation of the project , e.g. the ad@@ ir@@ ú@@ ni@@ stration and coordination of project activities and planning of meetings ;
this direct link should be clearly explained .
however , fees to attend such meetings C@@ AN@@ NOT be paid from the T@@ emp@@ us grant ;
mobility should be organised for groups of students travelling together and must make a clearly defined contribution to the achievement of the project 's objective .
J@@ E@@ Ps ON@@ LY : short , targeted intensive courses ( including language ti@@ aining ) for groups of students from the partner country .
grants for visits may be awarded to all categories of teaching and ad@@ r@@ nin@@ istr@@ ative staff employed by , or temporarily working under the guidance of , a consortium member .

the T@@ emp@@ us grant will be provided through a contract awarded to the coordinating institution ( the contractor ) which must be located in a European Union member state .
such an exception must be clearly justified and evidence of the capability to hold the responsibility of coordination should be given in the project application .
the grants are intended to finance , either partially or totally , the costs of implementing the project 's envisaged activities .
for To@@ int European Projects .
the average sum awarded to J@@ EP will be approximately EC@@ U 500,000 for a full three @@@ -@@ @ year period .
however , this will be subject to the allocation made to T@@ emp@@ us from the T@@ ac@@ is budget for each of the partner countries .
the total amount will be split into annual allocations , which will be paid to the contractor subject to the progress made towards the initial objective .
the project 's activities must be completed and the grant spent within the period November 1998 - October 2001 .
the maximum sum awarded to a CP will be EC@@ U 200,000 for a full two @@@ -@@ @ year period .
the project 's activities must be completed and the grant spent within the period November 1998 - October 2000 .
mobility costs for both staff and student mobility , which should not represent less than 40 % of the total grant .
payments and salaries paid for language preparation course and for translations are also included under administrative staff costs , when provided by consortium staff members ( otherwise see Other Co@@ sts ) .
as a sign of their commitment to trans@@ European cooperation , the higher education institutions involved in T@@ emp@@ us projects are expected to invest a part of their own staff resources in the fulfilment of other types of tasks .
these tasks include course development , development and adaptation of teaching materials , preparation and teaching of intensive courses especially developed for the project .
this consortium member may employ them , or otherwise invite them , to contribute their particular expertise to the activities organised by the consortium .
this involvement is only possible if justified in the original application and accompanied by a curriculum vit@@ ae .
please note that academic staff costs can only be paid on a limited scale and if related to a precise task justified by the project .
in any case , salaries and fees may not exceed local rates , whether in the EU or any other country .
moreover , additional hours will be financed at the normal hourly rate and not at the higher rate usually applied to extra @@@ -@@ @ hours .
total staff costs should not exceed 25 % of the total grant awarded .
equipment can only be provided for the partner country universities and then only if it is essential for the implementation of the project objective .
the equipment purchased must be installed and be functioning .
the purchase of premises , vehicles , research and / or development equipment , large piece of scientific equipment , portable computers and furniture is not eligible for T@@ emp@@ us funding .
equipment purchased with the T@@ emp@@ us grant must originate from an EU Member State or a partner country .
equipment should not exceed 20 % of the total grant , unless justified by the specific project objective and duly detailed .
this category covers costs of publishing and printing of mainly teaching materials , and other documentation that may be necessary to reach the project objective .
♦ institutional costs only if related to student mobility ( it applies to J@@ E@@ Ps only ) .
the T@@ emp@@ us contribution to university institutional costs is allocated as follows :
over@@ heads include administration costs , office supplies , postage and telephone costs directly related to the project , but exclude staff costs .
the contractor provides a detailed calculation of all general expenses up to 5 % of the total grant awarded .
mobility grants will be awarded mainly to university teaching staff and administr@@ ati@@ ve@@ 2 staff .
on a limited scale and if appropriate , teachers , trainers or experts from non@@ - consortium members who are invited to contribute their particular expertise to the project activities may also benefit from a mobility grant .
grants are available for the following types of mobility :
teaching / training assignments ( to provide courses for others )
practical placements in enterprises for staff ( academic and administrative , in the EU only )
participation of 1 person to the 2 @@@ -@@ @ day annual Coordin@@ ators ' Meeting organised every year by the T@@ emp@@ us Department of the European Training Foundation and held in Tor@@ ino , Italy .
e.g. university staff such as libr@@ arians , international relations officers , etc .
this direct link should be clearly explained .
however , fees to attend such meetings C@@ AN@@ NOT be paid from the T@@ emp@@ us grant .
the Staff Mob@@ ility Co@@ sts comprises two components , costs of stay and travel costs .
costs of stay include reasonably priced accommodation and subsistence , local transport ( bus and taxis ) and reasonable daily allowance for mis@@ cell@@ aneous expenses while abroad .
based on the number of mobility flows foreseen by each project application , the cost of stay are computer calculated by applying the following amounts ( in EC@@ U ) .
please note that an important difference exists , i.e. student mobility is only eligible for J@@ E@@ Ps .
compact Projects will not include student mobility .
con@@ sor@@ tia should give priority to those students who intend to undertake teaching assignment at their university afterwards .
grants may be awarded to under@@ graduate students ( in their final phase of study ) , and to post@@ graduate students undertaking further study ( including doctoral students ) .
the period abroad should form an integral part of students ' studies and it should contribute to their home degree or qualification .
grants may be awarded for the following three types of activity :
study periods Prac@@ tical placements in enterprises ( in EU only )
duration of student mobility can not be less that a month and not more than a year .
student Mob@@ ility Gran@@ ts are intended to cover costs of stay and travel costs .
costs of stay in the EU
the costs related to the use of materials ( computers , laboratories , library , etc . ) and to registration fees for courses , seminars , sym@@ posi@@ a , etc. are not eligible for funding .
institutional costs incurred by university when hosting students in mobility are eligible , please refer to the heading Other Co@@ sts .
travel costs cover the national transport and international flights at economy fare to and from the partner country .
only actual travel costs will be paid from the grant .
the consortium will calculate the total amount required for travel costs , based on the number of mobility flows planned in the project application .
efforts should be made to find cheap travel arrangements for students .

session IX .
the second , held in Mar@@ chl@@ 9@@ 93 , dealt with the role and functioning of statistical information systems in a market economy .
the main objectives of the seminar were the following :
the participants were presented the most advanced technologies used in Western countries for statistical computing , as well as the solutions adopted by other countries in economic transition like Poland and Hungary .
this volume is organised in accordance with the seminar presentation .
each session , chaired by a different chairman , presents papers , followed by comments by the discus@@ s@@ ants and discussion from the floor .
session I provides a vision of the role o@@ fin@@ formation technologies in a modern public administration by focusing on challenges , productivity gains , quality improvement and training needs implied by them .
session IV concentrates on the different aspects of deci@@ sion@@ making concerning statistical computing and the main components of a modern computing organisation .
in session VII representative of donor organisations discuss their views and prospects concerning the funding of modernisation of statistical computing in the CIS countries .
I would like to welcome you to this Euro@@ stat seminar , which will be devoted to strategy for statistical computing .
statistics belongs to the information society in which we live and computing science is a tool to enable us to collect , process and disseminate statistical information .
computers and telecommunications therefore , will be the most powerful tool to be used by stati@@ sti@@ cians , not only today but also in the future .
the purpose of the seminar is to exchange experiences during the last ten years of computing techniques , which have developed considerably .
there has been a kind of revolution in this field and , as a result , we have to manage these quick changes as soon as possible .
I refer to Central European countries and some Eastern European countries which started their transition ahead of the countries belonging to the CIS .
during this exchange , I hope that we will be able to develop our thinking in and deepen our knowledge of the statistical computing field .
we will have to tackle technical issues but the purpose is mainly to take into account the organizational consequences of computer@@ ization .
it is the reason for which this seminar takes place at a high level , that is to say , at the strategic level , the upper management level in your national statistical institute .
due to costs being high , we shall also discuss the question of financing .
finally , this seminar is part of the T@@ AC@@ IS program for which Euro@@ stat is attempting to organize cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States , and Euro@@ stat 's role within T@@ AC@@ IS is coordinated with the role played by other international organizations .
representatives from international organizations will be contributing to our discussions .
computers are , of course , absolutely crucial when it comes to organizing statistics today .

I am going to speak about the environment in which statistical computing is finding itself in the European Union and where it will find itself in the next ten years within the information society .
the experience we have had is that information society is coming up very , very fast .
what seemed to us five or ten years ago as something very remote in the future , has become our day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day business .
a Russian translation will hopefully be available to you before you leave the seminar .
it is a vision of what is coming at a later stage .
smaller public sectors , carrying the essential functions to ensure a good functioning of democracy and market economy
better effectiveness : reaching effectively clear goals indicated by governing authorities
better efficiency : efficient use of scarce resources ( financial and human resources )
key factors : information training technology
recommendations to the European Council , Brussels 26 May 1994 .
they have to use financial and human resources more efficiently because these are scarce .
governments and public administrations : more efficient , transparent and responsive public services
small businesses : more effective management , better access to training , better links with customers
you can see from the tables what this revolution brings to the various parts of the societies in which we live .
the second category of people who can benefit from the information society are creative entrepreneurs .
the possibility to create new products and services , leading to , employment creation .
for regional areas , it means new opportunities to express cultural traditions and minimise remo@@ ten@@ ess .
this is .@@ something familiar to some of your governments and public administrations .
there is also the capacity to become more efficient , more transparent , and more rapidly responsive to requests through this high technology .
promote public awareness : small businesses public administrations young generations
enabling the market to create capacity for various suppliers or equipment , to communicate one with another , are also very important aspects .
our children are much faster than we are in technologies . they are the potential market , the creative minds .
the more you use information technology in this revolution , the more you have to make sure that there is good protection of privacy .
we already have countries such as Denmark whose public administration is widely computer@@ ised and has a high level of privacy protection .
this is being discussed now , essentially in the United States , and is beginning to be discussed in Western Europe .
it is what is called information highway ; it is what enables us to exchange not only voices but also images and data , the whole idea of multimedia communications .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
Tele@@ working : distance learning : network for universities and research institutes : tel@@ ematic services for SM@@ E 's
you have all come to Luxembourg to work together and not only is it a long task , but we also have language problems .
third , exchange programs with universities and various institutes .
this is something basically described previously .
eighth , electronic ten@@ dering . this issue was discussed earlier in the seminar as being a lengthy process .
this will give a more efficient administration at lower cost .
it is being developed right now . the idea is to have , three years from now , 10 % of all public ten@@ dering being done through this electronic ten@@ dering .
Euro@@ stat is already quite advanced in promoting the use of E@@ DI techniques .
thus , statistics will probably be at the forefront with customs with the use of this trans @@@ -@@ @ European public administration network .
and finally , tenth , city information / highways .
this will bring to the household a lot of services and information on city management .
as you see from the data and targets I have given , this global information society is not years ahead .
it is starting now and many targets will have to be reached by 1995 , 1996 , 1997 or 2000 .

opportunities abundance of micro data more efficiency in collecting and disseminating data lower costs in statistical work
given the fact that statistics is already involved with computing activities , you have to keep ahead of the technological changes .
this means that your infrastructure should be examined and adjusted to this revolution .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
it can be very useful and can be merged electronically . an information network is the whole idea of networking .
the problems you will have in this regard will be discussed later during this seminar .
the question from all I have said is , What is relevant now to the national information systems of your countries ? ( tab 8 )
the leap can be made to the next generation , that is , electronic data transmission and so on . your systems have to be changed dramatically .
there will be major constraints and these should not be discounted .
the first one is an institutional constraint .
the second constraint , a financial constraint , is linked to the first constraint .
the initial investments are high , although your return on the investment will be high also .
however , if there is no support from your political authorities , there will be no access to finance .
we will find the financing for it . the European Commission will be very active in promoting it .
by its very nature , the production of statistics is data processing .
producing official statistics encompasses a range of well @@@ -@@ @ known processes , all of which should be aided by IT .
I shall briefly mention some of the promising tools available .
an important distinction is between surveys and administrative registers .
as we all know , tim@@ eliness is one of the most important quality parameters of many statistics .
one of the techniques that may be employed in order to avoid some of the work processes is electronic data inter@@ change , E@@ DI .
in this way data are entered in machine @@@ -@@ @ readable form simultaneously with the inter@@ viewing .
and validity control and editing can be carried out in the same process , entirely or in part .
in Denmark , this technique is now being used in all our surveys among persons , using the Dutch Bla@@ ise system ^ .
this has proven to be a big step forward in the sense that it has saved costs and spe@@ eded up the publishing of final results considerably .
the respondent goes through the questionnaire and fills it in on his own micro computer .
when the dis@@ ket@@ te is returned to Dan@@ marks St@@ ati@@ sti@@ k , the respondent has already entered the data and has been confronted with in@@ consist@@ encies and apparent errors .
administrative records kept by public agencies have always been an important source of statistics .
but under some circumstances the usefulness of registers can be increased far beyond that point .
Dan@@ marks St@@ ati@@ sti@@ k makes use of the CP@@ R , tax registers , wage registers , social benefits registers , a central register of buildings and dwell@@ ings , and many more .
the use of this system means that all human statistics are coherent and that even the population and housing census is based solely on the registers .
it may be considered to create such systems in other countries .
but as mentioned earlier , I have to restrict myself and focus on a few issues .
for many years , dissemination has largely taken the form of books , or other publications in print , and this is still the case even though things are now changing .
it is evident that electronic dissemination of statistics is becoming increasingly important .
in many cases , they want to include statistics in their own information product for sale on the market .
the increase in demand for statistics on electronic dissemination media has been somewhat slower than expected ten years ago , and consequently the development of these media has not gone far .
but they are extremely useful in two respects :
they allow users to have direct access to large amounts of detailed statistics and to get an immediate answer to almost any question within the information power of official statistics
it should also be used in the very processing of data from one form to another .
many resour@@ c@@ econ@@ sum@@ ing projects aiming at creating the meta database have failed , among them one in my own office .
but work is being done in several countries .
however , the total database is not foreseen until the year 2000 .
consequently , there would have to be a central computing department .
in the centr@@ alised organisation , there is a strong professional tradition in the computing department .
the concentration of skilled staff will create an environment that supports professionalism and helps the systems analysts and the programmers to keep up their skills .
according to the author 's experience , a large degree of decentr@@ alisation is advisable . the statistical branches should command the computer specialist resources necessary to develop their own systems .
it also makes it difficult to support the software products and give an efficient training .
outsourcing or in@@ house computing
I am absolutely convinced that this is a mistake when we talk about statistical computing .
it is important to keep in mind that the CS@@ O should be an integrated part of the total information system .
information should be inter@@ changed and processed in a way that is expedient to the whole system .

however , some forms of financing are not covered by this , especially leasing .
today we have listened to very interesting reports and information given by our western colleagues .
for us , information on how the collection and processing of statistical information is organised is most useful .
in Belarus and other ex ­ USSR republics the organisational structure of the statistical offices is much the same .
we have inherited it from the system which operated in the former Soviet Union .
preparatory work is currently being done on projects covering enterprise , foreign trade and financial statistics , based on statistical registers .
training has already been given at international seminars and seminars organised by the statistical offices of western countries for about 40 % of the staff of the central offices .
however , it does not always make the impact it should mainly because of the language barrier .
we have therefore made efforts to organise foreign language training for our staff .
in the first half of 1994 , at the L@@ ingu@@ istic University , 20 of our staff attended foreign language courses .
many of them have travelled to western countries on official duty trips .
at the moment , there are specialists in each department who know English or German .
this has considerably facilitated work with the statistical material of the international economic organisations and national statistical offices .
training in English will be continued in 1995 .
the difficulties in converting the statistical system are largely aggravated by the fact that the country is in a deep economic crisis .
the state is not in a position to ear@@ mark sufficient funds for the technical re@@ equip@@ ping of the statistical authorities .
therefore , we are looking for ways of dealing with these problems using other sources , including loans to our state and any other aid that can be provided by western countries .
we are certain that in the very near future our economy will become stabil@@ ised and begin to develop .
these changes have a particularly positive effect on our relations with international organizations such as Euro@@ stat and the OECD .
technically and financially , the situation is difficult .
we received some financing support , of which approximately half@@ was spent on equipment .
the national network is organized into district , regional , and central levels .
the Directorate of Statistical Information at the centre collects and stores statistical data .
approximately 90 % of the statistics are now stored at the national centre , where they are analyzed and processed .
perhaps , presently , the bulk of this work is at regional rather than national level .
Kyrgy@@ stan experts receive considerable assistance from Euro@@ stat .
about 30 managers from strategic services are attending English @@@ -@@ @ language courses financed by Euro@@ stat .
it will help them make contacts in western countries .
what we have heard from the Danish , French and Euro@@ stat speakers is extremely interesting .

an overview of the current situation would be too long for this discussion . I shall try to focus on what we expect from this exchange o@@ fin@@ formation .
the importance of the technical aspect is obvious and does not need further explanation .
let us start with data collection .
it is extremely difficult to computer@@ ize the entire system .
we need to find the ways and means to process effectively the enormous volume of information that is derived , for instance , from a population census .
one option is to use scanners but they are not accurate enough for processing all the information we have .
it is our intention to assist CIS countries in implementing new technologies .
however , anc@@ illary costs are not decreasing . as much as hardware and software prices going down , do not underestimate certain related costs .
the more users there are and the more rapidly systems change , the more support systems for users is required .
there are three main rules of management in a computer system . the first is what w@@ c call the Organization of subsidi@@ arity .
the third rule of management which will most probably emerge during this seminar is cohesion .
a conclu@@ sive set of rules is needed as far as hardware is concerned .
these mistakes occurred often at the beginning of our computer@@ ization process .
very often the technical side is working well but the organizational side is not .
this training often takes a lot of time and operating costs often become higher than what was thought at the outset .
there should be a number of people who manage the methods , that is , design and implement the master plans mentioned earlier for projects .
these experts , who know software very well , select the software and the telecommunications networks .
for example , someone who is a specialist in operating systems differs from someone who is a specialist in organizational systems .
these changes are mainly the result of the introduction of the single chip computer in the late sev@@ enti@@ es , replacing mini and main@@ frame computers .
the design of computer assisted interviews looks very much like the design of a traditional computer program .
one of the great advantages of a questionnaire as a knowledge domain is that the rules ( the " knowledge " ) governing it are often very explicit .
finally , after some post str@@ ati@@ fication stage the results of the survey should be tab@@ ulated and published .
as with many of the above steps , the programs involved should connect seamlessly with each other .
in my opinion , one of the reasons for this lack of popularity might be their often un@@ friendly , main@@ frame oriented , user interfaces .
here , the soc@@ alled Client / Server architecture will probably be the most dominant scheme in E@@ DP .

there are no main@@ frames , although there could be one or two servers which were main@@ frames .
an important feature of this structure is that around each server there are a number of client computers on everyone 's desktop .
they are arranged in such a way that , for each branch of statistics , there is a natural structure of server and client computers .
I have a paper I prepared three years ago I claimed that the financing of PCs was not really a problem .
not only did we use PCs for word processing , but we also introduced a system of E @@@ -@@ @ mail .
this is considered a hidden cost because these experts have a distributive role and do not belong to a service .
but this is at the same time a hidden benefit since these people are available and close to the PC users and not distant experts like main@@ frame experts .
we have to see what products are becoming popular to use them for statistical purposes .
in particular we should favour stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed interfaces .
- the statistical system may need to be redesigned in terms of both data and functions because of the new computing strategies .
the new administrative and technological scenarios should consider this possibility , which is no longer remote in many countries .

my second remark refers to distributed processing , which , in practice , may use more than two platforms .

computer@@ ization would be the next step .
planning should not take years ; an intermediate set of objectives should be considered .
the proposal for Russia is that certain types of statistics , such as enterprise statistics , should be managed in partnership with one EU country .
Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Italy would be ideal partners for particular types of statistics . contact persons would be needed to " give the partnership a face . "

training should also be adjusted to the home environment of the train@@ ee if it is to be of much use .
public relations work was man@@ tioned during theses days in relation to marketing of the product .
indeed , people should be made aware of statistics and industry should be persuaded to provide data .
credibility will depend on the image that is presented .
the situation varies with each country . some statistical offices derive half their turnover from sales .
the St@@ ati@@ sti@@ sch@@ es Bundes@@ am@@ t is far from reaching that level , but it earns a few million de@@ ut@@ sche marks .
statistics are , after all , an important basis for economic policymaking .
first of all , I should like to introduce myself briefly .
I will conclude by drawing your attention to problems of security , which are of three kinds .
the first problem concerns electronic links .
you have been shown some very fine networked systems which seem to work wonder@@ fully .
this is possible in countries where the telecommunications networks ha@@ ver reach a sufficient level of development . this is not the case in all your countries .
this should be built in from the outset , otherwise you risk setting up a system which will lose credibility because of network break@@ downs .
the second security problem is the men@@ ace of viruses .
virus infections have already cost some big firms very dear .
you must protect yourselves against invasion by viruses , by setting up rigorous procedures , and selecting architectures which are as inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ able as possible .
lastly , the third security problem , protection of files against theft .
I was very happy to hear our colleague from Georgia speaking very frankly on this matter .
this danger is great , and has several aspects .
how could you sell your statistical data on behalf of your Office if they can be disseminated unoff@@ icially in this way ?
the second type of risk concerns theft of your individual data , and here I am basing my remarks on what Mr Fran@@ ch@@ et said yesterday evening on the anxiety of the European countries to protect people 's private lives .
I will tell you a story on this point which explains why I , and a number of French colleagues , are particularly aware of this risk .
during the 1939 @@@ -@@ @ 1945 war , you know that France was occupied by the Germans .
lastly , the third kind of danger which I would mention is that arising from inadequate protection of individual items of data relating to firms .
you have a number of foreign firms which are setting up in your countries and investing capital .
they are therefore playing an important economic r@@ ô@@ le .
you will understand , therefore , that these questions of security must be considered when you are deciding how to expand your inform@@ atics systems .
the Current Sit@@ uation
the situation of statistical computing in New Independent States ( NIS ) is different from one state to another .
my direct knowledge only concerns two countries of central Asia ( Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan ) and the situation is not the same in both of them .
not withstanding this fact , it is possible , in my opinion , to state , in a rather general way , that the current situation of statistical computing systems of NIS has some important drawbacks .
they can be aggregated in four groups :
high centr@@ alisation Systems a ) a strong central computing department i ) which concentrates most of the equipment and staff in inform@@ atics ; ii ) which is responsible for collecting and processing the different statistics .
we mean by this that the information goes essentially in one direction :
the situation is particularly difficult at regional and district level , where there is often no equipment at all .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
statistics is wrong@@ ly linked with politics as a means for making laws and administrations more effective .
except for Russia and Ukraine , most eastern European countries have less than 20 million inhabitants .
in area they are larger than The Netherlands , which has 15 million people .
the Netherlands has one central office with two buildings and no regional or district levels .

the questions arisen by Mr Vil@@ ares are particularly relevant to us .
we could make a cooperative effort to arrive at some solution to those problems .
press conferences are held every quarter and the material is also published in leading newspapers .
according to existing legislation in Ukraine , all information must be submitted to the statistical organs , which violates the industrial secrecy principle .
a system based on personal numbers is supposed to be very efficient statis@@ tically .
great caution must be exercised in such a system .
data protection and confidentiality will depend on a country 's legal provisions .
for instance , in Hungary , the Constitutional Court for@@ bids the use of personal identification codes .
this ban probably stems from a fear of possible misuse of such a system , as was the case during the past 40 years .
the attitude towards personal identification numbers is a problem common to all transition countries .
identification of economic players is another aspect of the problem .
in Hungary , the adoption of the new statistical law prompted a serious discussion in Parliament .
but its use was not accepted for social statistics .

I refer to the point mentioned by Mr Hol@@ der and agree with him : statistical change should start with the organization of small working groups .
in Belarus , we have ongoing projects on price and trade statistics .
these are the areas that require information technology .
the system can be changed starting from individual projects .
as M. Vil@@ ares observed , statistics in CIS countries continue in a certain direction because there has not been a structured reform .
however I believe that the information you have about our system is not completely updated .
many requests from the media have been received and a new type o@@ fin@@ formation is being produced .

however , in order to implement our reforms we need funds .

in small countries such as Georgia governments like to have as much information as possible .
a law on statistics law concerning personal identity numbers was submitted to the parliament and we hope it will be rejected as it may raise serious problems .
relations between the different departments and the central office are governed by certain traditions .
we also need to agree on a financing policy , which is a complicated administrative problem .
the role of regional statistics must be defined .
we regularly organize training courses at different locations in the CIS , for example , Moscow , Minsk , Kiev , and Tashkent ( where a seminar was organized in cooperation with the OECD ) .
session IV
development and Implementation Issues
the transformation of the political , social and economic relations con@@ stituting the environment of the Hungarian statistical system poses new requirements , partly concerning the contents of statistics , and partly the functioning of the statistical service and its legal rules .
with the acceleration of inflation and the growing differences in the society there is high demand for information on living standards , unemployment , CPI , minimum subsistence level .
the accounting system of the enterprises went through a substantial modification .
the financial report of the firms will no longer serve as a basis for the compilation of various economic statistics , first of all National Accounts .
this basis o@@ fin@@ formation sources had to be substituted through other channels .
the government remains the primary user but it 's demand will undergo major changes .
we have to take into consideration the demands of the entering new users such as political parties , the media and the public , last but not least , the business sector .
there is an other long term task and process , this is the adaptation and implementation of the international statistical standards .
there was adopted the new Act on Statistics in Hungary in April 199@@ 3. by the Parliament , which created a different environment for the statistical activity .
to meet the mentioned new requirements it was necessary to make some adjustment in the organisation of the H@@ CS@@ O .
the activity of the H@@ CS@@ O is controlled by a president appointed by the Prime Minister , and by three deputy presidents .
the tasks performed by the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments belonging to the deputies are separated .
one deputy is responsible for social statistics , another is in charge of economic , business statistics , while the third directs the financial administration and also the inform@@ atics department .
the H@@ CS@@ O traditionally has the system of regional offices , organised by the 20 counties .
the functions of the statistical data processing are distributed among the Head Office and 20 Regional Offices .
the Head Office fulfil@@ s the national data demand with performing the different activities , as follows :
- recording , cross @@@ -@@ @ checking and correction of the questionnaires ,
the old Hardware / Software elements of the system :
in the Head Office :
- two IBM 43@@ 61 @@@ -@@ @ 5 computers ( 8 @@@ -@@ @ 8 M@@ byte central memory , 7,@@ 5 G@@ byte disc capacity and 70 terminals attached ,
- SP@@ SS and SAS for statistical analysis ,
- 26 units of MD@@ S@@ 6@@ 40@@ 2 and 6@@ 40@@ 3 magnetic tape data rec@@ orders for central data recording .
in the Regional Offices :
- 22 units of P@@ DP compatible T@@ PA computers with 7@@ 68 K@@ byte memories each and 240 to 300 M@@ byte disc capacity .
- FOR@@ TRA@@ N , C , PA@@ SC@@ AL , D@@ IB@@ OL and D@@ AT@@ AT@@ R@@ IE@@ VE for individual processing .
the network of the central main@@ frame and regional computers were controlled by D@@ EC@@ NET and an in@@ house developed software .
let us list only the most critical issues of those :
- D@@ ue to the privatisation and the change of the total economic system , the number of businesses increases to a multiple of the previously existing ones .
- The statistical system is fundamentally changed , new data collections are established , the questionnaires are changed as well as the classifications and statistical methods .
the quick compilation of data into a database using the old system is impossible .
- An increasing part of the data collections is based upon a representative sampling method .
the as@@ sig@@ nation of the representation scope would require that the databases could be reached from the stati@@ sti@@ cians ' workplaces which today C@@ AN@@ NOT be done .
- The managers in the economic and social fields require an increasing amount of information within a short time .
- For using up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date statistical methods the stati@@ sti@@ cians need to have direct access to the databases .
- In the Regional Offices they did not have H@@ W / S@@ w to be able to service the information dissemination demands expected by the local governments .
- Requirements to have online connection to foreign data bases in spite of the fact that there is a clear demand from both sides for data exchange .
the primary objectives of development is to form the information technology being able to adopt to the changes of the data collection system more flexible than it was before .
it is necessary to grow the efficiency of data processing systems :
- to make shorter the production period from the data collection to the data dissemination ,
- permit quicker data retrieval and data evaluation , data analysis of many aspects ,
- to provide ideal conditions for the stati@@ sti@@ cians for their own work with computers .
- selection , purchase and custom@@ isation of the H@@ W / S@@ w for both the Head Office and the Regional Offices ( servers , UNIX workstations , PCs and network ) ,
- initiate standards in data management and system development as well as in the field of unified identification , description and documentation of statistical indicators , nom@@ encl@@ atures and for the naming conventions in the data bases ,
- study and application of international standards which make data exchange easier ,
- design and development of the metadata base for the description of the elements of the statistical data system ( indicators , nom@@ encl@@ atures , data editing criteria of data collection , entities of data base etc . ) ,
- design and development of the economical and social statistical data bases , the new registers and restructuring the previous data bases ,
- elaboration of techniques and methods for the inter@@ link of the new and earlier data bases ,
- adaptation of the data processing flow to the new environment for each data collection from the data capture to the data evaluation ,
- planning user @@@ -@@ @ friendly tools for end@@ users on the metadata management , the data retrieval from the data bases , interfaces between the difficult end@@ user tools etc . ,
- education and support for the E@@ DP specialists and stati@@ sti@@ cians for using new software elements and techniques ( PCs , SAS , DB@@ MS , end@@ user tools etc . ) ,
the transition into a market economy created numerous socio @@@ -@@ @ economic changes that , by the end of the ' 80s made unavoidable the re @@@ -@@ @ thinking and upgrading of the Hungarian statistical system .
- Financial memorandum ( March 1992 ) , - Call for tender ( 28 , March 1992 ) , - Terms of Reference ( April 1992 ) ,
- Establis@@ h PM@@ U and Program Organisation ( June 1992 ) .
- Installation in Regional Offices ( May , June , July ) ,
- Emer@@ ald installation ( 15 . September - 15 October ) ,
as the result of a long ten@@ dering , evaluation and preparing period the installation was finished on 16 . December 199@@ 3. by the system wide acceptance .
now , everywhere in the Statistical Office there is a common platform with HP / UNIX servers , HP / UNIX workstations and HP V@@ ec@@ tra PC @@@ -@@ @ s .
the main software elements of the system are as follows :
the stati@@ sti@@ cians and IT experts have to work more closely together for the new statistical information system ..
before describing the major changes which should be made in the statistical activity we have to review the functioning system .
for the time being we have annual work programs prepared by the main stages of@@ statistical process .
there is a data collection , capture and transmission plan for the regional offices where the schedule and timing is defined by data collections month by month .
the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments prepare their annual work program too , separated in it the usual , repeated tasks by data collections and the new , methodological , conceptual developments .
finally there is an annual publication plan of the H@@ CS@@ O , which is coordinated by the Pub@@ l@@ ication and Dis@@ sem@@ ination Department .
the new hardware and software environment forced us to review the traditional organisation and system of the statistical process .
our basic finding and decision was that the statistical activity has to be organised and planned by the tasks , the data collections instead of main functions .
it means that statistical production process will be scheduled and monitored from the beginning ( data collection ) as far as the final phase ( the different publications ) is .
the H@@ CS@@ O has about 160 data collections defined in the ND@@ CP , and for all of these 160 procedures has to be worked out and coordinated the previously separated statistical functions .
naturally it will exploit the advantages of the stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed software tools ( Windows , Lotus 123 , Win@@ word , Oracle , SAS , SP@@ SS ) , the opportunities of the local and regional network .
some important changes should be made which will impact the stati@@ sti@@ cians ' work .
first of all there is a must to write and implement some stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed data capture programs taking into consideration the Oracle tools , instead of the more than 100 unique programs .
it is essential to define the data base management concept where we have to ensure the protection of the individual data and the open access to all publicly interested , aggregate information .
it has to be considered as a distributed database where the access of the individual data is restricted and regulated within the Office too .
there were made some important changes in the field of dissemination .
on the base of the new techniques we created the Publishing section which has the responsibility to define the forms and standards of the publications and to take over step by step the editorial activity from the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments .
on the other hand we will re@@ organise our public Vide@@ o@@ tex system , which means that the structure of frames should be substituted for a PC database preserving the easy handling of the information .
as it was mentioned already we had more than two decades practice and experiences with the IBM main@@ frame and terminal system .
all of the applications and databases were organised in that environment , so the change to the open HP system requires the migration of these .
for the further development a detailed study has been completed on the subject of migration from the earlier IBM and T@@ PA environment onto the newly acquired HP facilities .
the study focused on the full scope of migration with the following emphasis :
- information and H@@ CS@@ O organisation issues ,
- tasks and sub @@@ -@@ @ tasks to be undertaken ,
- in@@ house and external technical assistance requirements ,
the migration practically has three different parts .
one is the migration of the databases which means the systematic overview of about 6000 databases by the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments .
as a result of@@ that there is necessary to make the decision by databases whether it has to access online or it is enough to have on the back off @@@ -@@ @ line .
the second part is the migration of the application systems , which means the transformation of the programs where the application can be used more or less on the new platform .
the consequence of@@ that is the need to analyse the 160 applications one by one .
the third part is the problem of the newly developed applications , where we have to solve these tasks in the new environment .
generally the migration has a resource and a time element .
the resource has to be taken into consideration first of all as the internal capacity of the Office .
this is a very important conclusion of ours that the migration can be solved basically only by ourselves , experts from outside could help in some details but not in the task as a whole .
the time of the migration depends on this internal capacity in such circumstances when the regular activity is carried out by the same people .
in that context we have to make the priorities among the problems and to find the elements of the migration which can be solved by outside experts .
for that purpose we have to find the financial sources too , taken into consideration that the parallel running of the two systems occurs extra costs also .

I was struck by some of the comments made by Mr N@@ asi@@ rov from Uzbekistan yesterday .
useful information should be supplied to enterprises from , and for whom , statistics are collected .
they need feedback so that they can understand their markets and the rest of the economy .
generally , providing quantitative measures of society , will help economic and cultural development .
although the technology is now mature , it has to be updated continuously .

it is the regional dimension .
the statistical system and its technology must adapt to political possibilities and organisation .
identical computer systems have to be installed in 10 , 20 or more regions .
ensuring technological uniformity across the regions is very difficult .
we , w@@ ester@@ ners , were concerned with decentralized control , meaning making users responsible for their own computing systems .

often , businesses chosen for the sample no longer exist when regional staff visit the address .
in this way , the office will have the same statistical figures as those in the tax declarations . the cost has yet to be established .

data collection accounts for a large share of expenditure ; it includes telephone calls and visits to respondents .
a new monthly retail trade survey was introduced with the aid of the Canad@@ ians . the basic idea was to introduce a combination of a list and an area framework .

any such program would have to be sent to headquarters for testing and quality evaluation .
if it is judged useful , the program could be distributed nationwide .
but this is technically not possible at present .
we need an efficient server for distributing tested programs to regional offices through a network .

as Mr K@@ ö@@ ni@@ g said , there is no ideal organisation .
the best one is that which fits current requirements ; it is not static and changes over time .
the first step is the formulation of a statistical strategy from which business priorities for developing information systems are derived .
a systems architecture has to be developed and co@@ sted for this purpose .
planners do not know whether there is enough capital when they start the process .
as time goes by , planners have re @@@ -@@ @ cycle through the same processes .
development is a continuous process of evolution and re @@@ -@@ @ planning .
it used to be possible in the western countries to plan for 7 @@@ -@@ @ 10 years .
but technology development and the need for greater flexibility to respond to rapid changes in the economy have changed the situation .
thus , there is a sort of time @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ market issue dealing with our strategies .
in the United Kingdom , strategies are read@@ ju@@ sted every year and new ones are developed every 34 years .
they should include statistical sections of departments which use computer systems for processing surveys .
users should guide developments by setting priorities and defining the systems .
dialogue and feedback should be encouraged .
now users are more computer @@@ -@@ @ liter@@ ate and work closely with computing departments .
a good and strong working relationship should be established between the president of the statistical office and the head of the computing unit .
making users project managers may appear too advanced in the eastern European context , but this issue will emerge in 35 years .
however users should be involved in the design and testing of prototypes now .
some comparisons will give an idea of the cost of developing statistics .
the total gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the United Kingdom is about USD 800 billion . the cost of the British statistical
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS service is about USD 230 million , which is 0.@@ 02 % of GDP .
the cost of the CS@@ O alone , which is about 30 % of that , is USD 65 million .
the CS@@ O information systems budget amounts to USD 15 million , roughly 22 % of the total CS@@ O expenditure .
we have about 3000 indicators for national accounts .
for the balance of payments , which includes foreign trade aggre@@ gates , we have about 500 indicators .
the retail price index has identified 600 items for measuring inflation .
the total number of macro @@@ -@@ @ economic time @@@ -@@ @ series is about 15 000 .
the type of architecture to be adopted for the new systems has been debated .
the work can be distributed between the two systems and they can be connected together .
at the CS@@ O , we continue using min@@ ic@@ om@@ put@@ ers because the business register of companies alone occupies over 10 gi@@ gab@@ ytes now and will increase to nearly 20 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
CS@@ O has proved that UN@@ L@@ X min@@ ic@@ om@@ put@@ ers can run such databases . a personal computer does not have such capacity and C@@ AN@@ NOT offer it to 100 users .
we use ing@@ ress , the relational database run on UN@@ L@@ X .
integration is a key factor because running two systems separately , MS @@@ -@@ @ DOS Ab@@ d UNIX , is difficult and expensive .
in the future , Windows MT software may be capable of running the whole application .
it will be server and client . very large central servers will still be needed , .
the architecture is a Master Plan ensuring that the most important facilities are there , making sure that amendments will fit in .
but you should be prepared to change the architecture whenever it is needed , either for technical reasons or in order to meet changing needs .
the architecture should be deduc@@ ted from analysis of the needs of the statistics production .
one question that has to be addressed in the plan is that of vendor dependence .
we should be aware that a lot of errors exist in the pc software , even from the most well @@@ -@@ @ established vendors .
in this respect , the quality is far from the level known by many of us from the main@@ frame world .
still , we must beware of monopolies and avoid to become too dependent on one single vendor .
there is no questioning that the architecture should be based on standards .
the Commission has for many good reasons given great importance to de j@@ ure standards .
but it is a problem that these standards have often not been fully implemented in products on the market .
even they have been introduced , it is often possible to find better products that are based on de facto standards .
you must find out what is going to work in practice .
my next point concerns the necessity of stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation of tools within our offices .
job mobility will be hampered because stati@@ sti@@ cians will have to be trained in new tools if they move to another branch of statistics .
I sincerely believe that we should adopt a policy of everybody using the same tool for the same task .
L@@ N this way we may minimise the efforts necessary for training the users and supporting different software products .
but who is to choose the tools ?
people with technical expertise or the users ?
my advice is to recognise that acceptance from the users is essential .
for this reason we must let the users decide .
we must be aware that computer departments are often seen by stati@@ sti@@ cians as the enemy .
even the best choice is wrong if it is imposed upon the users .
still we must keep up stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation , meaning that the users should be represented in a committee that chooses a very few tools to be used .
for instance , everybody uses the same spreadsheet .
in my office we have eliminated the Computer Department , decentr@@ al@@ ising the applications development to the statistical branches .
a large number of programmers were distributed among the subject matter units .
of course there are still a number of central functions to be carried out : systems management , including software and hardware management , systems programming , and user support .

providing complete information on suitable media
to supply as wide a range of statistical information as possible to all the users outside the Commission is one of Euro@@ stat 's main roles .
this type o@@ fin@@ formation is published in documents entitled " publications " under the responsibility of the Commission .
these Euro@@ stat publications are merely the visible and public part of Euro@@ stat 's work , which is geared to the Commission 's working priorities .
to be really accessible to everyone , they must be described , presented and accompanied by a commentary .
the dr@@ y@@ ness of statistics and their reputation for technical complexity mean that they have to be " brought " to the user and that any reluctance to use them has to be overcome .
( how to use statistics to improve understanding of the other information supplied by the Commission ? ) c )
in this way the networks will greatly ease the task of dissemination .
product creation and external communication create a context favourable to dissemination
Euro@@ stat is a producer of information .
it obt@@ ains its raw materials from the Member States , where all the public bodies concerned by a Community policy send their data to Euro@@ stat .
these bodies are the National Statistical In@@ stitutes ( N@@ S@@ Is ) , the central banks , certain ministries ( agriculture , industry etc . ) , chambers of trade and industry etc .
each of Euro@@ stat 's author direc@@ torates is in contact with the national body or bodies whose data it deals with .
the national sources send the information on paper , on magnetic medium or electronically .
until the beginning of the 1990s , all the information received was processed and then stored in clearly defined environments : C@@ RO@@ N@@ OS , regi@@ o AND CO@@ ME@@ XT .
the rapid increase in the power of PCs and database managers has accent@@ u@@ ated this trend .
at the same time , some authors have gradually dis@@ continued input to the C@@ RO@@ N@@ OS environment .
the general publications take their material from both sources , while the thematic publications and statistical documents derive their material directly from the producers ' databases .

direc@@ torates Β to F
the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit is not the commercial department of Euro@@ stat .
dissemination means the organization of the procedures for transforming information .
the first concern of the Unit is to know what has to be disseminated .
its role is to analyse demand and decide what should be the subject of a publication or statistical document .
the purpose here is to make statistical information accessible to users in as simple and user @@@ -@@ @ friendly a way as possible .
this work concerns the form in which information is presented .
the authors create the statistical documents , which are , as it were , semi @@@ -@@ @ finished products that are sometimes difficult for a non @@@ -@@ @ specialist to use directly .
for example , publications must be in three or nine Community languages , while statistical documents must be translated into the three working languages .
when a product is ready for publishing , the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit is responsible for coordination between the authors and the Pub@@ l@@ ications Office .
upstream it coordinates the stages of the publishing process by assisting the authors .
it answers any questions they may have on how to create a publication : what the various stages and the key factors of success are .
there are two possible cases .
when the manuscript is a statistical document , the Unit 's role is confined to supervis@@ ing the transmission of the document .
once the publications have left the printer 's , the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit plays little part in their distribution .
the relevant legislation stipulates that only the Pub@@ l@@ ications Office is entitled to distribute and sell publications of the European institutions , ( see the attached Decision of 16 January 1969 ) .

they do not describe how the product itself originates .
upstream of this process , the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit has a role which will be described in the next part , " Product creation . "
the information system developed by Euro@@ stat is intended to provide a basis for drawing up , monitoring and assessing Community policies .
these services are naturally provided free of charge .
this document may be nothing more than a database or simple file .
Euro@@ stat considers that this type of document , which has a clearly defined objective , may possibly be of interest to persons outside the Commission , such as the Commission 's partners , national authorities , the relevant professional groups , experts etc .
the institutions and privileged users mainly " consume " technical and exhaus@@ tive statistical documents dealing with particular subjects .
statistical documents use a common language laid down as part of the European Statistical System ( ess ) .
these products are disseminated in three ways :
the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit manages the privileged user files , which enable it to send those concerned the standard Euro@@ stat products as soon as they appear ( statistical documents and periodicals ) .
the European institutions and privileged users are informed of what statistical documents and publications are available by means of an annual catalogue and a monthly bulletin ( Just published ) .
the promotional role of the Unit stops there , after which it is up to the interested institutions to apply for such documents .
the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit helps Euro@@ stat in the performance of one of its tasks : to inform the people of Europe .
if the process of dissemination to the end customer is carefully tracked , it can be seen that there is almost always an intermediary between Euro@@ stat and the end user .
these intermediaries are all information @@@ -@@ @ distributing bodies ( documentation centres , libraries , educational bodies ) operating either within an organization or on the information market .
how are products disseminated to the general public ?
ad hoc products are disseminated to the general public via the information offices .
they are produced on request , as explained above .
the Dis@@ sem@@ ination Unit is thus fully in charge of their production and sale .
it also controls the sale of electronic products , since it is responsible for looking for the servers and brokers who buy the electronic products and the right to re@@ distribute them .
it prepares and organizes the negotiation of all contracts on behalf of the Pub@@ l@@ ications Office .
Jean H@@ eller , HE@@ AD OF SEC@@ TO@@ R , AP@@ PL@@ IC@@ ATION DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P@@ MENT , EURO@@ ST@@ AT ,
information systems should be made to fit the organisation of the enterprise and not the reverse .
this must be the primary aim of the re@@ organisation plan to be defined .
a number of unavoidable constraints can already be listed
this can be achieved by identifying the objectives , harmon@@ ising die statistical procedures and concepts , developing methods , providing standards and identifying levels of involvement .
the " Master Plan " can act as the supporting tool for this phase .
the expected results can be broken down as follows :
- a definition of the different areas of the information system with their architecture ,
- a development plan for each area ,
the following will be determined during this stage :
- the strategy for staff resources ( training , sub @@@ -@@ @ contracting )
- the strategy for hardware resources ( down@@ sizing , right@@ sizing )
- the strategy on software matters ( micro@@ s , DB@@ MS@@ s , Case tools )
as such , its main objective is to give a measure of the effort required to complete the process :
- in relation to the existing situation ,
- establishing the timing of application development ,
given these different objectives , the conception of the information system is bound by two contradictory constraints :
- a modular approach to development : the applications must be developed on a step by step basis for reasons of cost and control ,
- an overall approach to development in order to minimise the overlap between applications .
to carry out such an operation successfully , it must be possible to integrate a large number of parameters such as :
- the need to define within each stage the actions to be carried out and their inter@@ connection , the role and responsibilities of each part of the project group and above all the expected results .
everyone has dreamed of being able , one day , to start with a clean sheet and re @@@ -@@ @ do everything from the beginning .
it is , however , only a dream .
in statistical institutes , the tendency is generally towards limitation of the size o@@ fin@@ formation systems , in other words towards the decentr@@ alisation of processing power and in the direction of client / server architectures with access via workstations connected to the networks .
in past years , some enterprises have played the " down@@ sizing " card , favour@@ ing the processing of information by decentr@@ alised and personal systems .
today , with enterprises concerned to preserve their investments , and thanks to the client / server concept , there has been a jud@@ icious movement towards " right@@ sizing . "
in the past the price of equipment , and particularly that of PCs , has fallen considerably ( from $ 250,000 to $ 2,500 in ten years ) .
in parallel , the power of micro @@@ -@@ @ processors has virtually doubled every eight months .
at the technical level , the phenomenon has been has been greatly slowed down by the lack of software and tools for the crucial applications and by the problems of security and back @@@ -@@ @ up .
Me@@ an@@ w@@ ile at the human level , the difficulty of finding network specialists has been holding back the trend .
it is interesting to look at the statistical systems most commonly used in Euro@@ stat .
these systems originated mostly in the main@@ frame world and are increasingly available on UNIX machines or powerful PCs .
the fame database allows the storage of a large number of different OB@@ J@@ EC@@ TS , with a manipulation language which has a wide range of facilities for the treatment of time .
it includes a programming language which supports the functions of a GUI ( Graph@@ ical User Interface ) .
it is possible to use it as a production database manager for time series or as a diffusion database server ; it is available only on a UNIX platform .
it deals with the time dimension , but in a less sophisticated way than the time series systems .
its graphical capabilities are limited in the main@@ frame versions . it is available on Main@@ frame platforms , UNIX and PC Windows , with more or less processing capacity .
the SAS product , well known for its statistical potential , has evolved into a development tool .
it has retained a very well stoc@@ ked library of statistical and econom@@ etric functions ; its graphical capabilities include 3D graphics , carto@@ graphy and a graphics editor .
it can be considered as an integrated environment for the analysis and presentation of data which offers powerful development tools .
the structure of its database , which resembles relational databases , is not very suitable for the manipulation of time series .
each system has to be supplied to the user with an extra layer of programs allowing the attachment of specific functions for the integration of metadata .
case is an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m meaning :
C for " computer "
the C@@ ASE tool is defined as the combination of a graphics interface , dictionary , generator , project management and other tools which aid the developers in the construction and maintenance of high quality systems , all within the framework of a structured methodology .
the concept of the dictionary ( repository ) as a means of centr@@ al@@ ising all definitions promotes re @@@ -@@ @ use both of working methods and of documentation .
to achieve a high level of success with the implementation of a C@@ ASE tool , it must be viewed and selected as a management tool and not as a technical tool .
another key factor in the introduction of a C@@ ASE tool is the putting in place of a systematic training policy for users as well as developers .
these tools facilitate mobility between projects by providing a common inform@@ atics and organisational culture .
it is imperative to take control of application developments which represent an increasingly significant proportion of current inform@@ atics costs ( see right@@ sizing ) .
traditionally , inform@@ ati@@ cians use two kinds of management tool : the Master Plan and development Meth@@ od@@ ologies .
for most professional inform@@ ati@@ cians these are the obvious tools and meet the requirements perfectly .
the message from this is simple : the objective is to save money and avoid costly mis@@ haps .
a study of enterprises which really manage inform@@ atics projects shows that the technique relies on four different aspects :
those applications which have the best chance of success must be chosen from the mass of those that are possible .
it is therefore usual to eliminate those which are too risky , as well as those which are not viable .
steering the project : whatever the nature of the project ( development of a new diffusion product or introduction of new statistics ) it must be ste@@ ered .
there are many ways of directing a project ; some tend towards particip@@ ative direction , others prefer a more command oriented approach .
the forms of project direction vary but the aims are always the same .
Roger C@@ UB@@ IT@@ T , HE@@ AD OF UN@@ IT , D@@ AT@@ AB@@ AS@@ ES AND publications MAN@@ AG@@ EMENT ,
the potential impact of these trends on Statistical Information Systems is discussed .
finally , no references are cited in this document .
the DE@@ M@@ AND FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL IN@@ FOR@@ M@@ ATION
the 21st century has already been dubbed " the beginning of the Information Age " in a number of articles in popular journals .
one of the primary trends in economic and statistical information which is already visible is the move from a " data " concept to an " information " concept .
by this is meant the requirement not only to provide the numbers but to attach some indication of what they mean and how they can be used ( or not ! ) .
there are a number of reasons for this . official statistics , are experiencing a continuous expansion .
this expansion takes three separate forms which compound to give an
the call for more and better structured information on environmental issues is heard everywhere .
the pragmatic route is more frequent and generally more rapid .
the process of stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation of definitions is thus very similar in many respects to any other International standards process .
whilst covering metadata , a brief mention should be made of Ge@@ ographical Information Systems ( GIS ) in relation to statistical information .
these same computers also foster a variety of packages for analysis which have different capabilities and strengths even if there is considerable overlap .
some tools to provide this facility are already appearing on the market .
in the area of application driven technology , one must also mention the arrival on the market of high capacity optical storage devices and the software products that accompany them .
a final significant major trend has nothing to do with statistics per se but is already having an impact on S@@ IS is Statistical Confi@@ denti@@ ality .
most democratic countries have laws defining the rules of confidentiality for individual data provided to government and company administrations .
certainly in Europe we have seen a rapid development of legislation in this field .
thus we find the beginnings of an unwillingness or sometimes inability to provide data across administrative boundaries without some guarantees ( not to mention penalties ) being provided for .
this impacts on the collection of@@ statistical information in 3 ways :
as described earlier , statistical data requirements are becoming more detailed both in classification and geographic terms .
logically this makes it more and more easy to identify individual respondents .
this may be contrary to the conditions under which the collecting agency is given the data in the first place .
provision of pre @@@ -@@ @ aggregated summary data to a statistical agency becomes very rapidly an impedi@@ ment to the usage of the data .
new en@@ qui@@ ries may require tab@@ ulations which are impossible from pre @@@ -@@ @ determined partial aggre@@ gations even though these may be fully compatible with the coverage of the detailed data available .
the question here is what effect are these v@@ ectors of change going to have on the Statistical in@@ formations Systems ?
the question need . ; to be answered both in functional and strategic terms . by this is meant both what is needed and how it will be implemented .
object orient@@ ated Systems are off the drawing board and emerging out of the prototype phase .
a lot of consolidation of existing academic work into operational systems is still needed and the academic and research work evidently still has further to go .
in the background , there are some interesting ideas around in Expert Systems where there is even a specific EC programme in Expert Systems for Statistics ( doses ) .
another domain which generates food for thought is " Hyper@@ text " although how this could be applied in general in a S@@ IS environment is not completely clear .
certainly for text descrip@@ tor based retrieval it presents some interesting possibilities .
as the power of the tools evol@@ ves , so such adaptation will become easier and more transparent .
it is the increasing power of these PC 's which is enabling us to hide more and more of the complexity of the pat@@ ch@@ work behind .
menu driven service selection , automated routing and remote login and client @@@ -@@ @ server facilities are just a few of the techniques .
a significant g@@ lim@@ mer in the dark however , has already been grasped by Euro@@ stat which is trying to focus and intensify the beam .
the ED@@ IF@@ ACT main thrust is in the area of data transmission over networks , but the structures can easily be applied to magnetic support as well .
once messages con@@ forming to ED@@ IF@@ ACT standards start to be used , the feasibility of using abstr@@ acts or aggre@@ gates of the data directly in the statistical collection process , increases significantly .
one final application area problem which is of particular interest to Euro@@ stat for obvious reasons , is that of multi @@@ -@@ @ lingu@@ alism .
this topic always elic@@ its w@@ ry smiles from colleagues from the USA , although not necessarily from those further to the north of the American continent in Canada .
in a world wide context , such as that envisaged in UN @@@ -@@ @ ED@@ IF@@ ACT , it is clear that no @@@ -@@ @ one is immune to this problem .
to pass on to the more strategic aspects , it is clear that the network aspects have to be integrated into the S@@ IS architecture .
data is collected by sector , the sector definitions being mainly them@@ atically targeted .
products may be sec@@ t@@ orial but there are a wide range of product possibilities which require input from a variety of@@ statistical sectors .
this mis@@ match miti@@ gates for some sort of central inform@@ atics infrastructure to enable the products to be derived from a variety of sources .
other components which reinforce these are the security and harmon@@ isation aspects which are much more difficult to implement in a fully distributed environment .
the picture is then one of a decentr@@ alisation of the S@@ IS functions linked to the evolution of basic nom@@ encl@@ ature and other metadata availability .
the time @@@ -@@ @ frame , however , is to be measured in decades !
it would be an under statement to say that things are moving in Europe .
Euro@@ stat has for sometime been developing a proposal for its future structure to try to face these challenges .
in a nut@@ shell , Euro@@ stat is working towards the creation of a fully fledged European Statistical System .
to achieve this , Euro@@ stat will need to examine not only its own internal organisation but also the accompanying Information Systems Architecture ( ISA ) that will be required .
the main outline of such an architecture have now been established and the precise functional specification is being refined .
the former systems are essentially concerned with the reception , validation , and harmon@@ isation of incoming data and then the creation of " derived " variables or indicators ( European totals for example ) .
the reasons for this original separation are many .
we had also found that users were complaining about the variety of different access methods being proposed ; each sector had developed its own products with their own style .
it can be fairly readily seen that the architecture proposed can be organised in a way which simplifies the development of solutions to a great number of problems .
it is this " organisation " of the architecture which is currently being fin@@ alised .
" reference " consists of at least the catalogue and ideally , data storage capability .
the catalogue contains a description in a norm@@ alised form of the data that Euro@@ stat has available , its characteristics , its source and its usage .
obviously , the data C@@ AN@@ NOT be described at the level of detail of the individual indicator due to the enormous workload this would require .
in terms of generic function of the " reference " layer , it can be lik@@ ened to a warehouse where data is grouped on " pal@@ lets " which are delivered from production .
the " pal@@ lets " contain a description of what they contain and a resum@@ é of this is stored in a catalogue of warehouse contents .

as the European Economic Area opens up , demands are increasing for a broader resource of reliable information to support decision making on issues such as social , financial and economical .
within the statistics community , the emerging requirement is for easier collection and dissemination of statistics between economic operators , Regional or National Administr@@ ations , European Institutions and end users .

- ED@@ IC@@ OM ( Electronic Data Inter@@ change in Commerce )
- In@@ corporation of statistical activities in the Fourth Framework Research Programme as an extension of work carried out previously in the doses programme .
statistical authorities are being continually encouraged to provide faster , more accurate and more detailed statistics so that political , socio @@@ -@@ @ economic and even commercial decisions can be based on more reliable information .
the problem facing statistical authorities is that the collection of this information is costly and time @@@ -@@ @ consuming for the economic operators supplying the raw statistical data .
the economic operators must restructure their data into the classifications systems used by stati@@ sti@@ cians and they wish to do this in a way that is as efficient as the processes they use to run their own business .
on the other hand , the data we need for statistical purposes can be derived from or conveyed by E@@ DI messages , if statistical needs are taken into account in the various commercial sectors where E@@ DI flows and the related messages are being designed .
this concerns not only the existence , but also the structuring and coding of the information to be inter@@ changed .
the information to be collected for statistical purposes must always be present in the information systems of the economic operators involved in E@@ DI . in other words , the sources must never dry up .
the more advanced the user groups ' planning of their E@@ DI applications , the harder it will be to take statistical requirements into account .
investments in the design of messages that have already been standardized C@@ AN@@ NOT be simply written off , and requests for modification at that stage are unlikely to be favour@@ ably received .
one aspect of this cooperation is to give back to the economic operators aggregated statistics in the domain in which they operate .
this information can then be used in their deci@@ sion@@ making processes .
and if the submission of data is mandatory , E@@ DI standards can be embodied in the regulatory framework thus ensuring a consistent way of receiving information electronically .
this has been the case with the EC IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT regulation , where the E@@ DI message C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT@@ 17@@ is the specified standard .
in addition to that , stati@@ sti@@ cians need to design their own E@@ DI messages both for collection and dissemination of@@ statistical information .

- In@@ corporation of statistical activities in the Fourth Framework Research Programme as an extension of work carried out previously in the doses " programme
DS@@ IS is a framework for a wide range of activities in the statistical community .
some exist already , some are enhancements , and some are new .
the aim of DS@@ IS is to establish a framework enabling all operators and users in the field of statistical information to cooperate more closely , at all levels .
without this framework , a very large number of projects relating to telem@@ atics Networks , both public and private , both European and in a larger geographical context , will inevitably advance without adequate coordination and cross @@@ -@@ @ fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation .
the establishment of the DS@@ IS framework follows a Fe@@ a@@ sibility Study launched in ' 92 involving Euro@@ stat , the EU ^ member states and EF@@ TA countries .
a set of 52 initial tasks were identified on issues such as :
- Har@@ mon@@ ization of data collection
- Security of statistical information
- Use of file transfer
- Telecommunications support
- Inform@@ atics standards
work underway consists in elabor@@ ating a detailed DS@@ IS Work programme , a first set of actions will be launched in ' 94 as part of ID@@ A sec@@ t@@ orial activities .
- definition and initial implementation of a harmon@@ ised structure for reference information datas@@ ets ( Reference Environment )
- definition and integration of E@@ DI messages , these E@@ DI messages will be based on ISO standards such
- definition and integration of an electronic messaging network ( DS@@ IS Log@@ ical Network ) between organisations
- findings on improved data collection techniques and tools .
in the context of communications , the first work programme aims to introduce a basic telecommunications network between organisations , to which services can be added .
the main benefits of a network arise from using the value @@@ -@@ @ added services , such as application @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ application file transfer , routing and control mechanisms for file transfer .
this activity will benefit from the ST@@ AT@@ EL@@ 2 ° project .
ST@@ AT@@ EL - Application to Application protocol independent from Data Communication Services
the ST@@ AT@@ EL project started under the umbrella of the former CA@@ DD@@ IA@@ 2
ST@@ AT@@ EL seeks to draw the line between the end@@ user application and the telecommunications protocols or the Data Communication Services .
to meet this need , ST@@ AT@@ EL is divided into two distinct parts : the ST@@ AT@@ EL @@@ -@@ @ Application Program@@ ming Interface ( ST@@ AT@@ EL @@@ -@@ @ API ) and the ST@@ AT@@ EL protocol specific Transfer Mod@@ ules ( ST@@ AT@@ EL @@@ -@@ @ TM ) .
the ST@@ AT@@ EL @@@ -@@ @ API has been designed to provide an interface that is intuitive for application developers ( C language ) used to the Unix or DOS operating systems .
for each supported protocol , one ST@@ AT@@ EL @@@ -@@ @ Transfer Module will need to exist .
currently ST@@ AT@@ EL supports the following :
- Operating Systems : UNIX ( V.@@ 3 , V.@@ 4 , SCO , S@@ UN / OS ) and DOS ( 5 or higher )
- Telecommunications protocols : ker@@ mit u@@ uc@@ p
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
the ST@@ AT@@ EL layer is used in software developed by the statistical authorities such as ST@@ AD@@ I@@ UM , PC @@@ -@@ @ S@@ IM@@ PL@@ E , ED@@ IN@@ O@@ ME@@ N , ID@@ EP .
other administrations are considering the use of ST@@ AT@@ EL for their own developments .
the objective of Ser@@ t is to increase the competi@@ tivity of the European enterprises by reducing their administrative workload and by supplying them with better and more relevant business statistics .
the tools to achieve this is the combination of automated data collection techniques , to capture at a lower cost to the enterprises better business figures , and the integration of a business statistics environment within the overall " information administrative system " of the enterprise .
the statistics questionnaires constitute a paradigm of the generic declar@@ ative process .
the objective is to study , in the various countries of the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , the state of the art in the area of automated data collection in general , and particularly in electronic questionnaire .
the integration of these techniques in the general data processing flow of the enterprise is of particular relevance as the overall aim is to reduce the administrative workload of the enterprises .
the ED@@ IC@@ OM project started in 1990 under the umbrella of the former CA@@ DD@@ IA programme .
the implementation of the internal market on 01 January 1993 removed technical , administrative and fiscal obstacles from the internal borders between the Member States of the European Community .
the disappearance of customs form@@ alities meant giving up the old system of data collection through the Single Administrative Document ( SA@@ D ) .
taking into account the necessity for statistics on intra @@@ -@@ @ Community goods movements , a new collection system , called IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT , was set up .
more than a million of Provider of Statistical Information ( P@@ SI ) are concerned at EU level .
statistical information on these movements has since January 1993 been collected direct from the companies .
these latter send a monthly statistical declaration to the relevant administration in each Member State .
one of the essential characteristics of the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT system is its link to the tax system , as can be seen from the following .
this administration supplies the statistical bodies with intra @@@ -@@ @ Community dispatch and arrival figures broken down by trader , enabling comparison with the amounts shown in the statistical declaration .
in this way the Member States are able to carry out checks fro completeness and accuracy .
ED@@ IC@@ OM projects
the preparations for the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT statistical system offered an ideal opportunity for experimentation .
the conclusion of this survey was that the infrastructure at the company 's level was suitable for the implementation of broad electronic data processing .
for that reason , a project plan was designed with sub projects :
- promotion and information campaign for all parties involved ,
- hardware and software provision for the responsible National Authorities in order to process electronic returns
in the framework of the promotion and information campaign , several initiatives were taken .
the main objective was to raise the awareness of the future providers of the statistical IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT returns ( Provider of Statistical Information - P@@ SI ) and to provide them with optimal information for the implementation of the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT Regulation in the administrative practice .
various products were developed , such as a logo , brochures , technical documents and a video .
the Commission also supported the free distribution of the Combined N@@ omen@@ cl@@ ature .
new initiatives will be communicated concerning the promotion and the distribution of E@@ DI instruments .
special software were developed for the compos@@ ing of the returns by the P@@ SI 's .
the package got the name : ID@@ EP / CN@@ 8 ( In@@ tr@@ ast@@ at Data En@@ try Package / Combined N@@ omen@@ cl@@ ature 8 digits ) .
similar initiatives have been undertaken by other Member States , for example the Netherlands with the IR@@ IS package and the Portugal .
the main functionality of ID@@ EP / CN@@ 8 is of course data entry , including validity checks , of the elements of the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT returns .
the package can also be used to import , correct and translate to the official format ( UN / ED@@ IF@@ ACT message C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT ) the data from existing administrative company sources .
various helpful facilities ( consultation of lists , default values and calculation formulas ) are provided .
amongst these the consultation and selection of the Combined N@@ omen@@ cl@@ ature .
the software has been distributed within the EU under the responsibility of the N@@ CA .
in 1994 , it is planned to extend the dissemination of the package in the Member States and to incorporate the telecommunication layer , in particular through ST@@ AT@@ EL .
the official IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT return must be in accordance with the standard UN / ED@@ IF@@ ACT message C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT .
this is a standard developed by one of the message development groups of the Western European UN / ED@@ IF@@ ACT Board : we / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 Statistics .
the message C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT is derived from the C@@ US@@ D@@ EC message : the electronic message for the Single Administrative Document , the customs document in use for trade with Third Countries .
the advantage of the use of this standard is that it meets the growing practice in the field of Commerce to introduce E@@ DI applications based on UN / ED@@ IF@@ ACT messages .
a C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT user guide was published by the Pub@@ l@@ ication Office of the EU .
for that reason potential users must contact the CN@@ A before preparing implementation .
disk / FA@@ X@@ project
the start of the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT system led to the need for a substantial new approach to statistical processing .
within the framework of ED@@ IC@@ OM , the Commission gave technical support by providing software and hardware for the handling of the returns : disk / FA@@ X project .
an extensive training was also provided .
the CD @@@ -@@ @ ROM CO@@ ME@@ XT / IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT is containing time series of detailed foreign trade data of all Member States plus the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT figures .
information technologies for statistics
the objective is to promote research activities necessary for the development of common policies in fields related to basic economic and social requirements .
research topics will include :
- multimedia technologies ,
- distributed architectures
- automated data capture
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
the main motivation for an information base of environmental policies is the need to enrich the available information with respect to socio @@@ -@@ @ economic driving forces of stress on the environment and on natural resources .
this stands out as a priority from the Fifth Environmental Action Programme of the Commission .
research topics will include :
Euro@@ stat and the National Statistical Administr@@ ations need to be closely involved on these activities which will contribute to improve their efficiency .
this control is a prerequisite to ensure the adequacy of the research activities with the user requirements , moreover their compatibility with the current activities to develop the European statistical information system .
it is not surprising , therefore , that the mandate and organisation of W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 are directly related to the support of the two main areas of modernisation of@@ statistical systems :
- the mechanisms of collection and dissemination of@@ statistical information ;
- the inter@@ linking of statistical systems .
the main objectives of the W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 group are :
- to assume responsibility for the process of standardization of@@ statistical messages ;
- to ensure that statistical requirements are taken into consideration in the work carried out by the • other message development groups
in order to carry out its tasks , W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 li@@ a@@ ises with other message development groups both in Western Europe and with similar groups in the other UN / ED@@ IF@@ ACT regions .
we / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 has set up 6 sub @@@ -@@ @ groups , each with its own " Conven@@ er . "
the Chairman has the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the various Working Groups ( WG ) . he is assisted by 2 vice @@@ -@@ @ Cha@@ irs and a secretariat .
the national representatives are nominated by the National Statistical In@@ stitutes and must be endorsed by the national representative to UN / ECE W@@ P@@ 4 .
chair and vice @@@ -@@ @ chairs are elected by the national representatives .
nomination of conven@@ ers is ratified by national representatives , chair and vice @@@ -@@ @ chairs after proposal from the Working Groups .
for the latest list of W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 officers and national representatives ( see MD@@ 6 fac@@ t@@ sheet ) .
the participants of Working Groups are very often coming from the statistical working groups or committees organized at EU level under the secretariat of Euro@@ stat .
participation to any of the ( existing or new ) Working Groups comprises representatives from all the types of organisation concerned ( eg@@ . statistical authorities , economic operators etc . )
the duration of W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 meetings is usually of 2 days .
the Working Groups have working sessions for 1 1 / 2 day before the plenary .

during these last 2 years , W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 has proved its creativity and its dynamism in tackling many activities and achieving quite tangible results :

since Spring 93 , quite a few pilot projects are being implemented in order to test and validate W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 messages :
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS the BO@@ P@@ XX@@ X messages are being tested in the Netherlands , France , Finland and at Euro@@ stat ;
presently , about 8,000 IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT declarations are sent monthly via C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT .
- The message implementation guidelines ( MI@@ G ) have been finalized for C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT , GE@@ SM@@ ES , GE@@ SM@@ ES / PRO@@ D@@ COM , GE@@ SM@@ ES / ST@@ AT@@ EM , BO@@ PD@@ IR and BO@@ PC@@ US .
the M@@ IG@@ s for BO@@ P@@ ST@@ A and BO@@ P@@ IN@@ F will be ready soon .
information Security can be defined as protecting information systems against the threats that affect their Confi@@ denti@@ ality , Integr@@ ity or Avail@@ ability .
confidentiality means that only authorised people can access the data .
in many domains , confidentiality of individual data is a legal or contractual obligation and confidentiality leaks can cause serious problems with the data suppliers .
unauthorised access to statistical results before their official release may also be very dangerous .
integrity means to protect the data against intentional and un@@ intentional falsi@@ fication .
availability means the possibility for the user to access and treat the data whenever needed .
security threats are of various nature and can be grouped into three categories :
human errors include installation errors , use of incompatible programs , delete by mistake , use of wrong programs or data , etc .
again , adequate precautions can minimise , but not eliminate the risks .
deliberate threats include hacking , theft of equipment or information , viruses , software copyright violation , and sabotage .
security experts assume that they will rapidly increase in number in the near future , due to the au@@ g@@ mention of social problems such as unemployment , and of organised crime .
on the one hand , statistical offices are relying on information technology as a basic working tool .
on the other hand , new technologies introduce new security risks .
especially network inter@@ connection , which allows to access computers from distant and un@@ controllable locations , and PC
• Definition of rules for the treatment of confidential data and implementation of the necessary technical infrastructure .
confidential data will be treated on dedicated secure machines accessible only by a limited number of persons and from a limited number of especially protected workstations .
outgoing data can only leave the secure environment under the supervision of the official responsible for the data collection .
adequate technical and organisational measures have been put into place to assure that the security rules are respected and their respect can be verified .
Inform@@ atics users have understand the need for information security , be aware of the risks and follow the rules set up by the organisation .
regular reminders are necessary to make sure that security rules are not neglected for reasons of higher performance or simply ind@@ ol@@ ence .
another important further action is the definition of a formal information security policy for Euro@@ stat .
such a document will define the respon@@ s@@ abilities and fix the basic security rules .
session VI
open Do@@ or to Comp@@ uting P@@ ossi@@ bilities
this session includes stops at station for briefing by working stati@@ sti@@ cians and computing professional , demonstrations of hardware and software equipment , and bilateral discussions in the margin of the seminar .
in particular , the following topics were dealt with :
- Euro@@ stat 's geographical information systems
- Euro@@ stat 's departmental machines and services
- Euro@@ stat 's reference databases and tools
session VII
funding of Statistical Comp@@ uting
funding arrangements , by D.@@ R. Ch@@ ander
the Bank 's programs for statistical activities in the countries of the FS@@ U draw upon three sources for funding .
the modest allocations in the administrative budget have been utilized for staff travel , meeting the costs of seminars and workshops , and preparation of statistical materials , including their translation .
the resources available are very limited and are unlikely to increase in the near term , given the budget str@@ ing@@ encies associated with the zero growth administrative budget .
therefore the prospects for maintaining even the current level of activities are in question .
illustr@@ ative of this was the loan to the Ukraine .
similar components , somewhat smaller , were included in the cases of ge@@ or@@ gia and Armenia .
in several instances funds were made available for purchase of small amounts of hardware .
these loans were the principal vehicles for delivery of financial support for technical assistance activities .
no further loans and credits of th@@ si nature are envisages in the near future .
these loans and credits are highly unlikely to involve assistance for statistics , with perhaps one exception .
that exception would be in the case of loans and credits for safety net programs .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
a number of country @@@ -@@ @ specific Trust Fun@@ ds have been established for supporting a variety of activities .
in brief , in the present circumstances there are no prospects of the Bank financing computer hardware requirements of the FS@@ U countries ' statistical services .
Gi@@ or@@ gio BO@@ N@@ AC@@ O , HE@@ AD OF UN@@ IT , TRA@@ IN@@ ING , SO@@ C@@ IAL ST@@ AT@@ EM@@ EN@@ TS AND advice TO governments , EU / T@@ AC@@ IS
I shall talk to you about the T@@ AC@@ IS potentials and limitations as far as funding is concerned .
it started in 1991 with an allocation of 1 billion and 8@@ 70 000 M@@ EC@@ Us .
the programme was very large and restricted at the same time , if compared with the needs of the countries .
this amount was ear@@ marked for the funding of some 2000 projects or activities of different dimensions .
up to present statistics is part of the inter @@@ -@@ @ state programme .
it does not finance investments , nor purchase of equipment or goods .
it is a programme of technical assistance , which means transfer of expertise and know @@@ -@@ @ how .
the partner countries have a crucial role to play in the different stages .
for instance the statistical programme is developed by Euro@@ stat and implemented by CE@@ SD @@@ -@@ @ Commun@@ aut@@ aire .
a legal basis under@@ lies the T@@ AC@@ IS programme which is established at EU level .
the present programme is to come to an end in 1995 .
this is the framework within which the statistical cooperation programme , which was established in 1992 , is being carried out .
we consider this programme important for many reasons known by you all : high quality statistics are needed for political and economic decision making .
we also have a series of activities intended to provide advice and information on specific issues to governments .
therefore project conception has been placed as a priority for the first stage of the T@@ AC@@ IS cooperation programme .
developing an architecture is important for several reasons .
but what are the concrete possibilities offered by T@@ AC@@ IS in terms of provision of technical equipment ?
as I already said , it is a programme which aims at providing services and technical assistance in its various forms .
I think that we are far from being able to meet the request that is emerging from the first stage of the statistical cooperation programme .
T@@ AC@@ IS can make PCs or teaching tools available through an international call for tender .
this is important and brings me back to the open architecture system which makes it possible for international competition to take place .
this is the situation today and until the end of 1995 .
what I note however is a very clear trend to continue to use cooperation tools mainly for technical assistance .
under these circumstances it is essential to make use of syner@@ gy in various institutions at various levels through multilateral and bilateral cooperation to fund various components maxim@@ ising the results .
to improve international cooperation will serve to cut back on dupl@@ ications and maxim@@ alize results .
we support statistics cooperation and agree to keep the programme in place , adjust it , and make it more efficient in the long @@@ -@@ @ term .
before going on to discussions , I would like to make a comment of my own .
without this nothing can be done and you have a key @@@ -@@ @ role to play to ensure that this happens .
on our side we stressed the importance of statistics within the European Commission and made it aware that statistics are essential for you and for us .
A@@ FI@@ R Veli@@ ev , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ ATE ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E , AZ@@ ER@@ B@@ AU@@ AN
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Euro@@ stat for this important seminar which enabled us to receive so much information .
we are at the beginning of the transition stage .
though this assistance , we have to work on three lines : a ) methodology b ) technology c ) training of our staff .
these three components all go together and carry an equal weight .
Un@@ fortun@@ al@@ tely , training and methodology are more advanced if compared with technology .
we need assistance from Euro@@ stat to enable us to prepare the conditions for a market economy and cope with new economic phenomena , such as informal economy .
training courses were very useful , however the are attended by economists and stati@@ sti@@ cians but not technicians and engineers in charge of@@ statistical computing .
technical equipment is the weak point .
I shall conclude repeating that we are at the beginning of the transition process and this process can be shortened with your assistance and the assistance of other international organisations .
Vladimir G@@ OR@@ Y@@ ACH@@ K@@ OV@@ SK@@ II , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ ATE ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E , K@@ AZ@@ AK@@ H@@ ST@@ AN
first of all would like to express our thanks to the international organisation and to inform you of the progress made by Kazakhstan during the last two and a half past year .
the multipl@@ ier training courses organised by Euro@@ stat in Germany enabled our trained staff to become trainers in their turn and to achieve results in our statistical services .
the flow of information necessary for balance of payments was defined .
subsequently IMF helped us to test it and to introduce the necessary corrections to it .
the result is that we already have the balance of payments for the first quarter of this year without having had particular problems .
a similar assistance by OECD in national accounts allowed us to produce aggregate figures .
I hope that Euro@@ stat will also define areas of practical assistance where it will play the role of co ordin@@ ator .
in these areas we would not ask the assistance of other international organisations . we want to avoid dupl@@ ications and to econom@@ ise resources .
a good initiative of Euro@@ stat was the appointing of advisers to our government .
our former structure met the needs of planned economy , the changes underway in the economic structure of our country requires that our tasks are changed accordingly .
when we started our joint work we did not have many plans and the information received helped us to reflect and take decisions . what was achieved is satisfactory .
we also need resources to master the new technology in order to enhance statistics .
we shall change our statistical system in order to set up a new organisation of activities .
if the international organisations are ready to provide us with the same assistance they provided until now in order to create new flows of information , we shall be very grateful .

we are not attending the seminar with the aim of seeking new resources for equipment .
moreover , no amount of financial support would be adequate at present .
taking the example of Russia , if we plan to organize 30 000 posts , regardless of administration costs , this would cost not less than USD 50 million .
the success of our efforts in setting up a good computer system would depend on the interest shown by end users .
if banks and ministries understand that without statistics Russia will not progress very far , statistical offices would obtain effective and efficient assistance from state bodies .
our users should understand the usefulness of statistical information .
the World Bank , the European Commission , and various other international bodies could be mobilized to support our efforts in this direction .
training , organization of sym@@ posi@@ a and workshops , and dissemination of educational information are very useful .
and this threatens our aim is to set up an integrated and consistent statistical system .
methodological problems are being examined and efforts will be made to find a solution .
all these criteria must be considered to maintain and manage a statistical system that is reliable and can be used in the future .

if the credit terms are acceptable , state authorities in our countries should be included in the discussions .
the World Bank has certain rules for extending credit to countries .
the countries are grouped in certain categories .
one of the main indicators for this grouping is the per capita gross national product ( GNP ) in US dollars .
( these estimates are based on the information supplied by each country . )
loans are extended for 15 , 17 , 25 , and 30 years .
I do not know exactly what the conditions are for Kazakhstan , but you can meet out experts in Alma A@@ ty and gather more information from them .
Gi@@ or@@ gio BO@@ N@@ AC@@ CI , HE@@ AD OF UN@@ IT , TRA@@ IN@@ ING , SO@@ C@@ IAL adjustments AND advice TO governments , EU / T@@ AC@@ IS
priorities have to be set for allocating funds .
the statistical offices should provide solid arguments for their case so that their requests are taken into account by the deci@@ sion@@ makers .
when a specific amount is ear@@ marked in an annual budget for different activities , impact and conting@@ ency priorities have to be s@@ oundly argued .
many central statistical offices have bilateral agreements .
the Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics has agreements with IN@@ SE@@ E , France , the St@@ ati@@ sti@@ sch@@ es Bundes@@ am@@ t , Germany , and the Central Statistical Office of Poland .
the actions include week @@@ -@@ @ long courses or visits by experts to study specific problems .
I would like to know whether the T@@ AC@@ IS programme could fund at least some of these bilateral actions and projects .
most of the experts ' missions to and from French and German organisations are often already funded and supported by the T@@ AC@@ IS programme and Euro@@ stat , although CIS offices may not be aware of this .
I believe that we should first identify the problems and only after equip ourselves to solve them .
shall we start from the global system or from concrete actions ?
economic reforms have raised real life problems , which need action rather than discussions on global problems .
new companies are being created and we lack the means to collect this information .
computer@@ isation is just one of the tools .
what is needed is methodology .
it is a question of methodology , how you do it .
users ' needs should be taken into account to avoid producing useless information .
in Uzbekistan we try do our best to solve problems as they come up .
we should take assistance when it is offered .
we have a good training centre which is the only organisation in the former Soviet Union which co @@@ -@@ @ operates with all the other CIS republics .
resolving each problem as it comes up can , however , create a problem in the long run .
if a car is constructed bit by bit and there are difficulties in the process , it will be hard to make it run .
this analogy can be applied to the problem of regional disparities .
in the richer parts of the Russian Federation , things are organised and run smoothly .
but when all the parts have to be assembled together , the system no longer works because of different standards , concepts , and attitudes .
a statistics project in the EU is not undertaken without an inde@@ p@@ th analysis of what users want and need .
before starting a project the following question should be asked : is the project truly necessary ?
the project is not taken up if there are doubts or mis@@ gi@@ vings .

we need a vision for the future , but we C@@ AN@@ NOT do away with what we have .
we live in another environment with different rules of the game , which can be a source of misunderstandings .
it is difficult to imagine how only one computer can serve 200 people .
the conditions are almost the complete opposite of the conditions that prevail in your countries .
we should try to understand the situation , but you should also try to put yourselves in our place .
certainly we shall arrive at the problems discussed during this seminar , but that will be in d@@ instant future . the
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS problems that confront us today are much more basic and if we fail to solve them today , we shall not be able to build the future .

this is the second seminar of this kind organised by Euro@@ stat .
the work @@@ -@@ @ plan which I drafted a couple of years ago fores@@ aw training in foreign languages .
this indication was followed by our office and the training provided by Euro@@ stat proved very useful for our staff members .
I would like to draw Mr Bel@@ kind@@ as ' attention to the problems related to the distribution of the World Bank 's funds .
the loans provided by the World Bank are those given to all transition economies .
the provisions were designed 4 years ago and were based on parameters that were valid then . they now need to be adjusted to current circumstances .
with World Bank 's assistance a project was started in household and employment statistics which is one of the highest priority for us .
however World Bank 's funds had already been distributed among more powerful institutions ( National Bank , Ministry of Economics , Ministry of Finance and others ) .
as far as publications are concerned , we shall produce them under any circumstances .
a little sum has already been allocated for the establishment of a mini @@@ -@@ @ ty@@ po@@ graphy .
additional funds for this purpose would be particularly useful .
ion TO@@ B@@ UL@@ TO@@ C , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ ATE DE@@ PAR@@ T@@ MENT FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICS , MO@@ L@@ DO@@ VA
my colleagues have already expressed the difficulties we are faced with .
we all are still far away from our goals .
our wish is to accelerate the reform process in statistics .
it is clear that transition countries are trying to find the money where it is available .
it would be useful if T@@ AC@@ IS funds could be allocated for bilateral projects , for example , between Denmark and Moldova to implement Euro@@ stat 's recommendations also at technological level .
I dare say that we are making some progress .
we should , however , avoid idealism and seek a workable and manageable solution .
specific tasks , based on the general framework , have to be defined and implemented .
it is simpler to build some small boxes that fit into the general framework than to build a huge system .
to reduce costs , on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ job training , implementation , and actual operation should be conducted as one procedure .
the resources required for carrying out these small tasks should be shared between the donor and recipient country , and the methodology should be provided by the donor country .
technical assistance could be provided in certain cases .
the statistical office should approach its government to request that a percentage of a World Bank loan be ear@@ marked for a particular purpose , such as purchase of equipment .
the government should accept that it shares the cost of running the system with the statistical office .
otherwise the statistical office would acquire a system only to discover that it had no resources to run it .
each country will have a specific request corresponding to its particular background and traditions .
however , certain points such as seasonal adjustment can be considered across the board .
most countries need training in the methodology for industrial and retail statistics and in their use .
classification and the translation into Russian of software packages are also general problems .
spread@@ sheets , word@@ processors , and graphics programs could be prepared in collaboration with the CIS countries .
bilateral agreements could be broad@@ ened into tril@@ ateral agreements .
they would include not only an EU and a CIS country , but also an eastern or central European country to share the experience .
I would like to reply to Mr Tol@@ bu@@ to@@ c and to Mr L@@ end@@ v@@ ai at the same time .
we can of course finance bilateral actions and support efforts made by Denmark in Moldova .
but we can also support triangular activities .
and this is what is already happening in Moldova , where experts already trained in Romania by IN@@ SE@@ E ( France ) are in their turn offering assistance to the Statistical Office of Moldova .
I believe that first of all it is needed to change the statistical production system and that technology has to depend on this .
indeed the statistical production system has to come first .
to re @@@ -@@ @ computer@@ ise the system inherited from the Soviet Union would cost 10 times as much then to support modern methodology with adequate equipment .

did you completely give up the old system or are you developing new methodology in parallel to the old ones ?
we gave up the old at the very beginning of transition .
it was very hard to convince the Government .
we took the radical decision to reject exhaus@@ tive statistics .
we C@@ AN@@ NOT collect all the data from all the enterprises .
they would not be reliable data .
classifications have changed .
a written detailed description of how you did it could be extremely useful for the other countries .
we shall do it .
Mikhail Korol@@ ev , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E OF CIS
we should not forget however that the economic situation of the CIS countries is extremely difficult .
up to 90 % of enterprises in most countries are still state owned .
they should be privati@@ sed , but the resources for this operation are insufficient .
therefore my colleagues are still obliged to collect an enormous quantity of data for the user : the government .
it is a vicious circle .
now allow me to be frank .
sometimes we do not understand the way assistance is provided .
you are using resources to reward consultants .
we do not have financial resources .
if your resources were directly available to us , under your control of course , you would see our efficiency improve greatly .
we would be grateful if you could simplify and accelerate .
session VIII
evaluation and conclusions
we arrived at the last stage of our seminar which is meant to draw the conclusions .
I am sure you have learned a great deal , but we have also learned a lot .
today 's discussion will be organised as follows .
Mr Hol@@ der will tackle the organisation links between statistical projects and their computer@@ ization .
Mr Vil@@ ares will deal with transition in inform@@ atics , possibilities , potentials and strategies to move from one situation to another .
Mr Tur@@ lot will deal with the problems of management of computer and human resources and with funding of management .
Mr De V@@ ries will mainly concentrate on follow up to the lessons learned from this seminar .
E@@ gon HO@@ LD@@ ER , FOR@@ M@@ ER PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT OF ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ I@@ SC@@ H@@ ES Bundes@@ am@@ t , H@@ IG@@ H LE@@ VE@@ L ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL adviser FOR THE RUS@@ S@@ IAN FE@@ D@@ ER@@ ATION , G@@ ER@@ MAN@@ Y
the purpose of this seminar was not only to provide information , but also to give solutions for accelerating computer@@ ization in the CIS statistical offices .
some steps have already been taken in certain countries .
lack of funds for equipment purchase is a common problem .
credit can be obtained from banks when a private sector company demonstrates its performance and economic viability .
a master plan is therefore indispensable .
it would include work forecasts and productivity targets and explain how computer@@ ization will support statistical work to meet current needs .
as everything C@@ AN@@ NOT be done simultaneously , priorities must be determined right at the outset .
if the office is successful , it can later negotiate with the World Bank and other organisations to obtain funds for other parts of the master plan .
the main task is to convince the CIS governments that such measures are important .
discussions on computer@@ ization should be held with all departments and computer experts .
the question whether older equipment should be used is still the subject of debate .
personal computers should be considered for smaller work units .
in certain cases the old equipment can be used until the transition period is over .
a statistical office that has its own computer centre can guarantee confidentiality of data as no unauthorised access is permitted from the outside .
data protection is a very important factor irrespective of laws , since companies will supply data only if confidentiality is guar@@ anti@@ ed .
CIS offices must also decide whether projects have to be developed separately for each country or for a group of countries .
statistical departments in the CIS have one task that does not exist in western countries .
in western systems , this is not a statistical task and it is considered a serious infringement on privacy .
previously , statistical offices in the EU carried out administrative tasks to assist the authorities in the management and supervision of public sector enterprises .
now these tasks are carried out by ministries or not done at all .
monthly collection of statistics to monitor public sector comp@@ ames is considered unnecessary .
a few financial reports ( quarterly or semi @@@ -@@ @ annual ) are sufficient .
if a ministry needs monthly information , it collects the data itself , and the statistics office selects the information it needs from the ministry .
there is no doubt that if data have to be collected monthly from all production units , the computer system should be designed accordingly .
if , on the contrary there are quarterly or semi @@@ -@@ @ annual reports based on samples , the computer technology is completely different .
we understand that you are in a transition phase , but I think that it is important to point out that monthly data collection is no longer accomplished in western Europe and that it is not seen as a task for stati@@ sti@@ cians .
MI@@ K@@ A@@ IL Korol@@ ev , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E OF THE CIS ON ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICS
Mr Fran@@ ch@@ et , everything you said is well known .
in the past we also had a decentr@@ alised statistical system .
in those times our stati@@ sti@@ cians were only involved in population cens@@ uses , to process data during years , make deep analytical research , give more importance to science .
it was an easy life for stati@@ sti@@ cians .
then a centr@@ alised and planned system was introduced .
now this system is being destroyed , we shall have to pass again to a decentr@@ alised system , and we understand from what you say that we shall probably require less resources .
the transition period can be very long .
unfortunately at present the two systems are co existing and a lot of resources are needed .
we agree with you .
help us to shor@@ ten the process .
we could restructure the system more easily if we had the necessary equipment and would be thankful .
BE@@ K@@ I An@@ na@@ ev , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ ATE ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E , Turkmenistan
I want to support Mr Korol@@ ev 's words with concrete examples .
we have an obsolete system and a back@@ log of information that must be processed .
we have tried to abandon some of the tasks that were carried out in the past .
we were immediately rebu@@ ked and questioned on the reasons for doing so .
I explained that monthly reports did not give any results .
the authorities of my country immediately offered resources to continue old activities .
the government requires information about production .
we are obliged to work with outdated data collection systems in which a few new elements have been incorporated .
information collecting during transition to a market economy is an important task .
the Government of Tajikistan decided to make major changes .
statistical offices are now under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Forec@@ asting .
in countries where 90 % of the statistical staff spend their time collecting information for state bodies it is hard to place some kind of limitation to data collection .
moreover , the entire budget of@@ statistical offices is funded by the State and this could produce adverse effects .
stati@@ sti@@ cians carry out analyses , determine macro @@@ -@@ @ economic indices , and pass the information to state bodies .
the more accurately we perform our work the more the government is open to our needs .
expansion of the statistical information base would interest both state bodies and statistical offices .
if the demand for information from state bodies increases , the State would have to provide additional funds for computer@@ ization of the statistical offices .
presently we C@@ AN@@ NOT reduce the quantity of information without risking to see our resources cut .
but probably in the long @@@ -@@ @ run we shall also be able to reduce it .
E@@ gon HO@@ LD@@ ER , FOR@@ M@@ ER PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT OF ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ I@@ SC@@ H@@ ES Bundes@@ am@@ t , H@@ IG@@ H LE@@ VE@@ L ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL adviser FOR THE RUS@@ S@@ IAN FE@@ D@@ ER@@ ATION , G@@ ER@@ MAN@@ Y
basing myself on the experience of my country , and , I believe , of other European countries , I would say that we need to know which information should be collected , how often , and to which bodies it should be disseminated .
it is important to keep the eyes open on what is happening internationally , therefore this seminar in Luxembourg was very useful .
cooperative actions can be coordinated once the planned tasks are known .
otherwise it will be difficult to carry out all the tasks .
tim@@ eliness is an important factor .
governments should also be made aware that the problems will not be solved without financing .
the representative of Tajikistan mentioned that funding of statistics is done 100 % from the public budget .
this is not unusual , also in Europe statistics collection is often fully funded through the public budget .
it is a structural measure for a country 's infrastructure development .
stati@@ sti@@ cians should be given the possibility to participate in planning workshops with government officials and make the position of statistics clear .

there is not an unique solution for the drawbacks of the computing systems that have just been mentioned .
the experience of western countries can not be " exported " to the New Independent States .
they must , by their own means , to find out the solution which fits the best with their specific situation and history .
on these conditions , a correct strategy for high level seminars is , in my opinion , not to impose solutions .
on the contrary , it is important to select topics for discussion , from where it should be possible to achieve the adequ@@ ated solution .
what role must play the Administration files ?
shall they arrive until a unique person number ?
in statistical terms it is very efficient , but w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t that be dangerous ?
is@@ n '@@ t it the actual processing statistical system ( with three hier@@ ar@@ qu@@ ical levels : district , Regional and Central ) too heavy and too demanding in terms of personal and in terms of computer equipment ?
what is the " optimal " degree of decentr@@ alisation and what must be the role of the computer centre ?
- the growing unemployment ( and the fact that inform@@ atisation will reduce drastically the staff of statistical services ) .
- the sizeable anc@@ illary costs .
how to integrate the statistical information system in the nation information system , and how can the experience of western nations in the field be useful for NIS countries ?

I am sorry , but I disagree with Mr Vil@@ ares .
stati@@ sti@@ cians in the CIS are prepared psychologically , technologically and professionally to work in new conditions , but they lack equipment and resources .
I do not exclude that some experts might leave after training , but the risk is not very high .
our stati@@ sti@@ cians could have left a few years ago for higher salaries , but they are keen on their work .
if they are given the tools within the statistical office , they would work with more enthusiasm .
I think that we do not have to worry about staff : it is the only resource we have in sufficient quantity and which gives us the possibility to hope for success .
Vladimir G@@ OR@@ Y@@ ACH@@ K@@ OV@@ SK@@ Y , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ ATE ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E , K@@ AZ@@ AK@@ H@@ ST@@ AN
perhaps Mr Vil@@ ares forget the documents we have discussed together .
all the work on statistical restructuring is based on the programme prepared carefully by the Committee .
he also saw the privatization programme of our Government .
it is its property .
therefore when we talk about exhaus@@ tive reporting , we do not have to forget what is its purpose .
I would like to intervene in support of Mr Vil@@ ares because , in spite of Ms Ivan@@ ova 's opinion , he did touch a topical problem .
stati@@ sti@@ cians are paid less than in other ministries .
trained experts may leave the statistical office to join the private sector where their expertise is needed .
it is expensive to train staff .
I understand my colleagues from CIS countries , concerning their worries to give up monthly exhaus@@ tive reports .
governments are changing frequently and every new head of government requires data to support his action ...
in this respect I would have a proposal .
cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t Euro@@ stat or , even better , the EU , help us explain the basic responsibilities of a statistical office in a market economy to the CIS governments .
these administrations should be informed that the present method ( e.g. , national system of monthly accounts ) is not the best .
I would also like to go back to yesterday 's discussion , when Poland and Hungary offered their services .
Lithuania accepted this offer already three years ago , and a bilateral agreement was signed with the two neighbouring countries ; work is progressing well .
Poland and Hungary could indeed share their experience in turning socialist statistics into statistics of a modern market economy .
it would be interesting to start a debate about this question .
it is a very direct question , but its sounds like this : either you use the equipment for new tasks or , if you want to continue with the old work , you will not receive it .
so , it would be wis@@ er , that we reply that this technology will be indeed used for new projects and that we shall move along the lines indicated by you .
we are also trying to dis@@ continue monthly data collection and reporting .
the situation is more or less the same in all the countries .
it is difficult , but we are going along the lines .
it is hard however , since , as far as I know , also in other CIS countries , resources for the public administration continue to shrink in the current weak and unstable economic situation .
but I think we can promise you that , we shall try to use the new equipment for new tasks .
in this respect lessons could be learned from the experience of the Baltic countries , Poland , and Hungary , in doing away with the old systems and adapting to international standards .
this is why the PH@@ ARE and T@@ AC@@ IS programmes have been conceived , to support the first step towards a democratization of statistics .
a seminar could be devoted to these topics where our colleagues from Eastern Europe could share their experience
we need to convince our governments and the public that we must take the right path .
accurate statistics produced with modern equipment will create a reputation of reliability among state holders .
I would like to make an effort to make peace between Ms Ivan@@ ova and Mr Vil@@ ares .
we do not have to take everything literally .
the old system although bur@@ den@@ some , allows us , during the transition period to prepare national accounts according to the requests of OECD , without too many problems .
the 1990 , 1991 , and 1992 national accounts have been published ; those for 1993 are underway .
we are trying to proceed by priorities , and technology and equipment are a priority .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS statistics has begun with assistance from the World Bank .
changes are introduced step by step , but the old and new systems C@@ AN@@ NOT work in tandem .
let 's be realistic .
the structure of industry for 90 % has not changed .
for instance , Belarus has a population of 10 million , and per capita chemical production is 23 times that of the United States .
another example is offered by the tractor plant in Minsk , which was practically the only tractor plant in all the USSR .
the income of our country was derived from mechanical engineering , chemicals , and agricultural engineering ; now industry has almost collapsed .
popular discontent is worrying the government and the government wants figures every day on production status .
for a few years we have to cope with this situation and we C@@ AN@@ NOT do away with some archa@@ ic structures .
the country is full of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ isms as old fashioned systems which co @@@ -@@ @ exist with the new market economy , which is the new trend which we want to follow .
we have to find an intermediate position .
reform of the statistics system has already brought in many changes .
we negotiated a loan with the World Bank which is soon coming in .
it would be useful now to have reports from Poland and Hungary on how they attempt to resolve the problems o@@ fin@@ formation collection and dissemination .
I am pleased that my provocation received a response .
I intended to provoke this discussion to give you the opportunity to inform the international organisations about your real situation in support of request of financial assistance .
concerning staff drain due to personal leaving for better paid sectors , I was referring to my experience .
in Portugal as well , despite the increase in salaries of highly qualified staff , the statistical office lost many to the private sector where salaries are 23 times higher .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS
you must therefore follow a development strategy while seeking the least expensive means .
3.1 Before applying for a big loan for your equipment , you should see what resources you will have for keeping your equipment running .
3.2 You should preferably select architectures which are easy to maintain , and as similar as possible .
probably you will also have to ask yourselves a difficult question .
will the best thing be to dismiss them , and add to the number of unemployed , which is a factor in the social dis@@ location in your countries ?
I shall conclude with a question which I asked myself when I was putting myself in your place .
Mr Tur@@ lot mentioned the importance of simplicity and homogen@@ e@@ ity of equipment and software , that is of stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation .
MS Ker@@ te@@ z@@ s made an exercise worth to be introduced .

data CO@@ LL@@ EC@@ TION
Oracle is quite widely used as a database management system .
Bla@@ ise is used for data collection , including designing of questionnaires and data input .
the stati@@ sti@@ cians ' real work involves calculation of aggre@@ gates , analysis , and dissemination .
the most commonly used tools are on the personal computer platform .
SAS and EX@@ CE@@ L often serve as the main tool for statistical analysis .
we started using LO@@ T@@ US some years ago ; the word processor is Word for Windows .
SAS and LO@@ T@@ US do not have the same function .
we use SAS and SP@@ PS for statistical analysis and LO@@ T@@ US for tab@@ ulation .
perhaps SAS has more advanced functions than LO@@ T@@ US .
in our case , both OR@@ AC@@ LE and SAS have LO@@ T@@ US as the interface ; data can be retrieved from the OR@@ AC@@ LE database and processed on SAS and LO@@ T@@ US .
we tried to stand@@ ar@@ dise tools according to those used in countries with similar features .
too many tools should be avoided for the same function or else it will be difficult to communicate between different departments .
Oracle has been mentioned many times ; it is good , but very expensive .
we have many tools that do the same functions more in@@ expen@@ sively .
the survey may be good for ideas , but the cost of every solution should be considered .

in Georgia , statistics no longer seems an interesting activity for young people , it is not a priority for them .
it is not cost @@@ -@@ @ effective to train someone who will retire in 5 or 6 years .
training strategies of the T@@ AC@@ IS programme should consider this point .
as far equipment is concerned , a master plan is absolutely essential to prepare cooperative projects with Euro@@ stat or other international organizations .
statistical offices in the CIS are not over@@ staffed , as it is commonly believed .
in The Netherlands , for example , the Central Bureau of Statistics has a staff strength of 2500 .
our central statistical office of Belarus has only 400 staff .
this excludes the regional offices , which collect statistics as in Germany .
future developments and tasks will require that the centre is re @@@ -@@ @ in@@ forced .

our leaders have to be persuaded that we need resources for the statistical office .
but other sectors , such as health , also seek to do the same ; the statistical office is therefore in a somewhat weaker position .
perhaps Euro@@ stat and other institutions , such as the United Nations , could write to our governments .
we have recommendations for restructuring the office , but a letter from Euro@@ stat reiter@@ ating the recommendations would be more effective .
our government is familiar with your activities , since we are obliged to report to it about technical assistance we receive from you and this kind of seminar is very useful .
we need to reflect on the follow @@@ -@@ @ up of this seminar .
certain areas will be proposed by Mr De V@@ ries .
suggestions for actions to be taken during the coming months can then be discussed .
W@@ LL@@ LE@@ M DE V@@ ries , DE@@ PUT@@ Y D@@ IR@@ EC@@ TO@@ R G@@ ENER@@ AL , ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICS NE@@ TH@@ ER@@ LAN@@ DS ,
therefore , I ap@@ olog@@ ise beforehand if I repeat some things that have already been said .
first of all , during this week I was reminded several times of an old Dutch saying , going back to the days of the large sailing ships .
around our harb@@ ours there used to be large groups of on@@ loo@@ kers , watching the ships man@@ oeu@@ vre into and out of the harbour , commenting about what the cap@@ tains ought to do and cri@@ ti@@ sizing them for wrong moves .
the sailors said about this phenomenon : " the best cap@@ tains always stand ash@@ ore . "
I sometimes felt the same about the comments made during this seminar .
who are we to tell these cap@@ tains how to sail their statistical ships ?
secondly , although FS@@ U @@@ -@@ @ republics have certain things in common , they are at the same time very different , also in terms of statistical computing .
good computers are not the same as good statistics .
the most valuable assets of FS@@ U statistical offices are , as Dr. K@@ ö@@ ni@@ g very rightly said , people and data , not technology .
fourth , my advise would be : think big , act small ( or rather : carefully , step by step ) .
if you feel that you can develop such a master@@ plan yourself , do it .
if you need help , ask Euro@@ stat for a consultant , but make sure that the consultant understands statistics .
perhaps it would be a good idea to involve consultants from countries that have been through a similar process of development , such as Poland or Hungary .
fifth , do no throw away your old shoes before you have new ones .
by this I mean , that continuity of statistical production is essential .
your users will expect from you , that old statistical series are continued .
however , if your old shoes really hurt , it may be necessary to try bare feet for a while .
I think that many FS@@ U statistical offices do some work , perhaps even a lot of work in some cases , that is not really statistical ( detailed data collection about production etc . ) .
try to convince your users ( like it was done in e.g. Estonia ) that this work should be done by others , for instance the responsible ministries , because there are other statistical priorities .
sixth . do not waste good , modern technology on old statistics .
it is my impression that most FS@@ U statistical offices are still too modest in their public relations .
if you want to convince your governments that statistics are worthwhile and interesting , try to make some attractive publications , give regular press conferences , try to be on television every week .
perhaps some resources of T@@ AC@@ IS and other programmes should be invested in printing and dissemination technology .
eighth and final point .
second hand equipment .
I still believe that this is a good possibility to help FS@@ U statistical offices ahead .
it is not the only sol@@ ut@@ tion , but it can be a useful step forward .
a very rough estimate is , that the statistical offices of the European Union each year have about 1000 redundant , but fairly modern PC 's available ( 3@@ 86 and upward ) .
if the transfer of these machines to FS@@ U statistical offices could be organised efficiently , it would make a great contribution to their technological advancement .
however , it is not an easy task , as we have found out when we installed a small computer network in the statistical office of Georgia .
we are about to do the same for Azerbaijan .
it is not so much a matter of money as a matter of time , organisation and manpower .

Mr De V@@ ries suggested to take off old shoes if they really hurt .

we should not use the word " old " describing the equipment we received from the Netherlands , since this equipment has been used but it is solid and quite efficient .
when we talk about personal computers as being second hand , they are about 3 years old .
Mikhail Korol@@ ev , PRE@@ S@@ ID@@ ENT , ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMM@@ IT@@ TE@@ E OF THE CIS
seminars such as this one are particularly helpful ; they yield fresh ideas .
many missions are undertaken by the western experts to the CIS , but there is often a duplication of efforts .
questionnaires have helped us make some head@@ way .
Euro@@ stat could consider establishing a permanent standing committee of CIS representatives who could work on a long@@ term basis to establish good relations .
the group could start with three members co @@@ -@@ @ opted on a rot@@ ational basis .
the representatives could be posted here , depending on the possibilities within the EU organizations .
we also need perhaps tw@@ o@@ - or three @@@ -@@ @ week courses on the use of new E@@ DP technology on a permanent basis .
there should be a permanent flow of information .
the courses could be conducted in a wel@@ le@@ qui@@ pped centre , perhaps in Germany or at Euro@@ stat .
the requests of the recipient countries should be taken into consideration : most countries need hardware , some need software , and some need to finance salaries .
these projects already exist in all CIS countries .
the financing process is complex and bureaucratic .
Euro@@ stat could probably facilitate the financing process by li@@ a@@ ising with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and other organizations .
we are all trying to prove to our governments that statistics are necessary and important in a market economy , but we need moral support for it .
Western organizations could support these efforts when they send missions to CIS countries .
a press release could also be issued and draw attention to this priority .
we have noted your suggestions and will be taking most of them on board .
nevertheless I would like to react to one of the suggestions on training , particularly regarding computers .
I think this training should be as close as possible to the users of computer equipment .
what we could organize is the training of trainers , or instructors .
perhaps we could also provide some teaching materials for CIS offices in order to train staff .
the video cass@@ ettes and self @@@ -@@ @ training systems could be translated from French and English into Russian .
the Hungarian office is ready to provide more detailed material and organize a seminar to share its experience with the CIS offices .
it would cover the reshap@@ ing and restructuring of the statistical process , and technical development ( including installation ) procedures .
we could organize a seminar with our colleagues from Poland and the Czech and Slovak Repub@@ lics who have the same sort of experience .
the Baltic countries also have some experience that would be useful to the CIS offices .
session IX
I was not present during the week , but was during the introduction .
I particularly appreciated the discussions you started yesterday and continued today .
I share the conclusions proposed by the high @@@ -@@ @ level panel , but would like to mention a few points which struck me as particularly important .
the first is the diversity of your situations .
it is very clear , indeed , when taking into account Mrs. Ivan@@ ova 's strong points that there are differing situations within the Federation itself between the rich and the poor regions .
we have seen this diversity in the European Union as well , and we are familiar with it .
it brings us to consider different solutions ; there is no single panacea or recipe for everyone .
as Mrs. Ivan@@ ova said , many who undertook quick training had to absorb a lot of material .
as our Armenian colleague stated , it costs around 800 man months to be able to purchase equipment .
is this the best way to use scarce resources ?
individual or tailor @@@ -@@ @ made solutions need to be considered .
your view must be different , with a clear idea of where you would like to be in five years ' time .
you may not get there , but at least you will know in which direction to go .

I am glad the Hun@@ garians have agreed to take part in it .

I will do everything possible in the EU to help you get the support of your political authorities , organising missions and supplying teaching material .
there is no need to have exhaus@@ tive monthly data to manage your public sector system .
no decisions are taken on these data .
they must be replaced by sampling techniques .
tell your government that they are less expensive .
Tajikistan , for example , has 88 % of its activities on the old system with very little room to man@@ oeu@@ vre .
stati@@ sti@@ cians are expected to continue these activities and if they do not because they C@@ AN@@ NOT , they are dismissed .
this is a very difficult situation .
other countries have solved this problem .
political interventions with prime ministers , presidents and heads of states are needed , with the support of the EU to create a dialogue and assist you in getting out of the woods .
as stated by Mr. Tur@@ lot and Mr. de V@@ ries , we have to remember that computers are not the solution to every problem .
modem computers have to work with new projects and not be used to manage the old system with all its massive data . in this way , we will be more able to assist you .
Mr. Korol@@ ev 's brought up some very interesting points , that is , psychological and moral support and awareness of politicians .
it may be useful to issue press releases which back you politically .
Mr. Korol@@ ev raised two other points which I need to reflect on at greater length .
the first was whether it is possible for us to make the funding process simpler for you .
I have been working on the Committee for Fun@@ ding for seven years and still lack a solution , but I am trying to arrive at one .
however , even if the funding process is simplified , there will still be the problem of chann@@ elling the funds through your government authorities .

T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by creating links and lasting relationships between organisations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Community .
the T@@ ac@@ is Programme is a European Community Initiative for the New Independent States and Mongolia which fo@@ sters the development of harmonious and prosperous economic and political links between the European Union and these partner countries .
T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of transformation to market economies and democratic societies .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
as part of a broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations , which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
the European Community 's T@@ ac@@ is Programme is unique In its breadth , the number of countries It involves and the type of support it offers .
the Programme is devoted to the transfer of know @@@ -@@ @ how towards economic transformation and the development of democracy .
the workload placed on individual T@@ ac@@ is task managers is so high that we are near to a point where the workload C@@ AN@@ NOT be sustained unless it is matched by sufficient staff@@ ing .
in particular I would like to recognise the contribution made by Sir Leon Brit@@ tan , the Commissioner responsible for the T@@ ac@@ is Programme until December 1994 .
his per s@@ onal In@@ vol@@ vement has played an Import@@ ant role in the improvement of the Programme 's performance and effectiveness .
its success , therefore , is dependent on the ability to establish effective working relationships between partners .
1994 has been an important year in this respect .
the year 1994 has seen the development of initiatives which have provided a solid platform for T@@ AD@@ S to build on .
I fully expect to see the benefits of this reflected in its performance in the near future .
the year was also important in that T@@ ac@@ is became more sharply focused on those sectors and regions where its support can be used most effectively .
the Programme was able to do this since 1994 was the first year that a significant number of projects were under implementation or reached completion and it was therefore possible to begin a process of monitoring and evaluating the success of projects .
the work rate of the Programme also increased substantially .
in its relationships with the European Parliament , other institutions and key groups , significant steps have been taken to improve communication and the supply of information .
1994 was a significant year for T@@ ac@@ is .
its political framework was reinforced through the development of Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements - signed with the Russian Federation , Ukraine and Moldova and initi@@ alled with Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Belarus .
these Agre@@ ements draw together all the elements of European Community support to the countries of the former Soviet Union and provide the framework for economic and political cooperation within which T@@ AD@@ S operates .
the Programme has also sharpen@@ ed its focus on a number of cross@@ sectoral Issues , Inclu@@ ding the promotion of democracy , the role of women and protection of the environment .
these issues are examined In more detail In the following chapters .
in the area of management , T@@ AD@@ S has significantly improved Its financial performance and taken important steps to make its operations more efficient .
in particular , It has done this by introducing a greater element of dec@@ en
the governments in most of the New Independent States are still coping with the problems of establishing the mechanics of democratic government and building a new system of public administration and local government .
unsurprisingly , there are still many difficulties , both in maintaining democratic government and In developing the skills necessary to run a functioning democracy .
• industrial inter @@@ -@@ @ dependence • industrial ' mon@@ oc@@ ulture ' • central planning . command @@@ -@@ @ driven production • trade based on state orders . service sectors that are in their infancy .
in 1994 an important development took place which provided an overall framework for future relations between the European Union and its partners .
in the case of the Russian Federation , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan the Agre@@ ements foresee the negotiation of agreements on trade in nuclear materials .
sectoral agree ments on steel should be concluded with the Russian Federation , Ukraine and Kazakhstan .
agreements were signed with the Russian Federation and Ukraine in June , with Moldova in November and were initi@@ alled with Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Belarus .
explor@@ atory discussions were held with Georgia during 1994 .
the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides an umbrella for the activities of T@@ ac@@ is .
in particular the Agreement identifies those areas of economic cooperation for which T@@ ac@@ is Is the source of funding .
the contracting back@@ log from earlier years and the Tim@@ e@@ Sp@@ an between commitments and contracting were thus significantly reduced .
in 1994 , the T@@ AD@@ S Programme committed a total of EC@@ U 4@@ 70 million to its partner countries , Inclu@@ ding EC@@ U 10 million for the T@@ ac@@ is Democracy Programme .
the Programme paid out EC@@ U 300@@ .@@ 3 million , an Incre@@ ase of 66 per cent from the previous year and 41 per cent more than the amount paid out over the three previous years together .
this means that of the total T@@ ac@@ is commitments , 61 per cent has now been contracted , and of the amount contracted 48 per cent has been paid .
the time lag between commitment and payment is normal for a programme of this type .
this rate of disbur@@ sement Is slightly better than average when compared to other major assistance programmes .

this avoided the need to produce an Individual Action Programme every year .
in parallel , the implementation of projects accelerated significantly , as demonstrated by the rise in contracting .
this means that In 1994 , T@@ ac@@ is started and implemented more projects and mobil@@ ised more experts than ever before .
the time lag between the approval of Action Program@@ mes and the start of the implementation of projects was also reduced .
improving performance
in 1994 , T@@ AD@@ S was able to commit its annual budget much more rapidly than In previous years .
23 per cent of the 1994 budget was approved by March , 71 per cent by July and 93 per cent was approved by the end of September .
this was a significant improvement on the previous year when the bulk of the budget was only approved during the last three months of the year .
in 1994 , steps were taken to Im@@ prove the coordination of internal T@@ ac@@ is management and to clarify and simplify procedures .
T@@ AC@@ IS was able to achieve this improvement as a result of initiatives taken in 1993 to establish multi @@@ -@@ @ annual programming .
in addition , in 1994 the T@@ ac@@ is services set up a system for the regular and comprehensive preparation of all experts working on T@@ ac@@ is projects .
an important new initiative in monitoring and evaluation was introduced in 1994 .
teams of monitors made up of independent experts from both the European Community and the relevant partner country have been assessing the design and results of the projects as well as their relevance to the needs of the partner countries .
the exception was nuclear safety , where the Implementation of monitoring is taking longer due to the complex technical nature of the projects .
monitoring in the nuclear safety sector will start In 1995 .
more recently , Deleg@@ ations were also opened in Kazakhstan and Georgia .
technical offices will be established In those regions of the Russian Federation where T@@ ac@@ is has set up separate regional programmes .
however , It is only recently that the conditions have started to emerge , in terms of establishing management structures in each country , that allow substantial developments to be made In this area .
the European Community Institutions and advisory bodies , Member States and the partner countries have shown considerable interest in the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
the Coordin@@ ating Un@@ its have become valid partners and useful counterparts for T@@ ac@@ is , representing an effective and credible liaison with the government authorities .
T@@ AC@@ IS is increasingly using tw@@ inning to promote reform . tw@@ inning creates partnerships between similar groups in different countries to facilitate mutual cooperation and training .
under the second objective , two calls for proposals from these organisations were launched in 1994 , in parallel with the Ph@@ are Democracy Programme .
T@@ AC@@ IS took some important initiatives concerning these Issues In 1994 , which are detailed below .
the reduction in economically sustainable employment opportunities .
for example , there should be a balance of male and female participants in seminars and training courses .
T@@ AD@@ S also financed a conference in Moscow in December 1994 on improving the opportunities for female entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation .
this was In response to a number of queries which came to the fore In 1994 .
these changes , and T@@ AD@@ S ' operations in general , were presented in a series of high @@@ -@@ @ level meetings between the Parliament and the Commission , backed by an exchange of extensive Information .

T@@ AC@@ IS projects in the energy field in progress in 1994 focused on the ration@@ alisation and diversification of the energy supply .
privatisation remains a priority policy for the Armenian Government , although some nation@@ alised enterprises will have to continue operating under state control .
T@@ AC@@ IS help to Armenia concentrates on

the country 's energy sector has the potential to provide the impetus for overall economic advancement , but has suffered from a lack of Investment and from poor maintenance of the pipeline network .
given this situation , energy has been identified as a key area for T@@ ac@@ is involvement .
T@@ AC@@ IS has also given priority to accelerating the fle@@ dg@@ ling programme of privatisation and to developing a banking sector which will support the growth of enterprise .
in order to maxim@@ ise the effectiveness of the Programme , T@@ ac@@ is is concentrating on three areas :
the T@@ ac@@ is 1994 budget commits EC@@ U 8 million for the national programme with Azerbaijan .
in the absence of a privatisation plan approved by parliament , little formal privatisation has taken place , although a number of laws have been passed to facilitate the privatisation process .
positive steps have been taken In the energy sector , despite problems relating to the reduction of domestic oil and gas production .
a large T@@ ac@@ is project began in 1994 , offering expert input on many aspects of energy policy to the Government and the State Oil Company .
this has included advice on legal questions relating to the oil resources of the country , with particular emphasis on preparing for Azerbaijan 's signature of the European Energy Charter .

the modernisation of the country 's transportation systems has also been Identi@@ fied as mer@@ iting strong T@@ ac@@ is involvement .

the main areas of T@@ ac@@ is support for Belarus in 1994 were :

the T@@ ac@@ is 1994 budget committed EC@@ U 7 million for the national programme in Belarus .
the first part of the project aims to provide advice and practical support for the ministry charged with the development of small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) to set up seven regional Enterprise Support Centres and train their staff .
the second objective is the development of consultancy services for SMEs throughout Belarus .
in the sphere of privatisation , in 1994 T@@ ac@@ is started to provide advice for the Ministry of State Property on the vou@@ cher privatisation programme and its implementation .

enhancing the transport infrastructure
four new projects are being launched In the transport sector in Belarus , aimed at developing the structure of transport systems and supporting their modernisation .
the largest contract is to implement technical and institutional reforms in the road building industry ( EC@@ U 1.3 million ) .
the project will address the technical considerations of road construction and maintenance -@@ techniques that Belarus can adopt to build roads that match European standards .
this project also helps to upgrade wholesale and retail marketing and d@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion systems .
in addition , two major projects were started in 1994 , each worth EC@@ U 1 million .
these are intended to support agricultural production increases through the provision of market information and the start @@@ -@@ @ up of two pilot projects to help underpin the expansion of fla@@ x production .
the current state of the country 's enterprise sector is the focal point for widespread T@@ ac@@ is support .
this rise , however , is due more to the substantial drop in industrial output than any markedly improved performance in the agricultural sector .
based on this , T@@ ac@@ is cooperation has been mobil@@ ised to support developments in agriculture and the food supply chain .
the Georgian Government is accelerating the privatisation process and T@@ ac@@ is is backing this by ensuring the continuity of work in crucial areas .
in particular , this involves establishing an environment in which private business can thrive and continue to build a source of tax revenues and hard currency .
towards the end of 1994 , the Government proposed an economic policy for Georgia , covering structural policies and financing needs .
it highlighted recent laws that should accelerate privatisation efforts and strengthen the focus on government reform and private sector development .
public administration reform and the framing of effective social policies are critical to the realisation of productive economic change .
a comprehensive education and train ing Is considered essential to stimulate this process , which is being provided within the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
this funding will be applied to widen the support offered by the SM@@ E Development Agency and Business Communication Centre in Tbilisi - established with support from the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
the opening of an additional support agency in Kut@@ a@@ isi is an integral element within this scheme .
the European Commission opened a Delegation in Tbilisi in 1994 .

a project was initiated in 1994 to help the Kazakh Ministry of Education establish a modern higher education system appropriate for the future human resources requirements of Kazakhstan .
T@@ AC@@ IS support for this scheme totals EC@@ U 7@@ 00,000 .
also within the educational sector , a plan to strengthen the training capacity of the Kazakh State Academy of Management and three provincial training centres received EC@@ U 2.@@ 33 million .
within the human resources sector , T@@ ac@@ is has focused on public administration reform , both by training individuals and providing policy advice to government .
T@@ AD@@ S has also supported the teaching of economics and management .
the second objective is to raise the standard of living of producers and consumers and contribute to the balanced development of the Kyrgyz economy .
there is also an urgent need to reform the country 's civil service and to upgrade policy formulation .
T@@ AC@@ IS is therefore lending considerable support to human resource development initiatives .
increased prices for energy imports have been accompanied by a drastic fall in living standards - at least 70 per cent of the population is living below the Government 's no@@ tional poverty line .
energy is therefore one of the main components of the T@@ ac@@ is programme for the country .
good progress was made until the end of 1993 with regard to structural reform , when implementation began to slow .
T@@ AC@@ IS has committed support worth EC@@ U 1.4 million for the development of a national energy strategy .
this will centre on the need for organisational restructuring and the establishment of an adequate legal and regulatory framework .
T@@ AC@@ IS support to Kyrgyzstan came fully on stream In 1994 , with support focusing on
• food production , processing and distribution • energy • human resource development .
another major project ( EC@@ U 1.1 million ) is now underway .

in addition , the Mongolian Centre for Scientific and Technological Information will be receiving T@@ ac@@ is finance to upgrade an education @@@ -@@ @ oriented information system .
European Community involvement with Mongolia was enhanced in 1994 when the country became a formal T@@ ac@@ is partner .
the year was characterised by the establishment of the necessary operational framework to support the planned series of T@@ ac@@ is activities .
major emphasis is being placed on the need to develop the full potential of human resources , which is critical to the achievement of an efficient market economy in Mongolia .
enterprise restructuring is another area where there is scope for future collaboration to increase the economic contribution of SMEs , especially those within the ag@@ ro@@ industry sector .
a number of T@@ ac@@ is programmes are now being pursued in both these areas .

the overall trend of the Russian economy continued to be unclear in 1994 .
on one side , the economy worsened , with inflation rising sharply following the collapse of the rouble in October .
capital investment also fell by 26 per cent during the year .
however , on the other side , preliminary figures for 1994 suggest that the fall in output has come to an end .
since autumn 1994 , real GDP and industrial production have started to grow after several years of decline : industrial production in the last quarter was five per cent higher than during the same period in 1993 .

the prospect of macro@@ econom@@ ie stabil@@ isation became more elusive .
over the past three years the country has undoubtedly made substantial progress towards establishing a market economy in terms of both liber@@ alisation and structural reforms .
however , the creation of an adequate legislative and institutional framework has slowed down recently and there Is little evidence to date of real enterprise restructuring .
official unemployment reached 7.1 per cent of the working population by the end of the year , a rise of 1.6 per cent over the year .
in addition , 6.4 per cent of the workforce is either on involun@@ tary leave or on a shorter working week .
the financial position of the Russian Federation deteriorated in 1994 .
the consolidated budget deficit in 1994 was 9.@@ 9 per cent of GDP .
however , Russia 's large trade surplus changed little in 1994 , with growth in merchandise exports balancing a rise m imports .
exports to non @@@ -@@ @ Commonwealth of Independent States countries increased by nearly 28 per cent in real terms , whereas the volume of trade with Commonwealth of Independent States countries decreased .
conflicting signs emerged on structural reform .

agricultural privatisation has been slow and food pricing and distribution are controlled by the state , although limited privatisation of the retail sector is under review .
a further EC@@ U 1.7 million has been allocated to fund an expert study for farming techniques employed in the production of cere@@ al crops .
with T@@ ac@@ is support , this objective is being progressively achieved .
in order to maxim@@ ise the effectiveness of T@@ AD@@ S in Turkmenistan , the Programme concentrates on three main areas .
• food production , processing and distribution • enterprise restructuring and development • human resources development .

help for small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) is a strategic economic imperative .
the development of the economy and sustained reform relies heavily on developing people 's skills .
the support of the T@@ ac@@ is Programme is focused primarily on establishing modern management structures and practices in the civil service .
the restructuring and privatisation of businesses is essential to make the enterprise sector a more powerful driving force in the country 's programme of economic regeneration .
a scheme was Intro@@ duc@@ ed In December 1994 which will re@@ organise those enterprises un@@ suitable for mass privatisation .
these are organisations that need profound restructuring , new investment , new technology , a different product portfolio and expanded export markets .
T@@ AC@@ IS cooperation covers the provision of expert consultancy for framing and implementing business plans .
EC@@ U 2.2 million has been made available to support this scheme ( which also covers Azerbaijan ) , administered through a Management Ad@@ vice and Service Facility structure .
until recently , the T@@ ac@@ is Programme for Ukraine was managed from Brussels .

further improvement in the programme is anticipated following a review , carried out in 1994 , of the previous three years ' programmes .
this has helped to Identi@@ fy a number of areas where improvements can be made in the preparation and implementation of projects , and these will be Intro@@ duc@@ ed In@@ to the 1995 programme .

the T@@ ac@@ is budget for the national programmes with Ukraine in 1994 tot@@ alled EC@@ U 5@@ 0.5 million .
Ukraine 's heavy industries , until recently strongly dependent on the defence sector , are un@@ wiel@@ dy , inefficient and require major restructuring .
state enterprises in general continue to require substantial subsidies .
the medium to long @@@ -@@ @ term solution to this problem centres on accelerating the privatisation process and the creation of a thriving enterprise sector - objectives which are accorded high priority in the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
the country 's balance of payments position remains resolutely negative - reflecting Ukraine 's bureaucratic and fiscal constraints on exports and massive energy imports .
energy issues are key to Ukraine 's economic prospects and substantial T@@ ac@@ is funding is allocated to projects in this sector .
in this context , T@@ ac@@ is ' contribution to the G7 / European Union Action Plan aiming at the rapid closure of Chernobyl ¡ s a key element of reform In the energy sector .
to support the programme of privatisation and industrial reform , a series of actions were agreed or initiated in 1994 .
this region of Ukraine also provides the focus for a project conceived to support privatisation and restructuring plans .
the conservation of grain stocks has historically posed a problem for Ukrainian cere@@ al farmers , due to poor storage facilities and practices .
a further T@@ ac@@ is initiative launched In 1994 offers support to farmers in the Zapor@@ y@@ z@@ hy@@ e region .
amounting to EC@@ U 1.9 million , this project reinforces privatisation efforts within the region 's important sun@@ flower farming sector .
in 1994 , T@@ ac@@ is supported the establishment of the school to ensure the provision of quality training for the personnel who will have to deal with the new procedures .

detailed discussions were held with Ukrainian Ministry of Power and Elec@@ tri@@ fication officials in the course of 1994 .
in this sector , T@@ ac@@ is is concentrating on public administration reform , strengthening of management training for managers , reform of the employment services and the retraining of military officers .

in January , a presidential decree concerning economic reform declared that the pace of privatisation and price liber@@ alisation would accelerate .
a major project was initiated in 1994 offering support for a Market Sk@@ ills Development Centre ( EC@@ U 3.6 million ) .
T@@ AC@@ IS addresses the following activities :

in 1994 , a number of actions were completed or set In motion .
one such initiative in operation which began in March 1994 , is directed at offering support services to farmers in their transition to private farming in the Gu@@ li@@ stan and Fer@@ gan@@ a ob@@ lasts ( EC@@ U 3 million ) .
this integrated development programme will prepare both private and state concerns for the advent of a free market economy .
the experience gained In this exercise will be shared with other regions and districts .
the diversification of agricultural production away from cotton , the development of food@@ processing and packaging capabilities and the development of exports are priorities in the agricultural sector .
many of the problems that the New Independent States are facing require cooperative solutions .
T@@ AC@@ IS is a catalyst for greater cooperation between the partner countries and has set up a number of Multi@@ country programmes .

the 1994 Multi@@ country programme , with a T@@ ac@@ is financial allocation of EC@@ U 47 million , was approved by the Commission in November 1994 .
in 1995 , T@@ AD@@ S Multi@@ country programmes will place particular emphasis on networks ( transport , energy and telecommunications ) and environment .
major Multi@@ country programmes are outlined below .
nuclear safety programme
the nuclear safety programme is the largest single T@@ ac@@ is programme .
it is fully in line with the G7 Action Programme adopted In 1992 at the G7 summit In Munich .
in 1994 , the R@@ BM@@ K Safety Review was presented by a consortium of European Union organisations .

it will concentrate on promoting synergies and coordination between various projects , to maxim@@ ise the effectiveness of the programme in Russia .
policy and legal advice programme
the policy and legal advice programme provides short@@ term advice on macroeconomic , economic and social policy , restructuring , institution building , and drafting of legislation .
the programme launches short@@ term projects involving high @@@ -@@ @ level decision @@@ -@@ @ making bodies in the New Independent States .
support to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS )
in particular the Democracy Programme seeks to support the activities and efforts of nongovernmental bodies .
the programme Is jointly managed by Ph@@ are and T@@ AD@@ S .
its funding amounted to EC@@ U 4 million in 1994 .
the programme Is based on networking of universities from the European Community and the New Independent States .
in 1994 , Belarus , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Moldova , Russia , Ukraine and Uzbekistan participated in T@@ ac@@ is T@@ emp@@ us .
the main instruments of the programme are joint European projects .
the transition process in the countries of the former Soviet Union Is well underway .
since It is a dynamic process It is necessary for T@@ AD@@ S to adapt to ensure that the support it offers reflects the needs of the partner countries .
similarly , providing limited Investment support through the financing of certain small Infrastructure projects for cross@@ border schemes Is an option .
such support would only be used where It supports follow @@@ -@@ @ up activities for T@@ AD@@ S projects .
T@@ AC@@ IS management has also reviewed the basis for determining the Programme 's sectoral allocations .
one area concerns establishing an overall multi @@@ -@@ @ annual financial framework .
the problems which the current an n@@ ual budget allocation cause have been covered earlier in this report .
providing some assurance of continuity of funding would make the current multi @@@ -@@ @ annual programming process more effective and improve T@@ ac@@ is ' overall efficiency .
this is particularly important given the Initi@@ atives of the T@@ ac@@ is partner countries to re @@@ -@@ @ establish economic links to foster sustainable development .
furthermore , it is important to under@@ line respect for democratic principles , human rights and economic re forms as a condition for T@@ ac@@ is support .
another area for consideration concerns the need to provide support in the important area of the development of small businesses .
unlike Ph@@ are , the T@@ ac@@ is Initiative did not allow for the provision of equity funding .
however , if the T@@ ac@@ is initiative proves successful , providing equity capital for joint ventures is an option which could be developed .

for 1994 , T@@ ac@@ is payments reached 100 per cent of EC@@ U 300@@ .@@ 3 million bud@@ geted .
as part of the T@@ AD@@ S programming process , there are three steps which take the annual budget approved by the European Parliament through to the point where projects are implemented and funds disbur@@ sed .
Contracting - The conclusion of contracts for the implementation of the agreed projects contained in the T@@ ac@@ is Action Program@@ mes marks the start of implementation on the ground .
T@@ AC@@ IS signed about 1,@@ 300 contracts in 1994 .
as a general rule , service contracts over EC@@ U 300,000 are awarded through restricted ten@@ dering procedures .
the average size of a contract is about EC@@ U 400,000 .
this takes place over the length of the project , which can be up to three years .
in 1994 T@@ ac@@ is made about 2,@@ 700 payments .
commitment - The design of financing proposals for Action Program@@ mes is the basis for the commitment of funds .
once a financing proposal has received the favourable opinion of the T@@ ac@@ is Committee , the relevant funds associated with that proposal are committed by the Commission .
T@@ AC@@ IS must commit its entire annual budget In the calendar year to which that budget applies .
un@@ committed money is cancelled .
the T@@ AD@@ S Programme greatly increased its payment level in 1994 .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
in its first five years of operation , 1991 -@@ 1995 , T@@ ac@@ is has committed EC@@ U 2,@@ 26@@ 8 million to launch more than 2,@@ 200 projects .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the impact of these projects is not limited to the narrow geographical area in which they were implemented .
results will also benefit organisations and individuals in other regions .

in this context , the project implemented a complete set of training documents mainly dedicated to large industries .
the present " Manual on sales practices " is an adaptation to SM@@ E sector of the " Sales training hand@@ book " prepared by the mentioned proj@@ ec@@ t@@ 1 .
this document attempts to simplify the task of NIS companies as they set up efficient sales force management by clari@@ fying their ideas on the subject and by indicating met@@ h ­ ods for reaching their objectives .
( 1 ) This brochure is based on the " Sales training hand@@ book " submitted by AT K@@ ear@@ ney to@@ EC / T@@ ac@@ is@@ in 1996 .
selling is a market@@ ing@@ 1 task that usually involves face @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ face contact with a cus ­ tom@@ er .
this two @@@ -@@ @ way communication means that the seller can identify the buyer 's specific need and tailor the sales presentation in the light of this knowledge .
effectiveness and efficiency of the sales force have a crucial impact on the company 's success .
sales people represent their company to customers and to society in general .
opinions on the firm and its products are formed on the basis of impressions made by these PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E in their work .
sales@@ men operate with little direct supervision .
many people 's perception of a sales@@ man is that of a sl@@ ick , fast @@@ -@@ @ talking confidence trick ­ ster forcing unwanted products on innocent customers .
as usual , perceptions do not completely match reality , especially in view of educated consumers and professional buyers .
a sales@@ person 's primary responsibility is to increase sales .
the sales@@ man 's task will differ according to the nature of the products , the complexity of the technology , the company 's size , the existing distribution channels , ( Figure 1 ) .
selling a huge chemical plant obviously involves a far more complex approach than selling E@@ DI ­ B@@ LE oil .

approach
this research is a prerequisite for tail@@ oring pres@@ en ­ tations to prospects , approaching decision @@@ -@@ @ makers and increasing a sales@@ man 's conf@@ i ­ dence when approaching a prospective buyer .
six basic methods of approach , outlined below , may be considered and used .
it is obviously necessary to have a sub ­ stanti@@ al knowledge of the product and of the prospect 's needs .
the buyer will appreciate the fact that the sales@@ person is taking the problem seriously and the sales@@ person will gain by having a clear and full understanding of what the problem really is .
throughout the selling process the sales@@ man has one goal in mind : to secure the order .
the key to concluding a sale is to look for specific verbal buying signals .
figure 4 : effective conclusion of sale
As@@ su@@ mp@@ tive conclusion
" which of these models would you prefer ? "
" exactly when would you need this article ? "
'@@ To what address shall we deliver this ? "
• " Beg@@ in to measure space for machines , floor or wall cover@@ ings "
" will three dozen be enough , or should I send you four ? "
" when can our engineers talk with your machine operators ? "
this technique has the effect of maintaining the relationship between the par ­ ties and can be used as the starting point for the discussion when they next meet .
once the order has been placed , sound follow @@@ -@@ @ up is the next prerequisite In order to ensure satisfied customers and additional business .
• additional business satisfied customers
• references for future prospects
• being present at the time of delivery or calling soon after to ensure that customer is satisfied with purchase
the sales management process is divided into three main components : planning , Implementation , Performance Evaluation and Control .
these components have to be seen as a continuous and interdependent process .
figure 6 : three components of sales management process
performance evaluation and control
all planning must begin by forecasting market demand .
the level of sales a company can expect can only be derived from an analysis of the market as a whole : the achievable sales potential must be compatible with the company 's goals , capabilities and resources .
• Marketing plan ­ Is the goal liquid@@ ate inventory ?
aggressively increase market share ?
• Production capacity ­ Too limited to achieve full sales potential ?
1 during a specific time period
• Financial resources ­ A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate to finance necessary production , marketing , distribution , etc . ?
establishing sales territories and providing for their effective coverage is a key part of strategic sales planning for large and medium ­ sized firms .
the sales potential in a territory is more important than its geographical size .
in designing sales territories , the ideal goal is to achieve equality in both sales potential and sales ­ men 's work load .
figure 8 : territorial build @@@ -@@ @ up for intensive distribution
( 1 ) For more information on segm@@ entation process , please refer to the T@@ DP brochure " Manual on marketing practices . "

calculate Number of territories needed = Sales potential + Aver@@ age volume per sales@@ man
modify the tentative territories as needed , thus fin@@ alizing the process
this method is especially popular with manufacturers of industrial products .
implementation
save time , save money !
management of territorial coverage also involves routing the sales people and managing their time .
with scheduling , the firm sets up a system to aid in planning , executing and reporting on sales contacts to make more effective use of a sales@@ person 's time .
routing helps to reduce travel expenses by ensuring orderly and thorough cover of the market .
figure 10 : planning sales visit in advance
plan for the coming week should be prepared by the middle of the current week .
plan 60 % of daily workload before noon . allow for necessary travel time .
sales@@ men should follow three rules for routing ( Figure 11 ) :
customers located near a section of this perimeter can be combined and visited in a special tour .
figure 11 : perimeter routing , a rational method to plan routes
• The connecting routes should produce the blun@@ test angles possible .
implementation of the strategic marketing plan will depend to a large degree on the choice of sales personnel .
a good selection improves sales force performance , pro ­ mo@@ tes cost savings and facilitates other management tasks ( Figure 12 ) :
figure 12 : major activities when selecting sales people
the staff@@ ing PRO@@ CE@@ SS
determine job description
hire and assimil@@ ate new people into sales function
sales training can bring a variety of benefits such as improved time management , lower selling costs and improved customer relations .
sales@@ people also need to be trained in the management of long term customer relationships as well as context @@@ -@@ @ specific selling skills .
the sales force manager should develop an individual skill building programme for the members of the sales force in relation with their existing strengths and weaknesses and his or her target skills .
it is important not only that sales@@ men be motivated , but that their efforts be chann@@ elled in a way that is consistent with the strategic marketing plan .
the three conditions to mo@@ ti ­ v@@ ate and enhance performance are value , a transparent remuneration system and attain@@ ability .
effective motivation is also based on a good understanding of sales people as individuals , their personalities and value systems .
in a sense , sales managers do not motivate sales people : they ensure the conditions for sales people to motivate themselves .
quotas
sales quotas translate planning activities into work planning goals and assignments .
three general approaches are usually used to set quotas . 1 .
quotas are set in conjunction with territorial potential . 2 .
quotas are set in relation to the company 's forecast or market potential estimate for the total market .
figure 13 : quota type chosen by strategy criteria
• Pro - Most widely used - Can be based on revenue or number of units sold - Easy to calculate and understand
a firm must determine both the level and the method of paying its sales force .
incentives are not gifts .
they represent the integration of the sales@@ man in the company 's project .
the job description should serve as the starting point for designing a sales compens@@ a ­ tion plan : what services and abilities is the company paying for ?
a company 's order processing system should seek to avoid unnecessary written doc@@ u ­ ments and repetition of the same information processing activities .
moreover , it should achieve a rapid flow of information to the point from which the flow of goods is released .
all stages in order processing must be reviewed to ensure accurate and timely order ful ­ fil@@ ment .
figure 14 : order processing steps
preparation r
order processing includes several steps :
the transmission of an order depends largely on the method of order placement employed .
a typical method is to fill out stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed , pre ­ printed forms with the cus ­ tom@@ er .
long term , repeat customers may be supplied with pre ­ printed order forms , on which only the number of units ordered needs to be filled out .
not using or altering order forms necess@@ itates an extra trans@@ cription step .
this creates additional processing costs and an additional potential source of errors .
once received , the transmitted order must be adapted to the selling company 's internal requirements .
here preparation means checking for missing or incomplete information , checking price conditions , delivery modes and the customer 's paying ability .
preparation also comprises planning concerning the logistic system : it Is necessary to check whether the requested product is available in stock .
within the trans@@ cription , order information is used to prepare order confirmation and internal processing documents , including order delivery and shipping papers .
these documents can be supplemented with additional information after selection , such as weight , positioning and packaging .
shipping comprises the completion of shipping papers with freight , transport and time data , and the subsequent loading and transport of products triggered by this step .
invo@@ icing may be completed either after shipment preparation or in parallel with prep@@ a ­ r@@ ations for shipping .
23 saves time and postage costs .
the time required for order processing is a significant portion of delivery cycle time .
thus ration@@ alisation of order transmission and order processing can provide sub@@ stan ­ tial opportunities to reduce costs and delivery times .
performance evaluation and control
planning and performance evaluation are strategically interrelated and inter@@ de ­ pen@@ dent .
inadequate evaluation can neg@@ ate the value of strategic planning .
a sales management audit is used to evaluate the sales organisation , its poli ­ C@@ ies , personnel and performance .
sales volume trends are important indicators of sales performance .
figure 15 : study of sales data
trend in sales is far more important than sales volume in a given year Two trends are particularly important : trend of company sales over a period of years trend of company share of total industry market
the ongoing evaluation of individual sales performance is a vital component of a sales management audit .
it should combine qualitative and quantitative aspects .
the quantitative aspects can be sub@@ divided into out@@ put@@ - and input @@@ -@@ @ oriented results .
furthermore , qualitative per@@ for ­ man@@ ce evaluation comprises sales people 's knowledge of own and competitor 's pro@@ d ­ uc@@ ts , customers ' needs and the company 's policies and strategies .
their customer relations , personal appearance and health and their personality and attitu@@ d@@ inal factors , in terms of cooper@@ ati@@ veness , resour@@ c@@ efulness and analytic skills , should also be considered in effective performance evaluation .
here the sales manager should try not to lose sight of sales@@ man 's strengths by over@@ critic@@ ising minor faults .
how to improve SM@@ E sales force efficiency
most cost drivers can be turned into profit improvement levers :
customer classification helps set priorities for customer service and determine the ne@@ c ­ ess@@ ary frequency of sales visits .
how to improve SM@@ E sales force efficiency
figure 16 : customer structure analysis
the customer structure analysis ( ABC analysis ) uses the following potential criteria : • current sales volume • size of orders • combination of size and frequency of orders • level of competition for the customer • potential sales volume • frequency of orders • profitability / ability to pay
reducing personnel turnover and Im@@ proving sales force morale are also typical levers for profit improvement .

management must consider many factors in the decision , including sales force abilities , market and customer considerations , nature of product and the demands of the selling job .
every method of attribu@@ ting responsibility has Its benefits and drawbacks .
the most widely used system for attribu@@ ting responsibility and line authority for sales operations is geographical speci@@ alisation .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .

this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the projects described here@@ after .
various T@@ ac@@ is projects have worked / are working on the re@@ organisation of dairy farming in NIS countries .
this brochure analyses the problems of low milk production in various NIS countries .
it provides farmers with technical recommendations for a low cost and efficient animal feeding system based on for@@ age production and herd management .
the current transition phase , from the former centr@@ alised and highly subsi@@ dis@@ ed system to a free market economy , has a strong influence on the development of the milk sector throughout the NIS countries .
everywhere , the milk sector has to face a competitive mar ­ K@@ et with an infrastructure which has been implemented for a very different context .
the situation of dairy farming is far from satisfactory .
a continuous fall in milk production is the normal result of such a situation .
dairy farms have to effect a complete re@@ organisation at each step of the milk production chain , with a view to making it more profitable , that is more efficient and more pro@@ du@@ c ­ tive .
solutions exist , in particular through a complete change in the traditional re@@ aring process .
they are based on improved management and feeding of the cattle , in par@@ tic@@ u ­ L@@ ar on the basis of for@@ age @@@ -@@ @ based feeding , as a low cost substitute for concentrates that are both very expensive and difficult to obtain .
several T@@ ac@@ is projects , in different countries and climatic areas have worked on re@@ organ ­ isation with a view to improving the profitability of dairy farming through improved for@@ age production and better care of the animals .
most of the projects have achieved positive results .
following various economic considerations on the milk sector , this brochure presents the T@@ ac@@ is experience for implementing a profitable dairy farming .
the pilot projects and the recommendations for re@@ organisation of the livestock @@@ -@@ @ re@@ aring and feeding systems are based on scientific principles of animal nutrition , developed by IN@@ RA ( National Institute for Agr@@ onom@@ ic Research - France ) .
Annex 4 provides a summary of these principles .
efficient dairy farming : higher mil@@ k@@ production and healthy cows .
explained in the annex and in the glos@@ sary at the end of this brochure .
there are wide differences in milk production figures and in cattle feeding and manage ­ ment systems in EU and NIS countries .
EU dairy farms : 20 to 200 cows .
NIS dairy collective farms : 200 to 2,000 cows .
today , small dairy farms ( those with an output of less than 100,000 l / dairy farm / year ) are becoming rare .
most dairy farms now have an output of between 200,000 and 2,@@ 000,000 l / dairy farm / year ( i.e. from 20 to 200 cows ) .
large in size ( 200 to 2,000 cows ) , collective farm dairy herds are housed in large cow sheds holding from 100 to 600 cows .
responsibilities are highly segm@@ ented with very few linkages between the various activities ( fodder crop production , feeding , mil@@ king , selection , economic analysis ) .
output is often below 2,000 lit@@ res / cow / year .
above all this phenomenon is due to animal hus@@ band@@ ry systems that are not profitable .
the annual milk output of these collective farms ( covering 4,000 ha , on average ) varies from 400,000 to 4,@@ 000,000 l / dairy farm / year .
cows privately owned by collective farm workers
a dairy complex with 400 cows in Siberia .
dairy farming is practically non @@@ -@@ @ existent among private farmers because of the poor pr@@ of ­ itability of the activity : few have been motivated to start this type of farming and most of those who set up faced serious difficulties .
milk output per cow in EU countries is currently an average of two to three times higher than that of NIS countries .
over the last fifteen years , milk output has significantly increased in the main EU pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion areas .
despite wide regional disparities , average annual milk output is 5,000 l / cow in the EU .
in France , which is one of the leading European producers , along with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , average production is 5,@@ 600 l / cow / year .
comparisons of milk output in the EU and the NIS come up against the problems of available and reliable statistics for NIS countries .
on average , annual milk output in the NIS ranges between 1,500 and 2,500 l / cow .
regarding trends , it can be observed that output increased until the end of the eigh@@ ties and that this growth was a result of large state subsidies awarded to buy concentrates to compensate for the poor quality of the cattle fodder .
the reduction or cessation of state subsidies at the beginning of the n@@ ine@@ ties has led to dairy farms becoming depleted of capital and to a fall in production in most regions of the NIS .
productivity levels on livestock farms in the European Union and in the NIS are very different .

Russia , the Ukraine ) . ( * * ) Inclu@@ ding the for@@ age production for cattle feeding .
animal feeding and re@@ aring systems
the differences in output in EU and NIS can be explained by the cattle feeding and re@@ aring systems used .
the principal reason for the regular increase in milk production in the EU is a result of the Im@@ pro@@ vement In feeding conditions which preceded genetic improvements .
quality cattle fodder ( without concentrates ) alone , can ensure an output of 25 I of milk / day per cow or , in other words , over 6,000 l / year .
fuel consumption for for@@ age production is very high in the NIS : 200 to 400 l / ha com ­ pa@@ red to 50 to 100 l / ha in the EU .
in the NIS countries studied , the management system of the agricultural production led the people responsible for agriculture to neglect the quality of the fodder and its nutrition ­ al efficiency .
the con ­ centr@@ ates were transported over great distances ( cereals from Kazakhstan , sun@@ flower cake from the Ukraine , etc . ) and distributed to livestock farms as state subsidies .
fodder crop production was intensively mechan@@ ised and fuel provided at artificially low price by the state .
the segm@@ entation of farms into separate activities ( farming , cattle breeding , mechan@@ isa ­ tion and management ) did not make it possible to improve the situation .
the large size of the herds , the lack of training or profit @@@ -@@ @ sharing incentives for the workers have not fav@@ oured the search for solutions to improve the productivity and profitability of the dairy farms .
the Agricultural Research Centre , utterly removed from reality in the field , has been unable to propose any alternatives to the new economic situation .
a few rare , still subsi@@ dis@@ ed farms exceed 6,000 l / cow / year but this is at the price of a massive and costly use of grain ( more than 2,000 kg / cow / year ) .
milk " purchasing power " expressed as the quantity of inputs needed for output is very weak .
the inputs ( cereals , fuel , etc . ) used to produce milk have a disproportionately high cost in relation to the price of the milk .
cost ratio for inputs in the NIS / EU
low consumer purchasing power in the NIS countries prohibits increases in the selling price of milk except in rare cases where collective farms are located close to major con ­ su@@ mption centres ( Moscow , St Petersburg ) .
on the other hand , to increase milk pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion output and profitability , it is necessary to re@@ organise the cattle re@@ aring and feeding systems so that less cere@@ al and less fuel are used .
high dairy production costs
due to the poor quality of the gra@@ zing past@@ ure ( 300 to 600 F@@ UL@@ V@@ ha . / year ) , where it exists , it is necessary to provide the animals with large quantities of machine harvested fodder crops .
the mechanical requirements needed to produce , harvest and transport virtually all of their food requirements are huge .
in the majority of NIS countries , animal feed relies on a production system that is very expensive in terms of inputs ( fuel , mechan@@ isation , concentrates ) .
the fodder crop production system in the NIS countries continues to for@@ sake the use of grass for gra@@ zing ( except in the Baltic region ) .
faced with serious financial difficulties since the beginning of the n@@ ine@@ ties , the state has either greatly reduced or stopped the subsidies .
they are often between 2 and 10 months late in paying for the products provided by the farms ( milk , meat , cereals ) .
consequently , the farms are practically incapable of functioning .
these problems have been and continue to be frequently aggravated by inflation .
cereals for dairy cows in Siberia .
confronted with serious financial difficulties , collective farms often had no other alter@@ na ­ tive than to sell off portions of their farm capital .
depletion of farm capital
indeed , on these farms , most of the cereals are given to the cattle owing to the poor nutritional quality of the for@@ age and therefore C@@ AN@@ NOT be used to generate cash income .
the phenomenon of farm capital depletion , especially in recent years , has mechan@@ ically led to falling milk production on collective farms .
the curve ( 1 ) reflects the trend in average milk output per cow observed in the countries of the NIS .
it represents an annual average output of 1,500 to 2,500 lit@@ res / cow .
the curve ( 2 ) corresponds to the output that is theoretically possible given the genetic Po@@ ten ­ tial of these animals .
the area between the two curves represents the output deficit of the cows .
this un@@ realised potential is equivalent to a loss of 2,000 to 3,000 lit@@ res / cow / year , a loss due primarily to an extremely poor diet that is both difficult to digest and unbalanced .
in NIS countries the fodder is usually left in the open air for a long time causing aerob@@ ic fermentation to occur ( the p@@ H rises to between 6 and 7 ) which is not conducive to good preservation .
after filling , the sil@@ o is covered over with straw ( not naturally air or water@@ tight ) and then with earth .
plastic she@@ eting is not used to cover the sil@@ os because it is too expensive .
those responsible are not aware of the considerable losses ( 40 to 60 % ) that occur in the piles of sil@@ age .
this is the reason why the cere@@ al value is only account ­ ed for at 30 to 50 % of its market price .
the basic ration ( intake only comprising fodder crops ) is not AD@@ E ­ qu@@ ate to cover their production requirements .
consequently , production is poor since it is totally reli@@ ant on the bodily reserves of the animal and the proportion of concentrates in the feed intake .
► Summer feed is insufficient The cows are exhausted by their winter milk production which has drained their body reserves and when they are put out to grass in May they must first of all restore their reserves .
figure 2 : distribution of cal@@ vings in a year
the disparity in milk production between the winter ( December ) and the summer ( June ) is often between 300 % and 500 % in NIS countries , compared with 30 % in the dairy regions of Western Europe .
this phenomenon not only affects the total quantity of milk produced but also the profitability of the dairy output and the costs of processing dairy products .
in effect , neither an enhancement in the milk quality nor a sound level of profitability in the d@@ ai@@ ries can be guaranteed .
in summer , the processing factories receive plenty of milk and sometimes too much in relation to their processing capacity .
some private d@@ ai@@ ries have begun to increase their prices in winter in order to motivate producers to produce milk during this period .
but the state enterprises do not have these financial possibilities .
following the withdrawal of state intervention at the start of the n@@ ine@@ ties , cere@@ al yields everywhere have declined even in the very rich " cher@@ no@@ z@@ em " regions of Russia and the Ukraine .
insufficient cere@@ al production in the NIS is forcing prices upwards .
imports from world markets are on the increase and are a drain on foreign exchange reserves .
world cere@@ al stocks being low , world cere@@ al prices are rising ste@@ eply .
the feed deficit is becoming steadily worse throughout the NIS .
of primary con ­ CER@@ N is Russia .
the Ukraine , on the contrary , achieves the self @@@ -@@ @ sufficiency threshold in feed cereals but prefers to sell its stocks outside the NIS for reasons of foreign exchange income .
Belarus has a structural surplus of dairy products .
a comparative analysis of the situation in several representative NIS climatic regions
the real costs of production could not be precisely determined because of the extremely complex accounting system in practice in the NIS and ignorance of certain principles .
collective farms are not yet fully autonomous in their production strategy
under the former politi@@ co @@@ -@@ @ economic system , dairy farming was imposed on practically all the collective farms .
in some cases , the administration still opposes reductions in livestock even if there are too many animals in relation to the for@@ age land available and even if they are hardly ( or not at all ) productive .
everywhere there is land that C@@ AN@@ NOT be mechan@@ ised ( f@@ ens , irregular valleys , etc . ) or that has become bar@@ ren .
family production exists everywhere
" black Holstein " cows in the Leningrad oblast .
this is represented almost exclusively by the cows belonging to collective farm workers ( 300 to 600 families , including retired people per collective farm ) .
this herd is missing from official statistics and voluntarily minim@@ ised by the administration .
these " cattle breeders " are hostile to any change because this type of farming is possible with almost no expenditure or investment .
any new genetic investment would be useless within the present feeding pattern .
thus , it can be concluded that the genetic capacity of both the collectively and privately owned dairy cows is in the region of 4,000 and 6,000 lit@@ res of milk / cow / year .
not enough attention is given to past@@ ure .
gra@@ zed past@@ ures on collective farms ( when they exist ) are above all considered as walking areas .
they are never considered as the basis for the summer feed .
the cattle stoc@@ king rate there is constant and disproportionate ( e.g. : 40 ha for 300 cows against 40 ha for 40 to 60 cows in the European Union ) .
the productive and pal@@ atable flora ( r@@ ye@@ grass and white clo@@ ver ) have disappeared owing to poor farming con ­ di@@ tions .
these plants have been replaced by useless and un@@ pal@@ atable we@@ eds ( d@@ and@@ eli@@ ons , d@@ ai@@ sies , ger@@ ani@@ ums , whe@@ at@@ grass ) .
under these conditions complementary livestock feeding is a necessity .
gr@@ asses and leg@@ umes are only very occasionally associated .
these green fodder is harvested on distant fields ( sometimes 30 km away ) .
their yearly planting , harvest and transportation are very costly .
as intake they are hardly dig@@ esti@@ ble , bul@@ ky and deficient in energy and proteins and they have to be supplemented all through the gra@@ zing season with cereals .
conversely , cows belonging to the farm workers use the much more productive natural past@@ ure which has not been destroyed through over@@ stoc@@ king .
daily transportation of green fodder in the Leningrad region .
milk can only be produced on the basis of the protein and cere@@ al intake ( naturally poor in protein ) and the cows ' own bodily reserves ( which are often already reduced at the start of the winter ) .
conversely , cows owned privately by the farm workers receive the best ha@@ y , harvested in good time on land belonging to the collective farm , be@@ ets ( sugar or fodder varieties ) , cereals and pe@@ as taken from the collective farms .
the feed system in operation is costly In relation to the price of milk .
the animal hus@@ band@@ ry systems are both inefficient and unprofitable ; they are the cause of serious deficits on collective farms .
milk production is a principal cause of bankruptcy and depletion of farm capital on these collective farms especially since state subsidies have ceased .
the yield per cow stated in official statistics is generally overvalued
the Baltic h@@ inter@@ land and Baltic regions
the areas used for mixed farming and livestock re@@ aring are determined by the consider ­ able presence of f@@ ens , lakes and forests which represent more than 50 % of the total area ac@@ re@@ age .
in the St @@@ -@@ @ Petersburg region , colle@@ c ­ tive farms are relatively small ( 2,000 to 4,000 ha in total ) but they are often very stretched out , owing to the lakes and forests and this does not allow efficient explo@@ ita ­ tion of for@@ age areas .
a comparative analysis of the situation in several representative NIS climatic regions
in these two areas , dairy farming is an old and established occupation .
however , competition is lively from better quality and more attrac@@ tively packaged Finnish dairy products and the Finnish dairy imports make up for the current chronic deficit being experienced in the region .
unfortunately , UN@@ AT ­ trac@@ tive wages on collective farms have led to an exodus from rural areas by young people towards St @@@ -@@ @ Petersburg and a drop in the milk output per worker .
these were permanent or of very short rotation past@@ ures .
these two associated factors inevitably led to the disappearance of productive species and to their replacement by we@@ eds .
these past@@ ure lands disappeared 10 years ago but the collective farms are still very sen ­ sitive to the problem of efficient use of gra@@ zing grass .
a comparative analysis of the situation in several representative NIS climatic regions
the Tyumen region covers an area greater than that of Germany and France combined .
it has more forests than the whole of the European Union and under its soils are en@@ or ­ MO@@ Us reserves of oil and gas .
agricultural activity involves only a narrow strip in the south of the Oblast .
this plain without any relief is covered with forests , lakes and f@@ ens .
the better land has been cleared over the last fifty years .
collective farms found here are lar@@ g ­ er than in other regions ; they can reach up to 15,000 ha .
drought can occur in May / June accompanied by late fro@@ sts , as well as early night fro@@ sts ( in August ) .
generally , the climatic conditions are very well suited to grass growing between July and September but are un@@ suitable for making ha@@ y .
this region has many similarities with the " Baltic Region " : un@@ suitable soils for cere@@ al crops , a large amount of f@@ en@@ land , often heavy rainfall between July and September .
the best collective farms workers have chosen to go and work on the oil ri@@ gs in the North where the salaries are much more attractive .
the majority of those left behind are elderly which has a negative impact on the productivity of the dairy farms .
in five years , it has ( in head of cat ­ tle ) reached 70 % in some districts of the region .
dairy farming holds little attraction and very little effort is made to improve the past@@ ures .
electric fencing is un@@ heard of ; dairy her@@ ding is done on horse@@ back in the f@@ ens .
consequently the system of livestock re@@ aring has not been transformed and the real costs of production are very steep .
in the six@@ ties , all the land was put under cere@@ al crop cultivation which resulted in erosion and extreme and often irreversible degradation of the land .
successive serious droughts have occurred in this region ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 1996 ) which has wor@@ s ­ ened an already very critical situation for agriculture and dairy farming .
dairy farming is confined , during the summer to the valleys , the rav@@ ines and the f@@ ens .
the herds consist on average of about 200 to 300 cows .
in the winter , they are her@@ ded in to large dairy complexes holding 600 to 1,000 cows .
though hardly productive they at least consume the by @@@ -@@ @ products resulting from sugar processing .
this region enjoys a climate that is well suited to dairy farming ; the soils are less rich than those found in Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad and Kursk but the rainfall here is more abundant ( with 600 to 800 mm ) .
all grow vegetables in the open field and have fruit trees .
cere@@ al yields range from 50 to 70 Q@@ X / ha and for sugar be@@ et , it is between 30 to 50 tonnes / ha . these yields are usually among the best obtained in the Ukraine .
the per@@ ennial r@@ ye@@ grass and the white clo@@ ver ( hardly productive , wild varieties ) grow spontaneously everywhere .
the dairy cows consume bad quality machine harvested fodder all year long .
the basic herd is made up of " sim@@ mental " breed cows improved by blood from the " Mont@@ b@@ é@@ li@@ ard " breed over many years .
the current system for producing milk has been inherited from the Soviet economic sys ­ tem whose objective was not necessarily to make collective farms profitable .
transformation of the system of production in operation comes about by following a cer ­ tain number of technical recommendations .
the technical recommendations cover : • transformation of the for@@ age system • transformation of the cattle hus@@ band@@ ry system • transformation of the management system .
this production system must therefore require little machinery , fuel , fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er or plant pro ­ tec@@ tion products and investment is to be reduced .
choice of suitable for@@ age species
be careful in selecting for@@ age species .
the easiest successful association = r@@ ye@@ grass + white clo@@ ver .
► Produc@@ tivity Modern species of grass while being very productive ( 10 to 12 tonnes of dry matter / ha ) also require 300 to 400 kg of pure nitrogen in order to realise their production potential ( 2 tonnes of dry matter / ha without nitrogen ) .
modern species of leg@@ umes such as white clo@@ ver { Tri@@ fol@@ ium r@@ é@@ pens ) the " Lad@@ ino " or Hol@@ land@@ ic@@ um " varieties are able to produce 10 to 12 tonnes of DM / ha without nitrogen .
the easiest successful association to achieve is : per@@ ennial ry@@ e ­ grass ( PR@@ G ) + white clo@@ ver ; it is also the association which gives rise to the greatest pro ­ duction of milk per hectare .
in order to achieve this , late , more productive strains of PR@@ G must be used which are easier to crop at the right stage , ( see annex 1 : stages of fodder grass farming ) .
► Palat@@ ability The recommended most pal@@ atable grass is per@@ ennial r@@ ye@@ grass [ L@@ ol@@ ium per@@ enne ) .
it has the capacity , following a short trim@@ ming back ( either by gra@@ zing or cutting ) which destroys future ears during the shooting stage to only produce leaf@@ y fol@@ i@@ age .
or@@ ch@@ ard grass ( more resistant to drought but less pal@@ atable and dig@@ esti@@ ble ) has the same capacity .
tall f@@ es@@ cue , is more resistant to flooding but still less dig@@ esti@@ ble than or@@ ch@@ ard grass , and only pro ­ duc@@ es ears once a year .
Palat@@ ability and dig@@ esti@@ bility are closely linked .
a well managed past@@ ure can last many years .
the grass@@ lands ' per@@ enni@@ ality is closely linked at the same time to the climate , the species of for@@ age present and the method of grass@@ land farming ( explained below ) .
management exclusively by cutting inevitably leads to a reduction in productivity and to the disappearance of the plant .
it becomes extremely sensitive to frost .
establishment of new past@@ ures , till@@ age and s@@ ow@@ ings
establishing new past@@ ures is at the heart of changing the system of production .
► Ge@@ ographic location The available ac@@ re@@ age of the past@@ ures close to the cow sheds is non @@@ -@@ @ existent or very lim@@ -
often the only other alternative is to create new past@@ ures close to mil@@ king areas .
in this case , portable mil@@ king facilities have to be set up in the centre of the new summer past@@ ures .
nit@@ ro@@ genous fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er dressing is unnecessary because the white clo@@ ver provides the new past@@ ure with large quantities of nitrogen absorbed from the atmosphere ( 300 to 400 kg / ha / year ) .
the phosph@@ o @@@ -@@ @ pot@@ assic maintenance dressing is guaranteed by the livestock waste and also , moreover , by the man@@ ure ( maximum 20 ton@@ ne / ha ) put on all the iced soil .

pay as much attention to past@@ ures as to cows .
a good balance between the component parts ( 50 % of PR@@ G , 50 % of WC ) .
efficient use of the gra@@ zing will also guarantee the durability of the temporary past@@ ure over a period of 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 years while in the con@@ verse situation it would not last more than a year .
improving the sil@@ age
a bad sil@@ age gives bad feed even with good grass .
the sil@@ age made at the end of June beginning of July is often made under very bad con ­ di@@ tions .
constantly available clean water in the meadows .
sil@@ age making in a large capacity bun@@ ker sil@@ o ( 5,000 tonnes ) .
the fodder harvested and preserved under the previously described conditions has a high nutritional value .
the young fibre content is sufficient ( it varies between 19 to 26 % ) in order : • to avoid ac@@ id@@ osis ( the minimum of fibre is 16 % ) • to ensure the intestinal transit time .
for the cows to produce more than 25 lit@@ res / day , a supplementary energy and nitrogen contribution is needed .
the enhancement of the fodder produced in these new past@@ ures and of the intake is only possible if the herd is very well managed on a technical level .
as a priority it is necessary to analyse :
ster@@ ility rate At present , this rate is very high and very variable according to the season ( autumn cal@@ vings and early winter cal@@ vings 50 to 65 % ; end of winter cal@@ vings and spring cal@@ vings 15 % ) .
every non @@@ -@@ @ pregnant cow is considered to be ster@@ ile ( temporarily or defin@@ itively ) 110 days after cal@@ ving .
the goal is to have not less than 75 % cows of a herd pregnant within 110 days after an autumn or early winter cal@@ ving .
any delay in cal@@ ving is a loss of production .
the objective is to carry out the first in@@ sem@@ ination less than two months after the cal@@ ving ( 50 days on average ) .
the first o@@ e@@ str@@ us only happens when the cow Is in an acceptable physiological state and in a period of weight gain .
the objective is to have 365 days between cal@@ vings ( 1 year ) .
any improvement will require first and foremost training for personnel and an increase in people 's sense of responsibility .
with the Introduction of new feeding systems , the cows will be able to realise their gen@@ et ­ ic capacity .
in many regions , this is two to three times higher than the recorded pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion .
gra@@ zing on PR@@ G @@@ -@@ @ WC can provide in the climatic conditions and with the soils of the NIS between 15 to 35 tonnes of grass / ha / year , i.e. 3 to 6@@ 1. of dry matter / ha .
accounting for losses , that represents 2,500 to 5,000 F@@ u available / ha / year .
the milk produced under these feeding and farming conditions will vary from 3,000 to 6,000 lit@@ res / ha / year .
a certain number of productivity and profitability control ratios for the new for@@ age and livestock re@@ aring systems have to be calculated and analysed .
adaptation of the recommendations in various T@@ ac@@ is projects
the recommendations described above have been tested by T@@ ac@@ is over four years in three countries : Belarus ( Minsk ) ; Russia ( K@@ our@@ sk , Saint @@@ -@@ @ Petersburg , Tyumen ) and the Ukraine ( Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad , Cher@@ nov@@ tsi ) .
they take account of the specific characteristics that exist in each of these regions .
in the " Baltic h@@ inter@@ land " and the " Baltic " regions
in these regions well suited to livestock re@@ aring , two of the T@@ ac@@ is projects mentioned in this brochure applied the recommendations to achieve a more profitable system of milk production .
in the " Baltic " region the T@@ ac@@ is project was limited to the Lu@@ ga district ( Leningrad Oblast ) .
a dairy pilot project was implemented in Pol@@ ot@@ ch@@ any ( situated 90 km north of Minsk and 60 km from the frontier with Lithuania .
pilot project description The pilot action was developed on the 400 ha made available by the private sector F@@ arm@@ ers Association of G@@ ru@@ z@@ d@@ ovo .
the area intended for dairy farming ( 145 ha ) was cho ­ sen for its proximity to the buildings .
two grass@@ land species were selected for reasons of pal@@ at@@ ability , dig@@ esti@@ bility , of richness , of per@@ enni@@ ality and adaptation at the same time to gra@@ zing and cutting : PR@@ G and WC .

the " af@@ ila " pe@@ as were picked in preference to the very poor yielding and very difficult to harvest local giant pe@@ as .
the " af@@ ila " pe@@ as are very easy to harvest thanks to their ten@@ dr@@ ils and have very good yields .
associated with the be@@ et ( rich in energy ) , these pe@@ as that are rich in protein ( 22 % ) are perfectly suited for cows producing more than 25 lit@@ res of milk / day at the beginning of lac@@ tation .

in September and October , they were fed only on the gra@@ zing s@@ own at the end of April @@@ -@@ @ beginning of May .
the gra@@ zing consisted of fields closed using electric fencing .

the cows only spent one day on each of these fields .
the area of these fields was adapted daily to the amount of grass actually available ( 0.5 to 1.2 ha per day for the 100 cows ) .
gra@@ zing was stopped at the end of October because of the bearing capacity of the soil ( during the rainy period ) .
there was no second gra@@ zing on the past@@ ure fields at the begin ­ ning of September .
in December 1994 , this herd was fed at will ( 10 kg / day ) and ex@@ cl@@ u ­ sively on the sil@@ age of field pe@@ as @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ ats and with be@@ ets .
the average daily production of milk reached 17 lit@@ res of milk / day ( without using concentrates ) .
at the same time , their fellow cows that remained in the kol@@ kho@@ ze cow sheds produced no more than 3 lit@@ res of milk / day on average .

the " pilot project " in dairy farming was carried out in the " Nov@@ o@@ ie @@@ -@@ @ V@@ rem@@ ia " so@@ v@@ kho@@ z , 30 km to the east of Lu@@ ga .
" pilot project " framework The " Nov@@ o@@ ie @@@ -@@ @ V@@ rem@@ ia " so@@ v@@ kho@@ z provided a portion of the " Nov@@ o@@ ie @@@ -@@ @ Si@@ el@@ o " farm with 14@@ 6 ha of land situated around a cow shed holding 104 dairy cows .
after renew@@ ing this herd , it was intended to work towards the development of an autonomous " profit centre . "
it was decided to keep it and use it for sil@@ age and to provide gra@@ zing before the winter .

12 lit@@ res milk / day without concentrates against 7 l / milk / day for the rest of the herd .
the area of these fields varied from 1.8 to 3.5 ha for the 104 cows .
gra@@ zing stopped at the end of October 1994 because of the bearing capacity of the soil ( during the rainy period ) .
there was no second gra@@ zing on the fields under past@@ ure at the beginning of September .
during the same period , other cows in the so@@ v@@ kho@@ z were producing on average 7 lit@@ res of milk / day and receiving 2 kg of cere@@ al / cow / day .
" pilot project " framework A T@@ ac@@ is project was established in the region of Tyumen ( Russian Federation ) in July 1994 .
the project carried out a dairy farming pilot action .
the recommendations for introducing a more profitable system of milk production were applied on a so@@ v@@ kho@@ z in the surrounding area of Tyumen : P@@ lo@@ d@@ ov@@ o@@ i@@ é .
this so@@ v@@ kho@@ z had 2@@ 93 ha of land situated around a cow shed holding 380 dairy cows in very poor condition .
it was decided to reduce this number to 200 and to produce as much milk as possible by doubling the output per cow .
after having renewed this herd it was intended to set up an autonomous " Profit Centre . "
support of " the pilot project " The cultivated areas comprised of : • PR@@ G + WC for gra@@ zing ( under@@ see@@ ding of field pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ ats at the end of May 1996 ) : 280 ha .
these two grass@@ land species were chosen for the same reasons as in Belarus and Lu@@ ga .
results achieved during the project The field pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ at mix sil@@ age began ( 1 ) in mid @@@ -@@ @ August 1996 but was not used until the beginning of September 1996 ( 2 ) .
the average yield ( 280 ha ) was 13 tonnes / ha .
during these three weeks the development of the crop ( fall in the dig@@ esti@@ bility of the fibre ) was studied and the results are presented in the table below :

the fodder sugar be@@ et was mechan@@ ically harvested from the end of October 1994 and yielded 24 tonnes of roots per ha .
the dairy herd ( 200 cows planned ) The reduction of the dairy stock to 200 cows , eliminating the worst 180 had not been achieved by the end of the project .
it was envisaged that this first gra@@ zing would be carried out using the electric fencing from the autumn of 1996 .
the " Kas@@ k@@ ara " experimental fields Fi@@ f@@ teen for@@ age species or varieties ( Russian and western ) were compared according to the " l@@ atin square " device : four repeti@@ tions i.e. 60 experimental plots .
similar tests ( but without association ) have already been conducted on this farm in the past .
they clearly show that : • the PR@@ G and the WC withstand the Siberian winter • their yields are , even in this climate , very high and superior to those of the Russian selections .
in these regions that are entirely suited to cereals , two T@@ ac@@ is projects adopted the recommendations for a profitable system of milk production .
the project that ended in December 1995 covered the Kursk Oblast ( Russia ) , the second , which will finish at the end of 1997 , covers the Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad Oblast ( Ukraine ) .
the Kursk Oblast T@@ ac@@ is project ( Russian Federation )
K@@ our@@ chat@@ ov , 60 km to the south @@@ -@@ @ west of Kursk • the " First of May " kol@@ kho@@ z , comprising " le@@ ached brown forest " less fertile soils ( District of Kursk , 15 km to the north of Kursk ) .
during summer , the cows are divided into three groups : one remains on the farm , and each of the other two herds leave for the f@@ ens situated 10 km away from the complex and at a distance of 8 km apart from each other .
mobile mil@@ king facilities were set up on the two f@@ en@@ land sites .
the breakdown of the crops cultivated was as follows : • PR@@ G + WC ( for gra@@ zing , pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ o@@ at under@@ see@@ ding ) : 2@@ 95 ha • fodder sugar be@@ et : 30 ha .
the " First May " Kol@@ kho@@ z provided the pilot project with one of its two dairy herds living all year in the winter cow sheds ( 2 km apart ) .
the completely deteriorated past@@ ures , used only for st@@ rolling , were located in an area that C@@ AN@@ NOT be mechan@@ ised ( i.e. valley ) .
the 330 ha of land made available for the pilot project are situated around a cow shed hold ­ ing 20@@ 3 cows and were used entirely to establish new past@@ ures of PR@@ G + WC ( for Gra@@ z ­ ing , with pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ o@@ at under@@ see@@ ding ) .
planting of the new crops The sowing of PR@@ G + WC could begin in mid April and was completed by the end of April under@@ se@@ eded with field pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ ats under conditions as described above .
these s@@ ow@@ ings took place at the end of April 1995 and were we@@ eded with B@@ é@@ than@@ al Progress .
two mechan@@ i ­ cal ho@@ e@@ ings were carried out .
results achieved during the project 1995 was an extremely dry year and sil@@ age yields were extremely limited .
those be@@ ets with the deepest roots suffered less from the drought and took advantage of the rains from the end of August .
field pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ at mix sil@@ age was started at the beginning of July 1995 and provided 8 tonnes / ha at First May and 12 t . / ha at D@@ rou@@ z@@ no@@ ie .
the fodder be@@ ets were mechan@@ ically harvested from the end of 1995 and yielded 91 t. of roots / ha .
cows fed on the new past@@ ures produce 6 liters more than the herd fed in the traditional manner .
the gra@@ zing took place in fields " over@@ seen " by her@@ d@@ smen who were very reluctant about using electric fencing which they refused to set up .
in principle , the cows were only to spend on day on each of these fields ( 6 to 10 ha / day for 200 cows ) .
in reality , there was anarch@@ ical gra@@ zing and repeated gra@@ zing of the new past@@ ures by all of the other cows of the kol@@ kho@@ z which inevitably led to exhaustion and to the disappearance of the white clo@@ ver during the first winter .
adaptation of the recommendations in various T@@ ac@@ is projects
the Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad Oblast T@@ ac@@ is project ( Ukraine )
the Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad T@@ ac@@ is project started at the end of 1995 .
since the month of February 1996 , two milk production " pilot projects " were identified with two kol@@ kho@@ zes " K@@ olo@@ s " and " Ukra@@ in@@ ia " situated more than 100 km apart and from Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad .
the past@@ ures are located in an area that C@@ AN@@ NOT be mechan@@ ised ( i.e. a valley ) , are in a totally deteriorated condition and are used only for walking ( 40 ha / 200 cows ) .
the 210 ha of land made available to the pilot project are situated around one of the cow sheds with a capacity to hold 200 cows .
the land was used to establish new past@@ ures .
the land was used to create new past@@ ures .
the breakdown of the crops planted was the following : • PR@@ G + WC ( for gra@@ zing , under old al@@ fal@@ fa ) : 70 ha • PR@@ G + WC ( for gra@@ zing , under old beans ) : 110 ha .

the T@@ ac@@ is project of Cher@@ nov@@ tsi carried out a milk production " pilot project , " in particular with the " Mam@@ al@@ iga " kol@@ kho@@ z situated to the east of Cher@@ nov@@ tsi .
the bare @@@ -@@ @ earth see@@ ding of 26 ha of new past@@ ure in proximity to the cow sheds was possible at the end of July just after the wheat harvest .
in spring 1997 , it is envisaged that 71 ha of PR@@ G + WC will be s@@ own on the area currently planted with maize near the cow sheds .
these 97 ha should provide quality gra@@ zing grass for 100 cows housed in the nearby cow shed .

the contractor evaluated some of the T@@ ac@@ is projects one to two years after the technical assistance that had come to an end .
" Baltic " ( Leningrad Oblast - Lu@@ ga District )
this project ended in 1995 .
the past@@ ures created in Lu@@ ga in spring 1995 , are gra@@ zed using electric fencing exclusive ­ ly by the 104 cows of the former " pilot project . "
the fields closed by these electric fences are large ( 2 to 3 ha ) , the cows spend 3 to 4 days on them and return to the same field a month later .
the grass@@ land management recommendations have been globally under ­ stood and applied with the result that use of the past@@ ures has been quite efficient .
however , the sil@@ age was made too late which reduced its dig@@ esti@@ bility .
" Baltic h@@ inter@@ land " ( Minsk Oblast - Molo@@ det@@ ch@@ en@@ o District )
average milk production was 17 l / day / cow in the project against 8 l / day for the other cows .
during the last 12 months , average production was more than 5,000 l / cow against 1,@@ 800 l / cow at the start of the project .
in this climatic region well suited to grass@@ land farming based on PR@@ G + WC , fodder be@@ ets and pe@@ as were s@@ own in spring .@@ 1994 in the framework of the T@@ ac@@ is pilot project .
more than two years later , the recommendations are still being applied and giving full satis@@ fa@@ c ­ tion to the members of the " Private F@@ arm@@ ers Association of Grou@@ z@@ d@@ ovo . "
the electr@@ ically f@@ enced fields are used exclusively by the 100 cows of the former " pilot project . "
the fields demarc@@ ated by these electric fences are small ( 0.5 to 2.5 ha according to the season ) .
the cows spend only one day there .
after 5 to 7 weeks ( according to the growth of the grass ) they return to the field they started out on .
use of the past@@ ure is globally satis@@ fa@@ c ­ T@@ ory .
PR@@ G + WC sil@@ age Made in mid @@@ -@@ @ June 1996 , just before the emergence of the first ears , sil@@ age was of a very good quality and dig@@ esti@@ bility level .

it is grown on 10 ha and is used in the winter to correct the PR@@ G + WC sil@@ age in a ration of about 5 to 10 kg / cow .
weed control is excellent , it is done using B@@ é@@ than@@ al Progress at a low dose ( 1 l / ha ) when the we@@ eds are very young ( two true leaves ) .
following on from this stage the flora is con ­ trol@@ led with two mechanical ho@@ e@@ ings .

Annex 1 : stages of fodder grass farming
stages of grass development ( normal growth )
initially , the gr@@ asses , if the aerial parts are not used during growth , have a completely leaf@@ y development ( the till@@ ering stage ) .
next , the future ear rises in the shaft ( join@@ ting stage ) before emerging from the shaft ( mid @@@ -@@ @ ear emergence stage ) to blos@@ som ( flow@@ ering ) and ri@@ pen ( stage of maturity ) .
from the end of the join@@ ting stage the supporting fi@@ b@@ res are important ( lig@@ nine ) .
the plant becomes less and less dig@@ esti@@ ble .
the reserves contained in the roots are mobil@@ ised to form the grain .
the longer the cutting is delayed the more the re @@@ -@@ @ growth will be put in jeopar@@ dy .
in fact , reduced reserves diminish the plants ' pro ­ duc@@ tivity and strong resistance against drought or the cold C@@ AN@@ NOT be ensured .
by gra@@ zing , use of this first growth * cycle takes place before the plant has reached 20 cm in height ( " ear at 10 cm " of the till@@ ering plateau stage or " the 2 kno@@ ts " stage ) .
use of the first growth cycle for cutting takes place later , but still during the join@@ ting stage .
use of the second , third and forth growth cycles ( exclusively for gra@@ zing )
after using the first growth cycle during the join@@ ting stage ( either for gra@@ zing or cutting ) all the following cycles of ER@@ G are exclusively leaf@@ y .
the plant becomes very dig@@ esti@@ ble and is very conducive to good milk production ( 20 @@@ -@@ @ 25 lit@@ res / day at the beginning of lac@@ tation , without use of concentrates ) .
Annex 1 : stages of fodder grass farming
normal evolution of grass
harvesting by gra@@ zing before heading
use of the first growth cycle : for gra@@ zing and cutting
cutting past@@ ures intended for subsequent use as gra@@ zing in the same year is virtually unknown in the NIS .
however , this is the sole most important means of reducing winter fodder production costs .
indeed , it is no longer necessary to pl@@ ough and sow annually to make the yearly for@@ age sil@@ age .
feed transition phase ( decreasing quantity of sil@@ age , increasing quantity of grass )
harvesting by gra@@ zing ( fields of 250 by 50@@ m2 / cow / day ) depending on the season
building with mil@@ king facilities
the areas given over to sil@@ age production must be rot@@ ated annually .
the turnout must take place as soon as possible , depending on the bearing capacity of the soil .
when the WC has disappeared ( due to poor management the previous year ) , the ER@@ G no longer grows ( due to a lack of nitrogen ) .
it is imperative that management take place using electric fencing on the fields which are used for a maximum of one day .
use of the first cycle of the growth termin@@ ates when the cows no longer have much left to gra@@ ze on ( often it is when the plant has reached the " 2 ­ kno@@ ts stage " ) .
use of the second growth cycle : exclusively gra@@ zing
after use of the of the first growth cycle at the right moment , all the ER@@ G re @@@ -@@ @ grow@@ ths will be leaf@@ y .
it is necessary , after using the first growth cycle to leave the plant to replen@@ ish its reserves ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 6 weeks for the ER@@ G , 58 weeks for the WC ) .
the cows will gra@@ ze on these leaf@@ y re @@@ -@@ @ grow@@ ths in fields enclosed by electric fencing , under the same conditions as du@@ r ­ ing the first growth cycle .
the fields vary daily in size according to the actual amount of grass available .
the fields used for sil@@ age will be used during the second growth cycle in exactly the same way as those used for gra@@ zing .
this rotation between cutting / gra@@ zing is vital to maintain a good balance between the constituents ( 50 % ER@@ G and 50 % WC ) .
the WC is the " engine of the grass@@ lands " without which , there would be no nitrogen for the ER@@ G which pro ­ duc@@ es little of its own .
excessive exploitation causes the WC to disappear and con@@ se ­ qu@@ ently the ER@@ G .
use of the third and fourth growth cycles : exclusively gra@@ zing
after a rest of 58 weeks depending on the growth rate of the grass , the leaf@@ y re @@@ -@@ @ grow@@ ths of the third growth cycle , then the fourth growth cycle are again used under the same conditions as before .
as the ER@@ G and the WC have to be allowed to replen@@ ish their reserves before winter , gra@@ zing should not continue too late into the season .
1995 : situation at the start
the gra@@ zing for the cows was located in poorly productive marsh@@ lands about 5 km from the cow sheds .
close to the cow sheds was about 30 ha@@ . of rough past@@ ure completely degraded and un@@ productive .
annual for@@ age cultivation ( maize ) necessary for the summer ( green for@@ age feeding ) and the winter ( sil@@ age ) were close to the buildings .
in 1996 , cultivation of the spring crops was planned for this area ( barley and o@@ ats ) .
pl@@ ough@@ ing after the maize took place in October 1995 .
1996 : transition stage
the planting of 280 ha@@ . new past@@ ures with gr@@ asses : Er@@ g , associated with a pulse plant : WC ( under@@ se@@ eded with pe@@ as @@@ -@@ @ o@@ ats for sil@@ age )
the simultaneous sowing of shelter plants ( pe@@ as + o@@ ats ) and the future grass@@ land ( ER@@ G + WC ) took place at the end of May 1996 after resumption of cultivation with the winter pl@@ ough@@ ing .
the making of sil@@ age from the cover crop ( pe@@ as + o@@ ats ) was started at the beginning of August 1996 .
1997 and onwards : 280 ha@@ . of new past@@ ures ( ER@@ G associated with WC ) in production
a mobile mil@@ king installation is foreseen for the centre of the new gra@@ zing in order to limit the movement of the cows ( 1 km maximum ) .
the construction of this installation will have to be completed by May 1997 .
these new past@@ ures will be used simultaneously for cutting ( winter reserves ) and for gra@@ zing within electric fence enclo@@ sures ( during the summer ) .

T@@ AD@@ S does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
in Its first five years of operation , 1991 -@@ 1995 , T@@ ac@@ is has committed EC@@ U 2,@@ 26@@ 8 million to launch more than 2,@@ 200 projects .
a part of broader International effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the content of this document is one such action .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results Is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .

T@@ AC@@ IS would be happy to receive suggestions and comments on this document .
communication is the life@@ blood of enterprise .
nevertheless mail volumes continue to grow in developed countries .
this fact demon ­ str@@ ates the enduring popularity of physical mail as a communications medium .
indeed , a reliable mailing system infrastructure is one of the key elements of economic develop ­ ment for individu@@ alised mass communication .
with the expected recovery of the economy in NIS countries , a rise in imports of goods and services together with postal traffic imports is forecast .
such analysis is valuable for assessing traffic prospects and provides Es@@ sen ­ tial market development insights .
the Moscow International Post Office was opened in 1978 .
at that time it was the main office of exchange for the whole of the former Soviet Union .
the political and economic changes which have taken place over the last few years have had a major impact on the volumes of mail and the service requirements .
the entry of cou@@ rier services into the Russian market along with the need to develop new services made change essential .
technological changes have also been very important .
for postal services the impl@@ ica ­ tions of all these changes are immense .

figure 1 : factors for change in the postal services
poor management information systems of markets
inefficient use of resource
the reason for this was that Moscow International Post Office ( M@@ IPO ) was suffering from massive and sustained traffic loss :
figure 2 : yearly evolution of M@@ IPO traffic , before and since the project
traffic shares 1995
the project therefore diagnosed that the desired performance improvement could be achieved without the need for massive investment .
lack of automation systems
the solution was therefore considered ...
, to require : as requiring in priority :
• Mas@@ sive investment of money in equipment
this has enabled the Moscow International Post Office to obtain substantial improve ­ ments in customer service during the course of the project , handling times being reduced by up to 70 % .
this brochure presents this general approach and the main results obtained in the Moscow International Post Office .
introduction
any business needs to have a purpose : an outcome that the enterprise ensures to achieve the satisfaction of its owners and employees .
figure 4 : elements of a V@@ D@@ G quality strategy
achievement means
purpose
how managers will measure performance and success along the way ?
the way managers inspire people and improve methods
training courses New working methods
figure 5 : V@@ D@@ G : vision , Direc@@ tion , Goals
in M@@ IPO , the V@@ D@@ G process included four successive steps :
step 1 : " welcome to the Future " Before the event , each manager received a mo@@ ck copy of " Is@@ vesti@@ a " dated 5 years in the future .
the newspaper carried articles describing what would be happening in Russia in the year 2000 .
several columns carried headings describing aspects of M@@ IPO as if they had been successful , but the details were left blank .
this reversal from the normal method of saying " where next " is vital in any business seeking transformational rather than incremental change .
it helped managers to free their mind to think about what they really wanted to achieve , rather than being un@@ duly concerned about their current state .
in subsequent training sessions , this statement provided a perspective from which all managers could radically re @@@ -@@ @ ap@@ praise their work .
step 3 : how to achieve the vision : the key Direc@@ tions Each of the different aspects of the vision set the agenda for achievement in a number of areas : the key Direc@@ tions .
again the team worked together to prepare detailed statements of satisfactory and su@@ c ­ cess@@ ful outcomes in each of these directions .
these directions would later be vital for establishing the parameters for the managerial restructuring .
step 4 : indicators to define and measure progress : the Goals The final stage was to convert the key directions into a number of measurable goals : indicators of performance showing the degree of progress .
this was a very diff@@ i ­ cult session because few Russian managers have experience of setting their own mea ­ sures : traditionally measures have been set from above .
nevertheless , In the free @@@ -@@ @ thinking environment of the workshop , managers were able to rise above their current problems and identify hard measures of success against which their performance could be judged .
these too would later be crucial for the design of the strategic plan and to help managers define their jobs in terms of purposeful organisation ­ al results .
( business is good investment ? )
( winning new business ? )
development of marketing capacity
the development of the marketing capability of the staff is necessary to anticipate and satisfy customer needs .
before the project started , the marketing team involved two people out of a total organ@@ i ­ s@@ ational strength of 1200 !
new products ideas were based upon what the organisation could do , or on the insti@@ gation of other partners and rarely on careful market research .
on this basis the number of posts in the Marketing Department was expanded from 2 to 10 .
a specialist provided training on market analysis and strategic planning , and built on previous workshops for senior managers on managing the competitive environment .
the result was , for the first time , a rational and scientific market analysis that would enable M@@ IPO to make key decisions on the marketing mix : the Products , the Price , Place ( distribution ) , and Promotion of products .
most importantly , It highlighted the need for constant monitoring of the business environment .
the project started in @@@ -@@ @ house with sampling of customer views through a structured inter ­ view .
a questionnaire was used by M@@ IPO managers to Inter@@ view their customers to build a number of attributes such as : • Per@@ cep@@ tions of service quality • Understanding of key products • Future needs .
an understanding of what customers want and need , and how these requirements will change in the future , is crucial to the sustained success of any business .
• Me@@ et with a customers / marketing staff to find out what it is they really want from the differing services • Test the list of attributes which research suggests are appropriate indicators
design and test sample system
• En@@ sure M@@ IPO have a plan in place which will ensure that results of the customer sampling interview are available within a defined time scale
the customers were very satisfied with many of the products available but made a n@@ um ­ ber of suggestions for improving the service .
( 1 ) See the two T@@ ac@@ is T@@ DP manuals on Market research analysis and Marketing practices .
strategy overview and capital investment
as M@@ IPO emerged into the competitive environment , it was important to establish the strategic basis for their competitiveness .
figure 7 : strategic choices
market penetration : • Incre@@ ase use by existing customers • Win customers from competitors • Conver@@ t non @@@ -@@ @ users to users
market development : • Move into new market segments • Use new distribution channels • Go into new geographical areas
diversification strategy : related diversification : • New products developed from current capability • Ac@@ qu@@ ire other parts of the supply chain
unrelated diversification : • Products which take the business into a new area 0 ~ V Shop , Music ) • Ac@@ qu@@ ire new unrelated work ( sewing shop )
a key feature of M@@ IPO strategy was to manage existing costs and quality to defend market share .
many of the goals of speeding up production could be tack@@ led by low investment through re @@@ -@@ @ designing the way of working .
in this way investment was kept to a minimum .
following this strategy a new bus@@ i ­ ness plan was completed which for the first time involved lower level managers .
this business plan therefore became a realistic and " living " document for management of the enterprise .
its features included : • M@@ ails volume forecasts • Market analysis • Product contribution analysis • Assessment of investment options • Pot@@ ential sources of finance • An operating plan .
in addition , a comprehensive survey of long @@@ -@@ @ term investment options was conduct ­ ed , out@@ lining the relative value of each of these .
more importantly , the sort of pay @@@ -@@ @ back that might be required from each machine to justify the initial investment was demon ­ str@@ ated .
this enabled M@@ IPO to make better decisions about how best to invest their limited funds .
developing the human resource
training session .
training is the way of improving management effectiveness .
the Managing Director gave the programme his full co @@@ -@@ @ operation : his personal example in attending the early workshops gave it great cred@@ ence .
crucially , the directors themselves soon had the insight to recognise that they had to lead and manage the changes the organisation wished to adopt .
the total quality movement has been one of the most enduring features of manage ­ ment thinking over the last decade .
( 1 ) For details on the SW@@ OT analysis see the T@@ DP manual on marketing practices .
developing the human resource
the M@@ IPO directors therefore visited several successful enterprises in UK and produced a list of lessons to be applied in their own organisation .
these were then built into the management training programme .
the final senior manager course was team@@ building .
it had two themes : the way people behaved with each other , and the definition of what M@@ IPO stood for .
the key new feature of this course was the outdoor element .
the managers were taken out of the classroom for a high power sequence of physical and mental challenges each emphasi@@ sing the importance of a different element of team@@ work .
for example , in one exercise one person was blind@@ folded and their partner could communicate only by touch as they sought together to cross a number of obstacles .
after each exercise , the participants analysed what went well and what went badly , and each group was assessed by a trainer .
the full programme is given in the annex ( training course n ° 1 ) , illustr@@ ating how theory and practice lead to action .
by providing leadership by vision and values , the company began to change its whole culture to one of systemic quality .
developing the human resource
4 Business purpose
anyone can talk about what they know : it is a very special person who can help others to learn .
the training session respected the ratio of about 2 hours lec@@ turing to 6 hours practical work .
the training methods used a variety of group exercises , case studies , and in@@ divi@@ d ­ ual work .
in this way the trainer was able to ensure understanding .
to reinforce and fit with the philosophy of measurement , every session was evaluated and spot checks of proof of learning were conducted .
the feedback showed immense satisfaction with the courses and the way they were conducted .
developing the human resource
the perceived training need was immense .
few managers had much experience of the true competitive environment .
still fewer had ideas of techniques that would help them apply their natural entrepreneurial skill .
this left the project with many differing training routes as options .
however , by this time the strategic analysis had several key organis@@ a ­ tional improvement areas .
each area was examined and a course to tackle the need was developed .
more details are found later in this hand@@ book , but the key generic courses for all managers were :
training cour@@ se@@ 1
employee 's skills and brain power to be better harn@@ essed
in order to continue the development of the human resource , M@@ IPO creates a training center delivering also courses to other institutes .
one of the main tactics that ensured success was the creation of a Human Resource Development Department .
indeed they have already sold one training course to another institute .
( 1 ) See Annex for a detailed presentation of the content and organisation of all training courses .
the restructuring of the Post Office business aimed at achieving a greater focus on cus ­ tom@@ er satisfaction , a greater capability for speedy decision @@@ -@@ @ making , and to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative sections .
the structural review was combined with the administration and information system pro ­ Gram@@ me .
the findings and recommendations were developed In conjunction with . Russian partners .
customer satisfaction is the basis of the restructuring programme .
that M@@ IPO were able to do this was testimony to their willingness and determination to change successfully .
the previous structure is described in Figure 8 .
operations
international relations
legal department and documents
buildings and furniture
the strategic logic for the restructuring of the Top Team was to focus upon the key directions of the business defined by M@@ IPO in the " Vi@@ sions , Direc@@ tions , Goals " statement .
six key directions were determined : 1 .
finance 4 .
operations 5 .
business environment 6 .
directions 1 to 3 fall into the classic structures of many global companies , and gave authority to the creation / review of the roles of the following functions : sales , personnel and finance .
direction 5 introduced a requirement for a deeper level of market analysis , and thus added the classic function of " marketing " to that of sales .
direction 6 introduced the idea not only of a new business structure , but also of a set of management actions and behavi@@ ours that would sustain this structure .
the result was the creation of a quality director .
a fourth one ( quality director ) is due to be added soon .
Director of quality ( future ) ( continuing culture change )
note : this structure is right for M@@ IPO , but may not apply to other organisations .
however , the process of producing this structure may be copied in any enterprise .
the administration review element of this programme was added to the original initi@@ a ­ tion document when it became evident that there were significant opportunities for improvement .
the objective was to identify areas for improvement with a view to future changes in the longer term ( 2 years ) .
in addition to identifying opportunities for cost reduction it was also valid to view this exercise in terms of resource real@@ location .
the importance of this work was that by critically ap@@ pra@@ ising the value added by each job , the business was able to diagnose areas of waste and work that was unnecessary .
from this initial sample , the business therefore made a strategic decision to introduce " priority based budgeting " in winter 1996 .
by making decisions on which activities should be paid for in priority order , the enter ­ prise has identified 20 % of administrative posts as unnecessary .
this has primarily been achieved through : • Rem@@ ov@@ ing layers of management structures • Rem@@ ov@@ ing dupl@@ icated work • Im@@ proving communication to prevent wasted time and effort • Im@@ proving decision @@@ -@@ @ making speed .
registered In@@ sured
the analysis confirmed the potential for major improvements in productivity and cus ­ tom@@ er service without the need for substantial capital investment .
this led to develop an agreed strategy , targeting performance improvements in each operational area .
the parc@@ els shop performance improvement
the original layout for import parc@@ els is given in figure 10 .
figure 10 : the parc@@ els shop layout diagram before the project
a steering committee was formed comprising all interested parties .
the project team developed proposals for layouts , working methods and equipment .
these were present ­ ed to the steering committee for formal approval .
the initial track and trace system was subsequently replaced by a combined manage ­ ment information and track and trace system developed by the Information Technology Department of the Moscow International Post Office , with advice from the T@@ ac@@ is consu@@ l ­ tants .
the new layout is detailed below , it is much simpler and a far more manageable process .
figure 11 : the modified parc@@ els shop layout diagram
letters and packets performance improvement
then the focus group agreed on the first prior ­ ities : • Or@@ d@@ inary export letters • Regi@@ stered import small packets .
for example , the USA received far more mail than most places but only had one selection .
this was expanded to five selections .
as a result a whole secondary sorting process was removed for a substantial proportion of traffic .
the new sorting plan was tested and then introduced to the operators using self @@@ -@@ @ teach ­ ing aids .
the selection of letters enabled space to be released on the floor and the process of opening up the floor to an open plan work area like parc@@ els could commence .
the philosophy throughout aimed to achieve major performance improvement without substantial capital investment . this was achieved by : • introduction of a flow line production system using existing equipment .
results for letters : the changes in layout and sorting plans substantially improved productivity and reduced handling time from two days to one day .
in addition paperwork was reduced ( 70 % ) and a very significant reduction in floor space ( 75 % ) was achieved .
results for packets : the registered small packets stream was given priority due to the inherent delays in the processing .
the approach was to move to open working areas , modify layouts and introduce new procedures .
this resulted in a reduction in handling time from three to one day and an initial productivity gain of 10 % .
many mail streams were left untouched .
the results of these include further improvement in mails handling , but they also released a complete floor of the building which might be used for new products or could be let out to other companies .
in introducing track and trace the project bought information technology to the shop floor .
the management of M@@ IPO were concerned that they should not have to rely on an external software supplier in the long term .
they therefore decided to develop their own software to provide an integrated management information system and to provide track and trace capability for all mail streams .
the result is a computer@@ ised total parc@@ els management system .
the system also offers potential new products for the business such as track and trace and mailing list production .

in letters , work on the two main streams resulted in significant reductions in the rate of failure of standard .
indeed the standard has now been raised from 2 days handling time to one :

in all streams the net throughput time has therefore increased remarkably :
figure 14 : improved throughput time
modern@@ ising and developing the international mail handling centre
here , perhaps the best indicator is the speed of managing change .
a truly modern enter ­ prise is equipped to handle change quickly and successfully using its own resources .
as the project developed and as all the cultural changes began to take effect there was a massive and sequential improvement in the speed of implementation of changes and in the willingness of people to take ownership of issues .
figure 15 : speed of change in different workshops
most importantly , this means that Moscow International Post Office now has the cap@@ ab@@ il ­ ity to develop itself for the future .
this self ­ sustainability of the improvements is the real value of the project .
main results
the total investment of capital in this project was only EC@@ U 80,000 .
this was used pr@@ i ­ mar@@ ily for the purchase of new technology for key elements of the process .
this techno@@ l ­ ogy is flexible enough to meet the future needs of the business and thus will ensure a continuing return on investment .
to get value from the investment , M@@ IPO worked hard to use existing staff to amend equipment to suit new working methods .
it is testimony to their skill and determination that they were able to adjust existing machinery to suit new needs .
the first project concept envisaged substantial automation which would have taken the capital requirement to several million EC@@ U .
this was simply unnecessary for the size of improvements desired .
also , the cost justification for such equipment would be unlikely at current wage rates or forecast traffic levels .
in this respect , the strategy of " Vision , Direc@@ tion and Goals " gave strategic choice to the business about how it could achieve its purpose .
the project offers a number of messages for business directors whose organisations face major strategic difficulties :
in M@@ IPO significant capital could have been invested to get the same results .
by generating alternative solutions it has been possible to choose between different options and find a more effective strategy .
investment of money is not always the answer .
in M@@ IPO , the investment needed was of management commitment to change .
once the managers were committed to change they were able to lead the improvements themselves , giving sustainable results .
ownership of both the problems and the solutions must remain in the hands of those responsible for the enterprise .
in M@@ IPO T@@ ac@@ is experts and Russian staff worked together , but it was clearly the M@@ IPO managers who were responsible for action .
the final and most Import@@ ant message is that the directors of the enterprise must lead by their personal example .
they must demonstrate their commitment to change through their personal everyday behavi@@ ours , for it is these that people will copy .
without this example the changes will fail .
in M@@ IPO it was the drive of the senior management team which demonstrated the urgency of the situation .
the success of this technical assistance project has been due to numerous factors many of which have been outside the influence of the project team .
certainly the most imp@@ or ­ tant has been the commitment of the management of the Moscow International Post Office .
without their total commitment progress would have been substantially slower .
four lessons were learnt from the project and may be applicable in other cases of restructuring big public organisation projects .
the holistic approach
the project could not have been a success without the three following th@@ ru@@ sts running together : • Strategic and business development • Training and human resource development • Short term improvement programme .
each thrust reinforced the others and this holistic approach made a major contribution to the delivery of tangible results and the project time scale .
the second lesson is that constant training is indispensable at all levels of any com ­ p@@ any to be restructured .
implementation was slow and many barriers had to be sur@@ mounted .
the overall time scale to implement one major change took in excess of six months .
the third lesson is that short term improvements are required and they are the only way to prove the efficiency of the restructuring process and make the cultural change possible in the company to be restructured .
cultural change
and this is also a lesson to be learnt : restructuring any kind of big organisation in the way of better business absolutely requires cultural change .
the clearest sign of the impact of cultural change was that managers and supervisors felt empowered to plan and implement change within their work area .
the project ended in June 1996 and there was a gap of three months before an ex@@ ten ­ sion was approved .
during this interim period , although progress had proceeded at di@@ f ­ fer@@ ent rates , in total the results achieved were at a higher than expected level , thanks to cultural changes in the staff .
cultural changes are indispensable to make the staff more flexible to meet the real needs .
at the beginning of the project , there was a clear requirement from M@@ IPO that the project should focus on automation options to achieve performance improvement .
this led to a major re @@@ -@@ @ plan at the end of the seventh month which further reduced the focus on the role of automation and capital investment planning .
flexibility to develop a work programme to meet the real business needs and the ability to draw on additional specialists is considered to have made a major impact on the su@@ c ­ c@@ ess of the project .
► Justi@@ fication and characteristics of any training programme
these trainers will be able to sustain the change programme once the assisting organisations withdraw .
the ultimate aim will be for the training available to members of the department to match the skills and techniques required by each type of job .
any mis@@ match between the two will indicate a need for participation in further training .

the course uses a mixture of tutor @@@ -@@ @ led discussion , live examples and group exercises to ensure the transfer of knowledge required to achieve the objective .
although the course is broken down into segments the important point is for the tutor to emphasize the links between all the segments .
this can be reinforced by using group exercises that require the use of skills from all disciplines of business .

T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and priorities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AD@@ S provides kno@@ wh@@ ow from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organisations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the impact of these projects is not limited to the narrow geographical area in which they were implemented .
results will also benefit organisations and individuals in other regions .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
replication of these results Is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the project described here@@ after .
contractor Feder@@ leg@@ no ­ Ar@@ re@@ do ( Italy ) in association with C@@ AST ( Italy )
to show that restructuring does not always require heavy capital investment but rather sound and effective use of existing equipment .
T@@ AC@@ IS would be happy to receive suggestions and comments on this document .
the implementation of these objectives was guaranteed through a practical industrial approach which focused on a secondary transformation which is labour intensive , decentr@@ alised and attractive for foreign investors .
the philosophy was to build a strong and permanent relationship between the Russian wood processing industry and the most relevant European counterparts : industri@@ alists , designers , R & D centres and distributors .
these are " soft " tools which are difficult to purchase on the open market , and are usually only achieved through a strong commitment from the managers .
support from a foreign partner could stimulate this process through providing on a day @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ day basis focused technical assistance .

project philosophy : to build a strong and permanent relationship between the Russian wood processing industry and key European counterparts .
while this project has been conducted with Russian enterprises its results can be applied to any other wood companies in the NIS .
the wood processing industry in Russia
the Russian timber harvesting and wood processing sectors were estimated to include over 3@@ 4,000 enterprises ( usually large in size ) spread over the entire territory of the Russian Federation .
some of these enterprises were owned by the Federation , others were regional , territorial or municipal property .
figure 2 : main characteristics of former USSR companies
quantity was the only control @@@ -@@ @ tool Quality concepts did not exist
• Qu@@ anti@@ ty and social pressures were the main control @@@ -@@ @ tools • The director was more a mayor than an actual manager • Mo@@ tiv@@ ation was low • Produc@@ tivity was low • Competition was low
one of the main problems caused by central planning was the importance given to fulfilling output targets above all other considerations .
planning targets were delivered from the centre and production results were analysed according to these at the end of every year .
the nature centr@@ alised planning resulted in a very low worker motivation , little prospect of job loss and low productivity .
furthermore the industry never had a budget constraints to comply with .

design
from planned economy to free market
over the last five years Russia has been one of the countries most resolute in moving towards a market economy .
the privatisation process has proceeded so rapidly that by 1994 the private sector represented about 50 % of both GDP and employment .
the public sector share of GDP in 1994 was only 30 % , which is a lower percentage than for Italy or France .
they have still to understand the driving force of the mar K@@ et economy and to develop the managerial skills necessary to successfully compete .
figure 4 : the transition to a market economy in Russia
market driving forces are relevant Output quality is important Output volume targets are no longer relevant
• Jobs are not guaranteed for everyone • R@@ aw materials are no longer delivered at fixed prices • Industrial activities are split from social services
• Output quality and increased competitiveness gain importance • Manag@@ erial skills are developed • Marketing tools are created • Mo@@ tiv@@ ation and productivity increase
consequently , the aim of the project was simple : bring a real added value to the Russian wood processing industry at two levels : • restructuring assistance • industrial co @@@ -@@ @ operation .
to guarantee sound implementation of project objectives , the project was composed of three main activities :
• Company selection : selection of the 6 pilot companies to be assisted during the restructuring process .
during this phase : - a large number of companies were analysed using existing documentation - many companies were pres@@ elected and visited In the field - a few companies were finally selected .
this phase lasted 10 months ( from March to December 1994 ) .
• Re@@ structuring assistance : the selected companies were assisted during the restructuring process to support their transition to the new market environment .

to prepare a business plan specifically tailored to the actual situation of each assisted company and to avoid the possibility of failure , the project teams worked strictly in co operation with companies ' management .
to implement business plan 's objectives on a daily basis in the pilot companies , specific actions plans defining for each objective task , responsibilities and monitoring processes were drawn up .
to avoid the occurrence of rejection , rather than propose ready @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ use models the T@@ ac@@ is project experts worked in field with their Russian counterparts resolving daily problems faced by the pilot companies .

re@@ organisation of administration and finances
in the former Soviet Union quantity was the performance indicator used to measure Russian companies little attention was paid to quality .
consequently , one of the main problems during the restructuring process was how to insti@@ l the concept of quality control at every step of the production process and increase the quality of the final products .
some of the outputs of the Russian pilot project were : • increased attention from workers • new maintenance programmes • improved technical capabilities ( ban@@ ding , saw@@ ing , etc . ) .
this was perceived as the reason for the low performance of their companies .
key restructuring factors
to achieve this aim the project drew on its experience to improve lay @@@ -@@ @ out , production flows , organisation of work and maintenance , design and marketing .
furthermore , training visits were organised to selected European manufacturers to give practical examples of the improvements needed and their potential benefits .
the development of new products in the former Soviet Union was usually not dependent on customers / consumers needs : the companies received the impetus to introduce new products from the administrative structure .
consequently , the introduction of new products was a slow process not dependent on customers needs .
the project experts assisted the companies during the start up of new products and the introduction of new development methods .
furthermore , new layouts were developed to maxim@@ ise the use of existing equipment .
new model of bedroom manufactured in Sh@@ at@@ ura .
key restructuring factors
marketing functions were practically non @@@ -@@ @ existent in the assisted companies .
furthermore effective tools have been implement ed to perform : • customers segm@@ entation • marketing analysis and diagnosis • sale network monitoring .
administration and finance
Russian companies often face the problem of having developed accounting systems , which do not provide managers with the information necessary for running the firm .
the restructuring assistance process needs to be supported by a process whereby any foreign company can provide its expertise and its support to the selected Russian com p@@ any .
philosophy and objectives
industrial cooperation aims to create a long @@@ -@@ @ term mutually profitable link between the NIS and European wood processing industries .

partnership
during the negotiation process it is important that the two partners involved ( Russian and European ) take into consideration the different cultural behaviour of each counterpart .

industrial cooperation in three pilot companies
all the companies assisted within the framework of the project have gained advantages from the tailored restructuring assistance .
some of the results have been : • increased market share • development of new products / markets • decrease of stock • new more flexible structures .

Bol@@ ch@@ evi@@ k ( doors and windows )
Sh@@ at@@ ura is a wood processing firm located in the Moscow region , approximately 200 km from Moscow .
when the assistance project started in January 1995 , Sh@@ at@@ ura was a completely integrated company .
industrial cooperation in three pilot companies
the technical characteristics and the level of production did not justify the existence of several dedicated production units .
for this reason , the company was advised to concentrate all the drilling operations In a single production centre located in the central production unit .
the result of the intervention has eliminated all the logistic limiting factors and has led to the improved utilis@@ ation of the plant .
this new layout has resulted in between 20 and 30 % increased productivity .
the company was involved In making modular products of the " pyramid " type .
as a result , a totally new product has been created in cooperation with a European partner , using the new industri@@ alised structure as a basis ( see photo ) .
industrial cooperation in three pilot companies
C ) Marketing Most Russian companies target the poorer segment of the Russian market .
there are several motivations for this : - all Russian furniture companies are at the first commercial experience stage .
almost all of them have to accept the distribution conditions and basically very poor payment terms - design and type of products has mostly remained the same for the last 40 years - product quality is generally low .
for these reasons the new " rich " Russians go and buy in shops that offer imported furniture with a much higher level of quality and design .
this is why the project recommended no longer competing with other Russian companies in this " poor " consumer segment , but rather competing with foreign producers to secure a share of the " richer customers . "
the company then decided to collaborate with European partners in a co@@ production of this new type of furniture .
the resulting products have been distributed to shops catering to the high end of the market that successfully compete with some European imports because of similar quality and design but a lower selling price .
this new type of furniture has been presented at the Moscow Fur@@ niture Fair " Me@@ bel 95 " with excellent results .
the European partner will participate in the Investment needed for the set ­ up of each shop with a cont@@ rib@@ u ­ tion equal to 50 % of the overall investment .
the Sev@@ z@@ ap@@ m@@ bel company ¡ s a wood processing firm located In St. Petersburg ( Leningrad Region ) .
figure 12 : drawing of the new manufactured furniture in Sev@@ z@@ ap@@ me@@ bel
some examples a ) Analysis of the production layout The objectives were to ration@@ alise the use of the technology ( machines and equipment ) in the different production units of the group .
it has recent equipment in good working order , running at 30 % of capacity only .
considering the actual activity volume of the individual units , the project suggested concentrating all the production of the semi @@@ -@@ @ finished products in the " N@@ eva " company .
this would create the opportunity to change the destination of the other less efficient production units .
B ) Products : realisation of a modular system The intervention was similar to that described for Sh@@ at@@ ura .
it resulted in the realisation of complete new products for the living room .
the European company has to supply the design and pre @@@ -@@ @ cut and se@@ wn fabric .
the Russian company real@@ ises the wooden structure , assem@@ bles the uphol@@ stery and the external textiles .
furthermore , the company has aqui@@ red some important construction kno@@ wh@@ ow for the product .
most Russian furniture companies have problems obtaining these accessories since they are generally not present on the Russian market .
the project helped the company to find a European company to help them to source all the accessories they need for their production .
this agreement allows the company to obtain all the latest types and designs of accessories at a competitive price .
industrial co ­ operation in three pilot companies
" Bolshevik " ¡ s a doors and windows manufacturer located In Novosibirsk ( Novosibirsk Region ) .
when the assistance project started in January 1995 the company was integrated from the saw mill to the final product .
the T@@ ac@@ is experts have assisted Bolshevik in : • improving the production quality through focused technical assistance • improving the economic and financial management systems • analysing the doors and windows distribution market in Novosibirsk in order to define new targets .
it is essential to Integr@@ ate the benefits gained from restructuring assistance into an industrial cooperation process .

some information on this brochure
the Kyrgyz Republic came into being by default in 1991 when Russia allowed a number of former satellite countries to go their own way .
due to the changes in the economic situation , many people have suddenly become " new " farmers .
at the end of the Ts@@ arist regime , people were cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from a feudal system into a harsh command system under the Soviets that lasted 75 years .
then came the unexpected pro@@ pulsion in 1991 into democracy and capitalism which were myth@@ ical concepts to many and forbidden topics under the former regime .
such changes over relatively few generations have rarely been , encountered elsewhere except in FS@@ U countries .
what little residual fertility there was in the soil ( mon@@ o @@@ -@@ @ cro@@ pping was common ) , has now been exhausted .
the need for basic ro@@ tations , encouraging fertility build @@@ -@@ @ up linked to small @@@ -@@ @ herd livestock management , is now a real and urgent necessity ( box 2 ) .
yields are low ; there is little cash in the economy ; and farmers are obliged to trade by bar@@ ter for the necessities of life .
whenever people are questioned there are examples of extremes occurring .
University lec@@ turers and musicians have become taxi @@@ -@@ @ drivers , lingu@@ ists take men@@ ial jobs as hotel workers , doctors and engineers become farmers overnight ...
Bo@@ xi : greater consumption of basic foods ­ bread and grain products , potatoes , vegetables and mel@@ on has occurred since 1991 .
consumption of milk , meat , eggs , sugar and vegetable oils have all declined considerably , particularly sugar and oil .
this indicates a greater reliance on lower cost energy foods in times of economic hardship .

graph showing production of main crops between 1990 and 1995 .
farmers saw for themselves the often ini@@ quitous division of assets of the former collective farms in which Directorate staff had been involved .
these factors in particular have contributed to the general lack of business knowledge common among all farmers .
this attitude is changing , fortunately , and will diminish as families have to make decisions on the way ahead .
clearly , any new system had to be free from past sti@@ g@@ mas and concepts farmers had about the old system .
starting from scratch - which extension system ?
it was necessary to design an extension system which would meet the needs and conditions existing in the Kyrgyz Republic .
agricultural Development and Advisory Service ( AD@@ AS )
the AD@@ AS was entirely financed by the MA@@ F@@ F until April 1987 . farmers now have to sign a contract with AD@@ AS for advisory service input co@@ sted on a per hour basis .
which solution for Kyrgyzstan ?
the choice of advisory service model
while the national centre ( AT@@ AC ) is situated in the M@@ AF H@@ Q , its activities as an advisory service to small farmers are not well understood by all .
the choice of advisory service model
an administrative map of the Kyrgyz Republic shows the regional and ra@@ yon boundaries in Figure 1 .

the choice of advisory service model
AT@@ As will promote improved productivity within the agricultural industry by influencing farmer / manager decision making .
it will provide farm business manage ­ ment planning services , and a range of crop and livestock technical services .
the objective will be to optim@@ ise profitability for the individual farm within a sustainable agricultural system which is ' environmentally friendly ' .
those holdings judged to be at subsistence level will still be eligible for assistance where AT@@ As judges that it can be of assistance
thus the provision of market information is important
it will forge closer links between the industry and the National / International Research and Development Institutions
AT@@ As will ensure that its technical advice is based on good laboratory practice , where this is appropriate 11 .
AT@@ As will pay due regard to the need to create a sustainable agricultural industry and to protect , and where necessary improve , the environment .
this will have implications for the use of farm inputs and their impact on crops , stock , people and land .
the Service will also pay due regard to landscape , soil , and water quality , and the disposal of animal and chemical waste .
thus AT@@ As will work with other agencies concerned with the countryside and its protection
AT@@ As will be the leading partner in the formation of a unified Agricultural Information System 15 .
national level The central unit of the service is called the Agricultural Training and Advisory Centre ( AT@@ AC ) and is situated within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food headquarters in the capital .
it has been guided since its inception by expatri@@ ate advisors provided by the T@@ ac@@ is project during 1995 and 1996 .
in the two regions a total of 30 staff are based at the regional and ra@@ yon centres , making a total staff complement of 34 .
it is estimated that advisory staff are currently in contact with about 2,000 farmers in the two regions .
each centre has two vehicles .
ra@@ yon ( local ) level In the four Tal@@ as ra@@ y@@ ons covered by AT@@ As there are 8 advisors ( 3 agr@@ onom@@ ists , 3 live ­ stock technicians , 1 veter@@ in@@ arian and 1 irrigation techn@@ ician ) .
it has 5 ra@@ y@@ ons covering a large area .
a rigorous system of staff selection was undertaken to ensure that , as far as possible , the right people were chosen for the vac@@ ancies .
advertisements for the vac@@ ancies were placed in local newspapers , on local television and radio .
57 candidates were invited to sit a series of 2 entry examinations of 3 hours ' duration .
all candidates were interviewed twice by 2 different staff , and final selections were made by a panel of project consultants .
only 15 applicants were successful and a second round of recruiting was necessary to fill the vac@@ ancies .
successful candidates were given an initial three @@@ -@@ @ month contract on prob@@ ation , contingent upon su@@ itability and capability , and dependent upon continued funding under T@@ ac@@ is .
AT@@ As advisers with farmers in Ray@@ on office .
recruits were also instructed in the use of questionnaires in a baseline survey using private farmers , involved with the pre @@@ -@@ @ testing of the survey on farmers on the outskirts of Bishkek .
after modification of the initial questionnaires , recruits were posted to their work areas ( ra@@ y@@ ons ) and given three weeks to conduct the survey .
this gave them the opportunity to introduce themselves to the farmers , explain what the service was attempting to do , and to gain first @@@ -@@ @ hand knowledge from farmers of their problems .
the list is given in Annex 1 .
monthly training of staff and programme schedules Two days are set aside each month for staff training at the regional centre .
this could include specialists or consultants visiting the country , or specialists from other organisations working in the Kyrgyz Republic .
the choice of advisory service model
the remaining 1.5 day , advisory staff would be available for farmers in the ra@@ yon office .
overseas training An 8 @@@ -@@ @ week overseas training course was organised by the University of Reading through the Department of Agricultural Ex@@ tension and R@@ ural Development .
the AT@@ As staff consisted of 3 regional advisors and 7 ra@@ yon advisors from the Tal@@ as and Is@@ sy@@ k @@@ -@@ @ Ku@@ l regions , led by the Director of AT@@ As .
meetings with potential business investors , and the retail and wholesale trade representatives were organised .
a study tour was arranged for 16 participants visiting the Th@@ ames Valley in England , Central Wales , and the Ae@@ gean region of Turkey .
costs of establishing the AT@@ As
recent monthly running costs show little change from the 1995 figures .

the AT@@ As has made considerable progress in the almost two years since it started .
the situation after two years of operation
a farm management hand@@ book is in production for which a charge will be made when it is ready for release to farmers .
whilst temporary holding arrangements are in place for funding in ig@@ 97 , the position after that time will have to be resolved rapidly .
there is a need to integrate more fully the research and advisory functions to ensure that farmers ' real needs and problems are met , with on@@ farm
at present the complete financing of the advisory services is met by grant funding by the various donors .
some of this Is short @@@ -@@ @ term funding as In the case of T@@ ac@@ is .
governmental option
however , It is to be hoped that the advisory service will assist in pushing agricultural productivity and profitability to a level at which farmers might be prepared to support it financially .
the Im@@ mediate question to be answered concerns funding . any donor funding is dependent on long @@@ -@@ @ term loans with soft interest terms .
towards a sustainable and relevant service
concerning farmer training , this is an entirely new concept as the small farmer never previously existed .
the initial development work carried out by T@@ ac@@ is in setting up the AT@@ As has been shown to be successful , and is addressing farmers ' needs .

Annex 2 : main characteristics of the other advisory approaches in Kyrgyzstan
intervention by GT@@ Z ( German bilateral aid ) has only recently started In the country and is not sufficiently established to allow comparisons to be made .
a map giving the locations of the various projects is provided in Figure 3 .
each ra@@ yon has a population of around 50,000 people with between 15 and 20 villages each .
in terms of visiting programmes for advisory staff , there is much similarity with the AT@@ As system .
the Swiss approach has been very much oriented to farmer participation and aimed at creating self @@@ -@@ @ help groups in order to improve the ser v@@ ices to the agricultural sector .
in order to obtain a loan , a farmer must first be a member of a village group , and pay a membership fee .
representatives from village boards come together on a Ray@@ on board which undertakes the decision @@@ -@@ @ making on loan applications and articul@@ ates the views of farmers to the advisors and management of the project .
a monthly information bulletin on market prices is distributed to around 100 shops and Ak@@ im@@ i@@ ats on a regular basis .
the project management aims to involve as much as possible the Ak@@ s@@ ak@@ al ( white be@@ ards ) of the communities in all its interventions for these Ak@@ s@@ ak@@ al have considerable local influence .
clearly , the complement@@ arity of loan funding alongside advisory input is a great stimulus to further development on the part of farmers .

a fund of 300,000 Swiss Franc@@ s ( EC@@ U 19@@ 2,000 ) was provided for loans to farm ­ ers .
advisors assist potential borrowers by drawing up business plans for them and the process for obtaining loans is similar to that implemented by Hel@@ vet@@ as .

GT@@ Z started operations in Osh region in July 1996 for a period of 5 years with the overall aim of organising private operating and service structures in agriculture within the market economy .
the work will be carried out in 4 ra@@ y@@ ons with 1 advisor in each Ray@@ on .
credit is available through a number of organisations , AC@@ DI , Mer@@ cy Corps , and ADB .

it is expected that the GT@@ Z team will work closely with the Union to assist members .
both farmers and advisers press this point very clearly when questioned .
approximately 70 advisors are at work in the 6 regions and covering 16 ra@@ y@@ ons at present .
when GT@@ Z is fully on @@@ -@@ @ stream there will be coverage in 20 ra@@ y@@ ons , representing 43 % of the total area .

definition of management ( or cost ) accounting
the figures normally produced by financial accounting for outsiders ( shareholders , tax authorities and so on ) may be adequate to take the management dec@@ i ­ sions .
providing this decision @@@ -@@ @ orient@@ ated information is the task of management accounting , also named cost accounting .
the basis of management accounting Is the accurate and relevant costing of the products and / or the activities of the company .
several methods are used to make this costing , depending on the various objectives of management decisions .
they are financial accounting and management ( or cost ) accounting .
it also deals with the potential effects of decisions not yet taken , such as investment alternatives , introduction of new products or sales increases .
this leads to an additional categor@@ isation of costs according to their re@@ ac ­ tion to volume changes : fixed versus proportional cost
• the structures and definitions used in management accounting depend on special requirements for decision and communication in a particular company rather than financial accounting regulations .
thus its definitions of cost and value , and there ­ fore of profit , depend on the question being investigated and may differ radically from those of financial accounting .
in management accounting , for example , asset values usually reflect ( less easily audited ) replacement cost rather than the historic costs of financial accounting .
the crucial test of the quality of management accounting information is relevance to the specific decision under investigation in the particular company .

a costing method prescri@@ bes how costs are to be defined , collected and presented .
a cost object is anything whose costs we want to know .
so while describing both traditional and modern methods of cost calculation , this brochure pays particular attention to the purposes for which we need the cost inform@@ a ­ tion : the cost objective .
cost types define what money is spent on .
a cost object is anything of which we want to know the cost .
the most obvious cost object is the product , whether It be a mou@@ se@@ trap , motor car or power station .
we can easily extend this concept to groups of products and to In@@ tangible products or services from hair@@ cuts to bank loans .
cost centres collect cost by responsibility area .
but , cost objects can be very abstract , but nevertheless crucial to improve our compet@@ i ­ tiveness on the marketplace .
what , for example , Is the total cost of bringing a new pro@@ d ­ UC@@ T to the market or the annual cost of correcting manufacturing errors ?
the categories we use to analyse product or other cost object costs differ from case to case .
product ( manufacturing ) cost is identified with purchased or produced goods .
indirect costs are not necessarily fixed , nor direct costs necessarily variable .
energy for anc@@ illary departments Vehic@@ le fuel costs of sales departments
salaries of supervisors and management Sal@@ aries of sales representatives Heating energy Machine depreciation in anc@@ illary departments
generally speaking , Western manufacturing wages are increasingly fixed .
the thermo@@ stat and switching mechanism were both technically , and in marketing terms , the heart of the product and were protected by a large number of patents .

case study n ° 1 : suggested solutions
remarks
costing for profit measurement
product costing for profit measurement often determines the choice of costing system for all other cost objectives in the company .
it is therefore important to understand not only why profit measurement is necessary but also how limited this cost objective actual ­ ly is .
it is also in many companies a very limiting cost objective from the point of view of achieving relevant cost figures for other purposes .
while complying with legal and accounting requirements it often fails to supply relevant data .
the matching concept states that costs must match revenues when determining profit for a certain period
this chapter first explains why stock valuation is needed for profit calculation ( matching concept ) and shows how financial accounting constraints can produce misleading values for stocks and other assets .
it then looks at ways of simpli@@ fying the method in companies with modern manufacturing techniques that tend to reduce stocks .
importance of stocks in profit calculation
we need product cost to establish stock values at the beginning and end of the account ­ ing period to be able to match costs and revenues during the period .
this matching or accru@@ al concept is crucial to profit calculation because differences in stock values can lead to very different profit figures based on the same cash transactions :
example of two different profit figures from the same cash
cash inflow ( from sales )
cash outflow For stocks purchased For other expenses
alternative 1 100
( 1 ) The example assumes corresponding adjustments to accounts recei@@ vable not shown here .
costing for profit measurement
in a manufacturing company finished goods are valued at the lower end of Manufac@@ tu@@ r ­ ing costs or market value .
stock values do not include the costs of other depart ­ ments such as sales , service , research and development or finance and administration .
this is because stock values should only reflect the costs to the company of replacing the stocks as they are used or sold .
but you , Mr Grad@@ gr@@ ind , say that I have overlooked an Import@@ ant principle !
what , on the basis of the above information , would Mr Grad@@ gr@@ ind ( assuming he is a well @@@ -@@ @ trained accountant ) say the correct gross profit figure is ?

in practice there would also normally be changes in the stocks of parts and components and of work @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ progress during the year .

stock valuation methods
financial accounting uses full or absorption costing to value stocks .
in other words all manufacturing or production cost is charged to work in progress , then to finished goods before entering the profit and loss account as cost of goods sold .
this definition of stock values complies with most financial accounting guidelines and tax regulations .
work in progress and finished goods
profit and loss account
costing for profit measurement charged as a period expense directly to the profit and loss account .
this means that the value attributed to stocks is lower .
figure 2 : variable costing method for stock valuation
fixed overhead

the following example shows that the difference between the two techniques affects reported profits whenever there is a change in stock levels .
base data for a manufacturing company with one product
absorption ( full ) costing
January February March
units sold Un@@ its produced Change in stock level
units sold Un@@ its produced Change in stock level
cost of sales Fixed manufacturing overhead Total product cost
this remains true although adjustments are made to the cost of sale figures when fixed over@@ heads are over@@ absorbed by unexpectedly high production volumes .
when stocks fall , variable costing systems show higher profits .
this is not necessarily so in absorption costing .
• economic asset life may be longer or shorter than expected .
the seriousness of these problems is often forgotten because modern investment appraisal techniques avoid the difficulty entirely by adopting a purely cash flow analysis .
this can lead to serious distortions .
the following example therefore reviews typical financial depreciation met@@ h ­ ods and contrasts them with a management accounting approach , which avoids the dis ­ tor@@ tions and corresponds more closely in its results to modern investment appraisal techniques .
financial depreciation for tax and published accounts
machine purchased on 1.@@ 1.@@ 1997 for 1,200 million rub@@ bles .
accumulated depreciation at end of year Net book value at end of year
net book value is the historic cost of the asset minus accumulated depreciation .
( 1 ) The depreciation period Is generally fixed by local financing legislation .
machine purchased on 1.@@ 1.@@ 1997 for 1,200 million rub@@ bles .
expected life 6 years , net scrap value after 6 years : 0 .
annual inflation rate for this type of machine ( % )
calculation of management accounting no@@ tional depreciation for a machine exceeding its expected useful life ( million rub@@ bles )
machine purchased on 1.@@ 1.@@ 1997 for 1,200 million rub@@ bles .
expected life 6 years , expected net scrap value after 7 years : 0 .
annual inflation rate for this type of machine ( actual % )
straight @@@ -@@ @ line depreciation ( ori ; finally over 6 years , 2003 : 7 years )
in extreme cases it can lead to negative asset values , though these are seldom made explicit .
however this is usually toler@@ able because management accounting tends to focus on current and future periods .
the advantage of no@@ tional value is that it continually correc@@ ts depreciation to reflect the current cost of using the assets .
this becomes clear If we consider the effects of such figures on management 's readiness to invest in a new machine in , say , 2003 .
the value of an asset equals the present value of all its future earnings for the comp@@ a ­ ny . 2 .
because this is usually difficult to calculate it is approxim@@ ated by net replacement value ( i.e. replacement value of new machine minus accumulated depreciation ) .
this figure can become negative if the machine long out@@ lasts its original life expectancy .
it is however a seldom used figure . 3 .
gross replacement value increases year by year because of inflation .
depreciation in any one year is thus the average gross asset value ( replacement value ) during the year divided by the expected total years of life of the asset .
these depreciation values are difficult to audit , but if carefully calculated are roughly right .
so far we have only been looking at the manufacturing cost of products , mainly to value stocks as part of profit calculation .
much of this cost is direct and so allocating costs to different products has not caused great problems .
quite large mistakes in allocating the remaining indirect costs to individual products may only have quite small effects on reported profits of the whole company .
however as most companies sell more than one product , management accounting must often show the effects of decisions on one product on the profit of the whole company .
this might be a decision to drop a product , to manufacture it in a different way or even to buy it ready made for res@@ ale .
we therefore often need to allocate manufacturing and other indirect or overhead cost to products or processes .
financial accounting methods of product costing , aimed mainly at profit calculation for the whole company , do not usually provide complete and relevant Information of this sort .
indeed they can mis@@ lead management into making a series of wrong decisions at product level , with disastrous consequences for the company as a whole .
while some management decisions obviously require the preparation of unique inform@@ a ­ tion , the costing systems described below attempt to provide useful information for a broad range of frequent decisions .
the information they provide must be judged on its relevance .
the following examples show different approaches in management accounting to AL@@ L@@ O ­ c@@ ating overhead costs to products .
overhead allocation : the problem
this is a simplified example of a company making products manually .
to concentrate fully on the allocation problem it assumes initially that stocks remained constant during the accounting period and that manufacturing over@@ heads are fixed .
the allocation problem concerns both the manufacturing over@@ heads and the other over ­ head expenses such as R & D and administrative costs .
or does it perhaps make so large a loss that total company profits would increase if its production were stopped ?
simplified example of an overhead allocation problem
traditional absorption ( full ) costing for overhead allocation
absorption ( full ) costing al@@ locates full costs to cost objects , usually on the basis of direct costs or physical output measures .
the techniques used vary in degree of detail and the choice of AL@@ L@@ O ­ c@@ ation base .
this method is usually extended to distribute other expenses among products and thus arrive at a full cost per product or product line .
traditional , direct cost based , absorption ( full ) costing approach to allocating overhead cost
total expenses ( 9 + 10 + 11 ) 13 .
net profit / loss on full cost basis ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 13 )
on the face of it , the figures seem to show that Product Β is losing money .
direct product cost + manufacturing over@@ heads correspond to usual stock value definitions . • For product range decisions ?
the net profit figure for both products is an un@@ satisfactory basis for product range decisions : - The actual division of say , R & D expenses between A and Β is unlikely to be reflected in their share of direct labour cost .
Β may , for instance , be a well established product needing little development input , while A still requires further development .
even if all manufacturing overhead costs were due to product Β ( which is highly unlikely ) , it would still show a positive gross profit figure .
in most companies this is an over@@ sim ­ pli@@ fication .
this can lead to dangerous distortions .
these figures show that Product A has a higher percentage G@@ ross Mar@@ gin .
this may help to decide whether or not to accept a very low offer price for an order which would utilis@@ e otherwise idle capacity .
it has one cost driver : volume and one cost object : products .
however as company costs have become increasingly fixed and indirect , so the prop@@ or ­ tion of total cost covered by marginal / direct costing has declined .
the medium term risks of undermining the whole price structure by basing even exceptional pricing decisions on such data have risen accordingly .
multi @@@ -@@ @ level contribution costing attempts to push product , product group or business area information as close as possible to individual products without arbitrary allocation .
multi @@@ -@@ @ level contribution costing al@@ locates overhead succ@@ essively to the narrow@@ est possible product categories at each cost level .
this method combines a double approach : 1 .
if cost C@@ AN@@ NOT be allocated to individual products , it al@@ locates them to the smallest rel ­ ev@@ ant groups of products . 2 .
it divides over@@ heads into two categories : • directly al@@ loc@@ able ( usually through negotiation with the overhead department man ­ agers ( Human Resources , Administration , ... ) • non directly applicable .
it then al@@ locates them with a traditional direct cost based method ( using labour cost percentage for example ) .
in this example , all manufacturing over@@ heads could be identified with individual products .
with the information available it was not possible to allocate any administrative overhead to product groups .
this was prob@@ a ­ bly because administrative activities are too remote from individual products for the administrative manager to perceive the connection .
= Cost of goods sold
contribution Level II ( " product manager " level )
it thus fails to analyse characteristics of cost objects , other than volume , which may be changed by management decisions .
cost attribu@@ tion by Activity Based Co@@ sting ( ABC )
in the 1980 's these in@@ adequ@@ acies of full and marginal / direct costing led to the develop ­ ment of Activity Based Co@@ sting ( ABC ) .
this has allowed a much higher proportion of total company cost to be allocated to products more strictly according to caus@@ ation .
collect costs of similar , or connected , activities in different overhead cost c@@ en ­ T@@ res ( manufacturing or other ) in activity cost pools .
cost pools collect the costs of similar , or connected , activities across many cost centres and cost types .
this cost collection is usually based on a questionnaire , completed by overhead cost centre managers for a recent reference period .
example of questionnaire for establishing capacity use by activity
capacity used in reference period
% of total capacity
preparing route sheets for new products and components
Department total
one questionnaire must be established for each department .
identify cost drivers of each cost pool , quanti@@ fy cost drivers per product and derive allocations to product cost .
there Is an almost infinite variety of cost drivers from which to choose when explaining the costs of an activity .
they must however be quanti@@ fiable both in relation to the cost pool and to the cost objects , in this case the products .
► Case study n ° 3 : activity based costing
it contains both steps of ABC .

to what extent would management have to contribute to the answers you gave under 1 . 3 .
case study n ° 3 : suggested solutions
" correcting manufacturing errors " costs a total of 3@@ 92 in five departments of which 2@@ 94 is " attributable " to production of the kettle .
what would happen to these costs if kettle production fell 10 % or stopped altogether ?
most of this overhead cost is salary and social security cost .
it does not therefore vary automatically with production vo@@ l ­ ume .
the adjustment to c@@ essa ­ tion of kettle production would take longer unless bankruptcy threatened .
to what extent would management have to contribute to the answers you gave under 1 .
very greatly , at every stage .
none of these reductions would be automatic .
on the information above , roughly 1,@@ 240 = 2,@@ 3@@ 17 / ( 1,@@ 8@@ 88 + 1,@@ 6@@ 39 ) χ 1,@@ 8@@ 88 if all over ­ head were allocated In a full cost system .
do these ABC figures tell us anything other than how to allocate various costs to the two products ?
the most interesting information is in Step 1 .
this information quanti@@ fies the damage done by errors and activities that could , in principle , be avoided by better management , for example : manufacturing errors .
this cost information does not appear in the usual management accounts .
thus the cost of manufacturing errors is usually shown as being only the direct labour cost of re@@ work .
as we see here It is much more .
some commentators therefore suggest that ABC need go no further than Step 1 to achieve 80 % of its benefits .
use of costing methods for product portfolio decisions
accurately analysing each product cost provides an important management tool to assess the individual profitability of the products .
nevertheless , some false signals from the management accounting systems can lead to an inappropriate retreat from profitable market segments .
these false signals from their management accounting systems have seduc@@ ed western companies into a retreat from value added .
this explains that many Western management accounting systems have ( un@@ intentional ) bi@@ ases :
• too much cost allocated to large volume , simple products ; too little to specialist niche products
less than 1 / 5 of total cost is direct labour .
but over 1 / 3 is overhead ( even without de@@ pre ­ ci@@ ation ) , over 1 / 2 including depreciation .
ABC tries to allocate the al@@ loc@@ able , all the al@@ loc@@ able and nothing but the al@@ loc@@ able@@ . B@@ LE .
over the years the basic kettle remained surprisingly unchanged .
however , variants on the original " A " model were gradually introduced and by 1986 this basic kettle was only contributing one third of total kettle sales .
nonetheless it was still clearly the biggest sell ­ ing single model .
the top of the line model , for example , was " cor@@ dless " in the sense that it could be picked up from a fully det@@ achable base .
the " cor@@ dless " kettle commanded a very much higher price ( more than twice the basic kettle ) In the market .
the penalty was an inevitable duplication of components in the kettle and its base .
they also com ­ man@@ ded a higher market price , though not as high as the " cor@@ dless " kettle .
J@@ ock Stewart , the Production Director regarded the more complex models as his baby as they had all experienced considerable technical difficulties when introduced .
indeed it had only been in the last 12 months that quality problems and w@@ ast@@ age had been largely overcome .
this was luck , or good management , as by 1986 he was having to turn his attention to even greater problems of this sort with the new coffee pot .
" A@@ ye " he said " that cor@@ dless kettle still stops the line quite a lot , but at least we catch the problems before they get to the customer .
but , of course , it all works out in the end .
the last figures I saw did@@ n '@@ t look at all good for the old standard kettle .
it 's that competition from Third World ket@@ tles that 's doing it .
I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be surprised if we close down our lines and start buying the model " A " from the same source . "
questions : 1 .
what would happen to the main overhead categories , and net profit , if R@@ H stopped
case study n ° 4 : suggested solutions
do the figures support his negative view of the standard " A " model kettle ? a ) Traditional cost figures Yes .
if overhead ( manufacturing and other ) is allocated according to the distribution of direct labour hours , the basic kettle makes a loss .
all other models are profitable .
even on a full cost basis all models are profitable except Model " D. "
in this case , it is fairly clear that the traditional method of overhead al@@ loc@@ a ­ tion underestimated the particular problems , and hence overhead cost , caused by the complexities of Model " D. "
model " A " makes a contribution of 6@@ 39 and should there ­ fore be retained .
what would happen to the main overhead categories if R@@ H stopped making the " A " model ?
we can assume that direct wages and materials would be saved almost autom@@ atical ­ ly .
this amounts to 1,@@ 3@@ 61 .
to put it another way , the total " contribution 2 " would fall by 6@@ 39 from 1,@@ 5@@ 62 to 9@@ 23 , reducing total net profit from 650 to 11 .
thus the ABC analysis shows us fairly clearly , that abandoning model " A " would be very un@@ wise .
but did@@ n '@@ t we know this already ?
as even J@@ ock Stewart admitted " I just can '@@ t ¡ mag@@ ine R@@ H without the good old model " A. " "
there has been considerable discussion at R@@ H Ltd. about the very high costs of pro@@ du@@ c ­ ing the heating element for the coffee pot and its surrounding parts .
there are several reasons why the element is very expensive to make .
the most important is simply that it is designed to last forever , or at least as long as the rest of the coffee pot .
for technical reasons to do with the bon@@ ding of the element assembly to the ceramic body , it is more or less impossible to replace a defective element .
this however raises the question of how much it costs R@@ H nowadays to build the element .
in particular , he has asked you the following questions ( see annex 1 for detailed data and parameters ) :
what is the winding department 's hourly rate for its own direct costs : - including no@@ tional capital charges ? - including financial capital charges ? 2 .
what , if anything , is wrong with using these overhead rates ? 4 .

what , if anything , is wrong with using these overhead rates ?
in fact , these conditions are not met here , and are very seldom met in reality .
this did not matter very much when overhead was only a small part of total cost , but overhead is more than half of R@@ H LT@@ D 's total cost .
in companies with less manual assembly activity , overhead 's share Is typically even higher .

applying costing methods to make decision about use
many important decisions about asset utilis@@ ation are taken at quite low levels in company hierarch@@ ies .
it is thus important that decision rules are clear and correct .

planning and control provides a continuous check on whether the corporation is fulfilling its financial objectives at every level .
it is also a precondition of decentr@@ al@@ ising decision making without abandoning those objectives .
nearly all such systems nowadays are standard cost , rather than actual cost , sys ­ t@@ ems .
almost all Western companies use some sort of standard cost system .
it is even accept ­ ed for external reporting to tax authorities and shareholders .
standard costing is both a simplification and an analytical tool .
a cost vari@@ ance is the difference between the actual cost and the standard cost ( of actual output ) of a cost centre .
it would , for example , mean tracing the supplier invoice for each batch of materials issued by stores to the manufacturing department in order to find the actual cost of each unit produced .
this would be very expensive .
in practice , usually only the average cost per quantity unit of materials is charged to the cost centre using it .
vari@@ ances from standard show each responsible manager 's specific action requirements in order to meet previously agreed targets in the future .
standard costing systems define standard cost as ( actual units ) χ ( standard cost per unit ) in each responsibility centre .
this chapter therefore looks first at establishing standards for standard costing systems in preparation for vari@@ ance analysis .
it then explains the use of these standards in v@@ ari ­ ance analysis to explain deviations from planned profit and prepare corrective measures .
it then compares marginal and full cost budgeting systems .
operation of a standard costing system
at the end of the period the system would compare planned costs with actual costs and note discrepancies .
but , of course , actual output and sales are very seldom exactly as expected .
thus such a simple system would constantly be reporting discrepancies that were purely caused by volume changes , and so of little interest to management .
most standard costing systems include five main steps :
standard costing system : basic steps
determine standard costs per unit for each responsibility centre
record actual costs of each responsibility centre
calculate standard cost of actual output for each responsibility centre
compare standard and actual cost and analyse vari@@ ances take corrective action to avoid future vari@@ ances
monitor and correct standards to reflect changes in actual usage and prices
each of these steps is described in more detail below .
determine standard costs per unit for each responsibility centre
standards are determined historically or analy@@ tically .
costing for planning and control remuneration , The method can also be used for repetitive activities in the office , as opposed to shop floor , environment .
for many activities however the analytical approach is too complicated or requires data that are not available .
many companies therefore use historical standard costs , modified to reflect company cost saving goals and technical or organisational improvements .
raw material cost standards , for example , thus often reflect average historical costs per unit .
these might be reduced to take account of expected savings through success in ne@@ go@@ ti ­ ation with suppliers or reduction of w@@ ast@@ age in production by improving technology .
piece work is a remuneration system in which the employee is paid according to units produced .
its usefulness declines as the employee 's influence on time per unit is reduced by increasing automation .
all standard costs must be regularly adjusted to reflect inflation .
no standard cost system can be better than its cost standards and the setting of Amb@@ i ­ tious but achievable standards is important .
factory overhead
a
calculate standard cost of actual output for each responsibility centre
flexible budgets establish cost targets for cost centres with reference to actual output levels .
each responsibility or cost centre is allowed costs In relation to the output it actually pro ­ duc@@ es .
this standard cost ( of actual output ) is calculated by multipl@@ ying the actual n@@ um ­ ber of units by the standard cost per unit .
as long as standards have been established for all types of product , this system can handle any product range .
record actual costs of each responsibility centre
the actual costs of each responsibility or cost centre are calculated in the normal way .
in practice , some of the actual costs of a particular cost centre will be calculated with the help of average ( sometimes also conf@@ us@@ ingly called standard ) costs .
compare standard and actual cost and analyse vari@@ ances , take corrective action
with the above information it is possible to compare the total actual costs of the cost centres with their standard costs for the actual level of output achieved .
in the example , a variable costing system is in use in which only variable costs are assigned to products .
this means that only the variable standard costs of the cost centre vary with output .
standard fixed costs are simply the original bud@@ geted costs and can be compared directly with actual fixed costs , without reference to actual output levels .
budgets that include cost elements that are adjusted to reflect volume changes in this way are also referred to as flexible budgets .
in this example a manufacturing company produces a single product , which is known as sig@@ ma .
the product requires a single operation , and the standard cost for this operation is presented on the standard cost card as follows :
standard selling price
annual bud@@ geted fixed over@@ heads are US $ 1,@@ 4@@ 40,000 and are assumed to be incurred evenly throughout the year .
the company uses a variable costing system for internal profit measurement and other management accounting purposes .
manufacturing over ­ heads are charged to production on the basis of direct labour hours .
however April turned out to be a disappointment .
actual production and sales for April were 10 % down from budget at 9,000 sig@@ mas .
for these and other reasons , the actual results for April were quite different from the budget .
the first step is to calculate the cost and sales vari@@ ances which quanti@@ fy the components of the total profit vari@@ ance .
since the object is to come to a complete explanation of the total profit vari@@ ance , it is useful to establish a relevant profit tree for the whole company ( see following figure ) .
most of the branches of this tree end in a pair of vari@@ ances .
one vari@@ ance is related to the amount of a scarce resource used by the cost centre ( usage , efficiency , volume ) and the other to its price or cost .
this is often useful because the manager responsible for how frequently it is used is often not responsible for the price that the company pays for the resource .
for example , in large companies negotiations with trade unions on wage rates are often handled by the personnel department rather than the manufacturing depart ­ ment .
vari@@ ance analysis : profit Tree
labour efficiency vari@@ ance
the sales department Is responsible both for prices achieved and sales volume but not manufacturing cost .
sales margin ( contribution ) price vari@@ ance = ( actual margin - standard margin ) χ actual sales volume .
it shows the vari@@ ance caused by the actual sales margin being different from the stan ­ d@@ ard margin , because of deviations from standard selling price .
sales margin ( contribution ) volume vari@@ ance = ( actual sales volume - sales volume ) χ standard contribution margin .
it shows the difference in contribution caused by sales volume devi@@ ating from plan .
it Val ­ UES the volume difference at the standard contribution margin .
this Is an adverse vari@@ ance as sales volume was below budget .
thus the total sales margin ( contribution ) vari@@ ance was $ 18@@ ,000 ­ $ 20,000 = ­ $ 2,000 .
clearly further investigation of the vari@@ ance and the formulation of corrective measures must start with the sales department .
there may be a link between the higher prices achieved and the lower sales volume .
however , it may be that other departments are involved .
for example , the manufacturing department may not have been able to deliver on time .
vari@@ ance analysis C@@ AN@@ NOT replace Intel@@ lig@@ ent management , but it does supply a useful basis for decisions .
fixed overhead vari@@ ance = budget - actual costs .
fixed over@@ heads ( manufacturing or other ) , unlike materials cost , are not calculated per unit of output or input .
as this ¡ s a variable cost system , fixed costs are controlled by a straightforward comparison of actual costs with bud@@ geted costs .
in this case : 1@@ 20,000 ­ 116@@ ,000 = US $ 4,000
this is a favourable vari@@ ance as actual costs were below budget costs .
there are many possible reasons for this .
variable overhead vari@@ ances = ( actual direct labour hours χ bud@@ geted overhead per direct labour hour ) - actual variable overhead .
in this company , variable over@@ heads are In manufacturing .
typical examples include anc@@ illary materials that do not become part of the product and tool@@ ing .
as direct labour hours are often under the control of someone other than the manager responsible for variable over@@ heads It is important to separate these two possible explanations .
variable overhead expenditure vari@@ ances are caused by vari@@ ances in the amount of v@@ ari ­ able over@@ heads per actual direct labour hour .
it therefore compares actual overhead with what overhead should have been given the actual direct labour hours used .
in this case : ( 28@@ ,@@ 500 χ 2 ) ­ 5@@ 2,000 = US $ 5,000
variable overhead efficiency vari@@ ance = ( standard direct labour hours - actual direct labour hours ) χ standard variable overhead rate per direct labour hour .
it hand is caused by vari@@ ances in the number of direct labour hours used , which them ­ selves may result from changed volumes or from changes in the efficiency of direct labour .
this is a favourable vari@@ ance as variable manufacturing over@@ heads cost less per direct labour hour than expected .
generally speaking , variable overhead expenditure vari@@ ances are likely to be the responsibility of the overhead cost centre manager .
this is an adverse vari@@ ance as more direct labour hours were used than expected .
this vari@@ ance is not usually the responsibility of the overhead cost centres themselves and Is normally corrected automatically by improving the efficiency of the direct manufacturing departments .
labour vari@@ ances
responsibility for the two vari@@ ances usually lies with different managers .
labour efficiency vari@@ ances = ( standard hours for units produced - actual hours worked ) χ standard wage rate per hour .
it arises when actual hours per output unit differ from standard hours .
in this case : ( ( 3 χ 9,000 ) - 28@@ ,@@ 500 ) χ 3 = -@@ US $ 4,@@ 500
this is an adverse vari@@ ance because the manufacturing department used 1.@@ 500 more hours than the volume of only 9,000 units would have justified .
note that the extra hours are valued at standard , not actual , rates .
on the face of It , this Is clearly the responsibility of the direct cost centres in the Man@@ u ­ fac@@ turing department in which further investigations should start .
however , these cost centres may have been affected by other departments .
for example , the materials may have been defective and thus required re@@ work .
in this case , the investigative trail would lead on to the purchasing or inspection , department .
wage rate vari@@ ance = ( standard hourly rate - actual hourly rate ) χ actual hours .
in this case : ( 3 - 3.@@ 20 ) χ 28@@ ,@@ 500 = -@@ US $ 5,@@ 700
this is an adverse vari@@ ance as the effective wage rate per hour was higher than standard .
any unexpected increase in labour hours required is liable to result in increased overtime in the short term .
alone , it would be more than enough to explain the entire profit vari@@ ance .
materials price vari@@ ance = ( standard price - actual price ) χ quantity purchased .
it shows the effects of deviations from standards in the price paid for materials .
in this case : ( 3 ­ 2.@@ 80 ) χ 10,@@ 100 = US $ 2,@@ 0@@ 20
this is a favourable vari@@ ance as the price paid was lower than standard .
on the face of it a success for the purchasing department , as long as the lower priced materials were of standard quality .
it arises from deviations in the amount of raw materials actually used per unit of output .
this is an adverse vari@@ ance as the quantity used per unit of output was higher than stan ­ d@@ ard .
higher scrap rates may be caused either by in@@ efficiencies in manufacturing departments or by defective materials .
monitor and correct standards to reflect changes in actual usage and prices
standards that can , in principle , never be met produce constant " false alarms , " confuse analysis , and dem@@ o@@ tiv@@ ate managers .
but they should be a constant spur to improved performance .
standards must regularly be adjusted to correspond to actual organis@@ a ­ tional and technical conditions in the company .
on the other hand , too frequent changes in standards also confuse managers and may defeat the object of the whole system by hiding poor performance .
it is also important to check that standards are only being used in areas in which they can be effective .
for many companies , this condition applies less and less as modern manufacturing technology tends to fix previously variable cost .
conclusion
costing is important at different levels for all companies in a market economy .
obviously it is necessary to measure the profit a company can make on its different products or activities , but this is only one of its many applications .
costing Is also a powerful tool to influence most management decisions , such as the allocation of over@@ heads , the choice of a product portfolio or the most economic way of using expensive assets .
costing is also a planning and control tool providing relevant information for taking appropriate management decisions in a company whatever its size .
costing ¡ s a complex and Integr@@ al part of management accounting practices .
one of the key elements to survive in a competitive market place is information .
deciding how to allocate resources and other management decisions for example to products and processes , communicating business goals to the company and controlling results must be based on accurate and timely information .
starting with the big pro@@ b ­ l@@ ems is just dis@@ hear@@ tening .

some information on this brochure Use This hand@@ book outlines the ways in which fully professional bankers and entrepreneurs , both experts in their respective fields , will conduct banking transactions , especially credits .
the kind of long @@@ -@@ @ term trust@@ ful relationship between bank and SM@@ E - as it will be described in the following chapters - is what the economies in NIS should be striving for .
this hand@@ book outlines the ways in which fully professional bankers and entrepreneurs , both experts in their respective fields , will conduct banking transactions , especially cre@@ d ­ its .
a couple of years ago , however , neither the economic conditions nor the profession ­ al background of some banks in NIS were able to meet these standards .
naturally it took some time until banks had adjusted to their new responsibilities .
in the early n@@ ine@@ ties , hyper inflation made business planning and credit transactions very difficult , if not almost impossible to conduct .
legal systems that are needed to work rea ­ son@@ ably with collateral are still developing .
banking expertise , especially in the field of credit analysis , was still considered insufficient to enable banks to correctly assess the risks and opportunities associated with lending to SMEs ( St@@ el@@ zer @@@ -@@ @ O '@@ Ne@@ ill , 1995 ) .
taxes for SMEs are still prohib@@ itively high , and bureau ­ cratic regulations often stifle small scale business activities ( Western European SMEs , however , complain about taxes and regulations as well ) .
by 1997 , things have improved significantly .
legislation has been brought forward to set the framework for entrepreneurship and commercial banking .
considerable privatisation efforts have been made .
banker and entrepreneur should thus be on an equal basis .
this is especially true about the three chapters ' Appl@@ ying for bank loans , " which mirror the process of credit analysis as it is being advised to NIS banks .
more and more NIS bankers are working according to these guidelines .
nevertheless , NIS SMEs and banks financing SMEs will often find themselves in the position of pioneers vent@@ uring into new areas of business .
the challenge for both banks and SMEs is to develop the small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized sector to become a driving force of the NIS economies .
as no general scientific definition of small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises ( SM@@ E ) exists , the term " SM@@ E " Is normally used to describe companies up to a certain number of employees or a specific range of annual sales .
for statistical reasons , the following de ­ fin@@ itions apply in various countries .

the contribution SMEs make to Western nations C@@ AN@@ NOT be over@@ estimated .
they are the very backbone of many economies , as is vivi@@ dly demonstrated by Germany 's example . according to a recent study ( mit@@ tel@@ stand : NI@@ E war er so wer@@ t@@ vol@@ l , 1997 ) , 9@@ 9.@@ 6 % of all 2.1 million German enterprises are SM@@ Es@@ 1 .
they make up for 4@@ 4.1 % of Germany 's gross national product and provide 6@@ 7.@@ 9 % of all jobs and 80 % of all professional training in Germany ( Juncker , 1993 ) .
as Germany 's multinational corporations drastically reduced jobs , SMEs created more than one million new jobs in the last three years .
SMEs account for 2@@ 6.@@ 9 % of new patents .
SMEs have earned a reputation for being innovative companies that react quickly and flexi@@ bly to new situations in their markets .
they are often headed by their owners who have a high personal interest in the success of the company .
some of these SMEs - although hardly known - are world market leaders in their particular field , because they have successfully found a market niche .
why SMEs are an important market segment for banks
SMEs are the most important target group in corporate banking .
the economic significance of SMEs is reflected in the balance sheets of many banks .
at Deutsche Bank , they had a share in total lending and deposits of roughly 75 % and a share in interest income of 80 % ( Deutsche Bank AG , 1995 ) .
over the last 5 years , Great Britain 's National West@@ min@@ ster Bank has helped more than half a million people start a business .
providing banking services to SMEs is a profitable business .
market analysis and customer surveys
banks conduct extensive market research into this significant customer group to learn about the needs of SMEs .
( 1 ) The figure for the Great Britain is 2.4 million SMEs , that is 96 % of all enterprises .
53 % said that improving their value chain has top priority , especially by cutting expenses and introducing new computer systems .
40 % regard general management topics as very important . only one third of German SMEs considered financial issues their most pressing pro@@ b ­ lem , like raising equity or loans .
products and services
there are tailor @@@ -@@ @ made solutions for all banking needs .
banks have to adjust their portfolio of banking services to these changing requirements of SMEs .
if SMEs expand into new markets , be it nationally or globally , banks will follow and offer correspondent banking services or branches at the new markets .
banks offer assistance in strategy development and general management issues by specialised account managers or even consulting subsidiaries .
when it comes to cutting costs and new computers , banks can effectively reduce the cost of all payments via electronic banking products .
it goes without saying that banks are experts in providing tailor @@@ -@@ @ made solutions for all kinds of financing needs , particularly loans .
they even provide SMEs with equity or venture capital via expert subsidiaries .
the financing needs of SMEs
for every SM@@ E equity is the primary source for financing .
with equity ratios of 5 @@@ -@@ @ 15 % among German SMEs , equity alone is hardly ever to meet all the funding needs of a SM@@ E .
thus , bank loans are vital to every SM@@ E 's growth .
equity should contribute to each investment that is financed by a bank loan , showing that the entrepreneur is willing to risk a share of his own money .
for example , the purchase of a new machine tool is expected to be financed by 20 @@@ -@@ @ 30 % equity and 70 @@@ -@@ @ 80 % bank loans .
here are some examples of investments or projects that are commonly financed by bank loans .
one of the most common criteria for classi@@ fying the debt financing needs of a company is to discern whether they are short @@@ -@@ @ term , medium @@@ -@@ @ term or long @@@ -@@ @ term needs .
current asset financing Fixed asset investment Joint ventures Start ups Management @@@ -@@ @ buy @@@ -@@ @ outs ( partial or total ) Priv@@ atisation
short @@@ -@@ @ term loans are needed to enable a company to pay its current debt , mainly trade payable as they fall due .
short @@@ -@@ @ term loans help to balance the different terms between the time when current assets can be realised and be transferred into cash , and when short @@@ -@@ @ term liabilities fall due .
their purpose should be to finance one business cycle , or a temporary seasonal need .
the source of repayment Is the completion of the business cycle , that is , when all bus@@ i ­ ness activities have , hopefully , been converted into cash .
the bank 's risk assessment will focus on the liquidity of the assets of the SM@@ E and on its management 's ability to M@@ IT@@ I ­ gate risks .
medium and long @@@ -@@ @ term loans
medium and long @@@ -@@ @ term loans are normally needed to finance substantial Investments or long @@@ -@@ @ term capital expenditure .
the life of the loan should not be longer than the useful economical life of the financed asset .
the funds for repayment should be generated by the cash flow that is derived from the output or production from the financed investment .
the financial effects of such invest ­ ments have to be taken into account when setting up the financial planning ( see page 23 , Bre@@ ak even analysis and profit sensitivity ) .
a SM@@ E must disclose its financial planning showing if the future cash flow is enough to service the additional debt .
leasing means that assets , that would otherwise be financed by credit , are bought by the leasing company , which is normally a subsidiary of a bank .
so , many corporate buildings are leased .
plenty of equipment is leased , often by specialised leasing companies .
a large proportion of new car sales is financed via leasing .
the leasing contract can even contain a clause obli@@ ging the leasing company to " buy back " the financed asset at a fixed price .
this is an attractive option for clients who lease assets that will probably be technically obsolete In a couple of years , like computer systems .
besides principal and interest payments , there are a number of other elements to con ­ sider when applying for a bank loan .
they are normally due on one day 's notice .

the entrepreneur and his bank
the entrepreneur should prepare his first meetings with his banker with utmost care and diligence .
often the first contact will be at the bank 's premises , but it is advisable that the entrepreneur invite his loan officer to visit the SM@@ E 's business premises as soon as po@@ s ­ sible .
if there is a management team at the SM@@ E , the managing director and his chief financial officer should take part in the discussions with the banker .
all the necessary information should be at hand , which is easier to accomplish when meeting at the SM@@ E 's premises .
the entrepreneur should not only ask for a loan , but he can advertise his SM@@ E to the bank and require a sound financial analysis .
this can assist him in managing his business .
so he should prepare a couple of questions directed at the banker .
for exam ­ PL@@ E , an entrepreneur would like to know how the bank ass@@ esses his industry branch in particular , or what ratios tell the most for his kind of business .
bankers know a lot about what is going on in specific industries or regional areas , and most bankers are happy to share and discuss their insights .
the entrepreneur should have at hand at least the basic information which the banker needs to see .
at the end of this hand@@ book the entrepreneur will find a number of comprehensive work ­ sheets which have proven helpful in preparing meetings and negotiations with loan off@@ i ­ CER@@ s .
even more , they can help the entrepreneur to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence the course of his business .
the entrepreneur and his bank
negotiating the terms and conditions of the loan agreement
many terms and conditions of a credit contract are negoti@@ able .
the entrepreneur should be well informed about the interest rates offered by other banks .
since banking ¡ s a highly competitive business , over@@ pricing should be no option for any reasonable bank .
the interest rate could be fixed for the whole or first part of the life of the loan , or it could be floating , being adjusted to the changes in the money markets .
if the entrepreneur expects interest rates to decline , he would opt for a floating rate .
the entrepreneur should keep in mind that - from the bankers point of view - the interest rate has to reflect the risk related to the SM@@ E 's business .
the interest rate cor@@ relates with a number of other loan terms , e.g. fees or collateral .
the more fees the SM@@ E is willing to pay , the more justified are its demands that the interest rate be lowered a bit .
the more valuable the collateral is , the lesser is the credit risk , and the bank has every reason to charge a lower interest rate .
the duration of the loan is normally hardly negoti@@ able , since it is determined by the useful economic life of the financed investment .
terms of repayment
some loans are offered with a deferred start of the principal re@@ payments , giving the SM@@ E time to strengthen its liquidity .
the entrepreneur can convince the bank that his assessment of the value is correct if he has more and better background information on the state and liquidity or price stability of the collateral .
the best relationship between SM@@ E and the bank is based on the long run .
the longer a bank can retain a SM@@ E as a satisfied client , the more money it will make from this relationship .
as mutual trust builds over the years , It will become ever easier for a SM@@ E to access fresh money via its bank .
so both SM@@ E and bank benefit con ­ si@@ der@@ ably from a long term relationship .
the entrepreneur 's contact in his bank is the loan officer or account manager .
the loan officer is more to his SM@@ E client than just a credit risk analyst or a sales@@ person .
he will strive to really understand the SM@@ E 's business , its industry environment and its needs .
he has to analyse the threats and opportunities of his SM@@ E client and propose the right banking solutions for the SM@@ E 's financing needs .
customer satisfaction is all important - for SMEs and banks alike .
over the last years , studies have shown that customer satisfaction seriously affects bus@@ i ­ ness profits .
this is no less true for banking .
only customers who are satisfied with their bank for many years turn into really profitable business relationships .
this is easy to understand thinking about the expenses that come with every new loan contract .
analysing and deciding on the first loan to a SM@@ E that has been unknown to the bank so far , takes a lot of time and expertise .
thus , the first loan is very expensive and hardly ever profitable for the bank in the first year .
the better the entrepreneur knows about his business and his industry sector , the easier it should be for him to provide the banker with all the necessary information .
this is the best prerog@@ ative for building a long @@@ -@@ @ lasting relationship of mutual trust and respect .
applying for bank loans : principles of lending , information required
essential principles of lending to enterprises
knowing the basic principles of banking legislation makes It easier for the entrepreneur to understand why a bank must ask for certain information .
banks are regulated in very specific and detailed ways because they operate with other people 's money .
so , bank ­ ing laws regulate the g@@ earing or leverage ratio that measures the extent to which a bank 's funding is provided by third parties ( that is , deposits ) and by shareholders .
banks are committed by law to take special care to be informed about their credit clients ' financial situation .
they comply with this law mainly by reviewing and thoroughly analysing their corporate clients ' annual financial statements ( Br@@ ink@@ mann , 1996 ) .
factors influencing the bank 's lending decision
a study ( Ham@@ m , 1994 ) conducted by the university of Frankfurt , Germany , has shown the relevant factors that play a part in forming a lending decision .
the results of this study are important for every entrepreneur who wishes to obtain a bank loan .
knowing which information the bank needs , and how this information is weighed by the bank , should facilitate the preparation of the entrepreneur 's loan application .
bankers still rely heavily on analysing the annual financial statements of a corporation .
with 31 % , this was the most influential factor on credit decisions .
although lending dec@@ i ­ sions ought not to be based solely on the annual financial statements but ought to include further information , no credit decision must ever be made without looking at the borrower 's financial statements .
management quality contributes only 11 % to the credit decision .
its importance should Incre@@ ase , however , since management failure has proved to be the key reason for SM@@ E bankrupt@@ cies .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly , financial planning and industry sector analysis are con ­ si@@ dered less important factors with only 8 % each .
sophisticated tools such as account data analyses seem to be almost unknown ( 3 % ) , although experience and scientific tests have shown that an upcoming business crisis is fore@@ shad@@ owed in the development of a company 's bank account .

applying for bank loans : principles of lending , information required
the loan officer
the bank 's loan officer : one of the entrepreneur 's most important business partners .
he periodically meets with the entre@@ pre ­ ne@@ ur to discuss recent events or planned investments , and to see what the bank can offer to solve the SM@@ E 's financing needs .
he will propose or even decide concerning the loan application .
information and data required for raising bank loans
basic IN@@ FOR@@ M@@ ATION ON THE SM@@ E NE@@ E@@ DE@@ D FOR CRE@@ D@@ IT AL@@ LO@@ C@@ ATION
every entrepreneur who wants to approach a bank for a loan must address a number of very specific questions .
he must give the bank all the information it needs to come to a sound conclusion about the company 's cred@@ it@@ worthiness .
some of the most important questions are as follows .
every banker must see and analyse the balance sheet and profit and loss account of a prospective corporate borrower .
as the balance sheet is a statement that shows a firm 's assets and liabilities , the banker can see what a SM@@ E owns and what it owes to its cre@@ d ­ itors .
financial statements that have been audited by an in@@ de ­ pen@@ dent auditor will always be appreciated by a bank .
since the balance sheet is drawn up at the close of the SM@@ E 's fiscal year , it only represents a true and fair view of the fin@@ an ­ cial situation at this very day .
it may not be representative of the SM@@ E 's financial position at another time of the year .
interim reports
- How does the SM@@ E measure the performance of its business ? - How will the SM@@ E advance in the future ?
are there any reliable projections of sales , cost and profitability ?
interim reports give Information about the financial success during the course of the fiscal year .
they are of best use to the entrepreneur when accompanied by sound financial planning .
he is thus enabled to compare the progress of his enterprise with the plans he made .
the bank will often ask for a detailed financial planning , and for explanations of any significant divergence between the interim report and the financial plan .
interview with the bank 's loan officer
lending to SMEs : the personal relationship of entrepreneur and banker is decisive .
applying for bank loans : principles of lending , information required
for the banker , the credit interview is one of the rare opportunities to gain insights into the entrepreneurs mind @@@ -@@ @ set and integrity .
inspection of SM@@ E premises
the entrepreneur should always invite his loan officer to visit and inspect his business premises .
not only are most entrepreneurs proud to present their business on site .
they should also take the opportunity to provide additional information to the banker .
this information will often confirm the first impression the banker has received from his analysis .
the entrepreneur should prepare this on @@@ -@@ @ site @@@ -@@ @ inspection well in order to make a good impression .
balance sheet analysis
when a credit analyst has to make a credit decision , the first thing he or she will have to analyse is a firm 's balance sheet .
the balance sheet analysis alone may often not be su@@ f ­ f@@ ici@@ ent to assess a SM@@ E 's cred@@ it@@ worthiness , and other factors have to be taken into con ­ si@@ der@@ ation .
these factors , like the qualification of management , the market perspectives , the industry sector analyses , etc . , may finally be considered more important than the financial figures .
spreading ( Gab@@ ler Bank Lex@@ ik@@ on , 1988 ) is a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed method of presenting financial statements in a systematic and consistent manner .
as financial statements come in many different formats , it Is important that banks organise such data into a standard pattern .
this allows the bank to easily compare a firm 's financial performance over a period of years .
important financial details can be easily highlighted .
key ratios can be developed not only for particular balance sheet items but for entire industry sectors giving lending officers a deeper insight into a firm 's standing within its industry .
loan officers discuss balance spread@@ sheets with the entrepreneur and hand over a copy to him .
current assets
these are assets that will probably be converted into cash within 12 months of the bal ­ ance sheet date or within the normal business cycle of the company .
an explanation of the most important current issues is found below .
the firm 's management may have sound rea ­ sons to show a particularly high or low amount of cash or bank deposits .
therefore , this figure has to be compared with the previous year 's figure and those of other com ­ pan@@ ies of the same industry sector .
if a SM@@ E sett@@ les all or most of its payments via one bank , this bank will compare the cash and bank deposits statement in the balance sheets with the average amount held in its current account .
these items should always be sufficient to meet the SM@@ E 's current financial obligations .
► debtors / accounts recei@@ vable Accounts recei@@ vable should form a reasonable proportion of total assets .
too many accounts recei@@ vable consume funds and may indicate the company 's inability to make its debtors pay .
the more recei@@ vable on the balance sheet , the greater is the risk that some amounts are unlikely to be recover@@ able and have to be written off .
therefore , it is necessary to know who the key debtors are .
the company should not be dependent on a single debtor .
recei@@ vable can be turned into cash by collecting them or by selling them , for example to a factor@@ ing company .
► Sto@@ cks and inventory Sto@@ cks are valued at the initial price paid for the asset plus costs that incurred in bring ­ ing it to its present condition .
stocks can also be valued at their net real@@ is@@ able value .
► Fixed assets These are assets that the company wants to retain for a long period of time and which it does not intend to res@@ ell .
fixed assets fall into two categories , which are land / buildings and plant / machinery .
► Land and buildings Companies can value these assets at historic cost or at valuation .
the balance sheet value can be very different from the current market value .
this results in hidden reserves , since many older buildings have already been depreci@@ ated and are shown in the books with only a fraction of their current market value .
the bank will , therefore , require this information from its clients .
whenever land and buildings are needed as collateral , an independent expert 's opinion on the net real@@ is@@ able value of the real estate should be required .
this expert 's opinion will then be held in the credit files .
► Plant and machinery The type and quantity of plant and equipment are determined by the type of goods a company produces .
it can be useful to compare these fixed assets with those of other firms in the same industry to get a better Im@@ pression of the appropri@@ at@@ eness of its asset structure .
every account manager should visit his corporate clients ' sites to get an impression of his own about the equipment .
these are all amounts owed by the company that are due within twelve months of the balance sheet date .
► Cred@@ itors - trade This is the amount the firm has to pay to its suppliers .
it should form an appropriate portion of total assets .
the amount of creditors shows the degree to which the com ­ p@@ any is financed by its suppliers .
careful comparisons should be made with other companies of the same industry to see if the level of trade debtors is appropriate .
the bank has to consider whether any creditors hold security over goods supplied or other assets of the company .
► Bank over@@ drafts and current loans These short @@@ -@@ @ term bank facilities are normally provided over a considerable period of time .
it is a typical feature of an over@@ draft facility , however , that it has to be repaid on demand .
there is usually no commitment on the part of the bank to advance funds for a longer period of time .
► Medium and long @@@ -@@ @ term loans The banker will wish to know the details of these loans , that is the amount , when they are due for repayment , and whether they are secured or un@@ secured .
it is important to know whether the company is dependent on only one or two creditors .
provisions are reserves established from profits to meet future obligations like pensions .
a bank has to consider the size and the time when these obligations must be paid .
a bank has to consider how and why equity has changed over the years .
losses can only be compensated by equity .
an appropriate amount of equity is crucial for the firm 's independence and survival .
only sound equity enables a company to survive a number of bad years .
German small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized companies have equity ratios that range between 5 % and 15 % .
due to the lack of appropriate equity , 70 % of all start @@@ -@@ @ up comp@@ a ­ N@@ IE@@ s fail during the first seven years .
the profit and loss account / P & L forecast
the profit and loss account records the income and expenses of a SM@@ E during its fiscal year .
just like balance sheets , banks analyse the profit and loss statement by spreading them in a logical and consistent manner .
the sales of goods or services are normally the primary source of income for a SM@@ E .
other revenues , e.g. capital gains or extraordinary income generally account for only a tiny fraction of total sales .
how and why did sales figures change over a period of years ?
was the firm able to sell more goods ; could it charge higher prices , or both ?
in any case , total sales should increase at a rate that lies well above inflation , otherwise the company would have st@@ ag ­ n@@ ant sales .
it is always a good sign if a firm grows faster than its Industry sector and the markets where it operates .
a disproportionately strong growth of sales can , however , be a warning sign . as growth must be financed in a sound and secure manner , the company must have access to appropriate funding .
otherwise , the additional cash needed to pay for increased raw materials and personnel costs can eventually threaten a company 's solvency .
breakdown of sales figures : ever more important for the SM@@ E than for the bank .
the entrepreneur must disclose a detailed breakdown of his SM@@ E 's sales according to products , regional markets , customer groups , etc .
the enterprise 's product range should be well diversified , and the bank could ask for information on the contribution that each product group makes to the firm 's turnover .
to which countries are the goods exported ?
is there any danger that funds are not allowed to be transferred from these countries ?
has the SM@@ E taken care to safeguard against foreign exchange risks ?
what will happen if the most important customer fails to pay its bills ?
can other customers make up for this loss , or will the company suffer serious damage ?
are prices for raw materials expected to increase ?
is the SM@@ E dependent on one or a few key suppliers ?
other operating expenses include payments for electricity , le@@ ases , insurance , advertising , legal counsel , auditing , etc .
if this figure is exceptionally high , the credit analyst will ask the entrepreneur to lay open its components .
a SM@@ E 's operating profit is the result of its total revenues minus the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned items .
then , exceptional ( that is non @@@ -@@ @ operating ) income and expenses have to be con ­ si@@ dered , as well as the result of the company 's financial transactions .
the largest part of the financial result will normally be made up of interest paid for loans and interest received for bank deposits .
the cash flow is more convincing in lending decisions than sales or profit figures .
the gross cash flow ( see detailed discussion of the cash flow later in this page ) is the result of all the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned profit and loss items .
the entrepreneur should be aware that the cash flow ( and not sales or profit ) is one of the most important ratios when banks analyse financial statements .
it shows the actual amount of cash that is available to cover the expenses for interest and principal of loans , for depreciation and for new investments .
generally speaking , the cash flow consists of the net profit plus depreci@@ a ­ tion .
since depreci@@ ations are expenses that are not paid in cash , they , plus the net profit , show the amount of cash the company can operate with .
so , from the banker 's point of view , the cash flow is even more important than a firm 's net income or loss .
as fixed assets lose value over time , this loss of value has to be charged to the profit and loss account , although there are no cash expenses related to them .
depreciation me ­ th@@ ods must be disclosed in the annual report .
a bank should know about the net real@@ is@@ able value of a corporate client 's largest fixed assets , such as buildings and machines .
net income / loss
after taxes have been deduc@@ ted , the final result is the net income or loss of the SM@@ E in the respective fiscal year .
the net income , or a proportion of it , can either be paid as dividends to the shareholders , or it can be transferred to reserves ( retained earnings ) .
as many SMEs have a thin equity position , a bank nor ­ m@@ ally prefers that its borrowers transfer profits to equity .
cash flow
the cash flow gives the analyst a better understanding of a SM@@ E 's financial strength than traditional balance sheets .
calculation and forecasts
cash available to service debt
principal re@@ payments on existing debt Interest payable on existing debt
as ratios vary depending on industry sector , each SM@@ E should try to find the most meaningful ratios for its business and discuss them with its banker .
► Fun@@ ding = Shareholders ' funds / Total assets shows the degree to which shareholders ' funds support total assets .
► Return on sales = Net profit / Sales indicates the profitability of the sales of a SM@@ E .
► Asset turnover = Sales / Total assets measures the sales generated for the money invested in assets .
break even analysis and profit sensitivity
the break @@@ -@@ @ even @@@ -@@ @ analysis enables the entrepreneur to calculate which level of sales is required for a certain activity to be profitable .
it is very important to find out how variations of these parameters would affect the expected profitability .
for instance , how would an increase of 15 % of expenses for raw materials or a 10 % decline in sales prices ( e.g. to stimulate further sales ) change the overall profitability of the company ?
the break @@@ -@@ @ even @@@ -@@ @ analysis thus helps the entrepreneur to understand the elements his enterprise is most sensitive to .
industry sector analysis : threats and opportun@@ iti@@ es@@ 1
the banker has to understand the entrepreneur 's business ■ and its industry sector .
a sound lending decision can only be made if the credit officer knows and understands his SM@@ E ­ client 's industry and business .
balance sheets can only be interpreted correctly If one knows industry ­ specific ratios .
the companies currently operating in the industry will try to gain market share , or to defend their " piece of the cake . "
new competitors may try to enter the market .
new entrants may have to overcome cus ­ tom@@ er loyalty due to brand names .
brand identification is perhaps the most important entry barrier in industries like soft drinks , over @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ counter @@@ -@@ @ drugs , cosmetics , autom@@ o ­ Bil@@ es etc .
well @@@ -@@ @ established companies may still have other advantages that are not avail ­ able to potential new rivals .
these advantages can stem from their experience , proprietary technology , patents , favourable locations , government subsidies or simply from a fierc@@ ely loyal customer base .
a newcom@@ er must secure the distribution of its product .
the more limited the wholesale or retail channels are , and the more these are tied up by existing competitors , the tougher the entrance to this industry will obviously be .
sometimes a contest@@ ant even has to create its own distribution system to sur@@ mount this barrier .
finally , there are government regulations limiting access to an industry , e.g. by subsidies or by setting standards for air and water pollution , safety regulation , taxes and so on .
bargaining power of suppliers
powerful suppliers can have a significant effect on the cost structure of an industry .
they can squeeze profitability out of an industry that is unable to recover cost increases in its own prices .
by raising their prices , the soft drink concentrate producers have contributed to the erosion of profitability of bot@@ tling companies because the Bot@@ t@@ lers could not raise their prices accordingly .
this was due to intense competition from powered mi@@ xes , fruit drinks and other beverages that did not raise prices .
the labour force is a supplier as well .
labour prices will increase if it is hard to find skilled workers .
customers can force down prices or demand higher quality and more service .
they can play competitors off against each other at the expense of industry profitability .
a buyer group is powerful if , e.g. , it purchases large volumes .
this threat is bigger , the lower the switching costs are .
consumers as a buyer group may be infl@@ u ­ enced by fashion , prestige , value @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ money , price sensitivity or even environmental atti ­ tudes .
substitute products can place a ceiling on prices that can be charged for a product , or they can even make a product obsolete , as the tran@@ sist@@ or did to vacuum tubes .
in any case , it severely limits the potential of an industry .
substitute products limit earnings not only in normal times , but they can even reduce the profits that can normally be expected in boom times .
SM@@ E 's strengths and weaknesses : how does the SM@@ E react to the threats and opportunities of its industry sector ?
next , a credit analyst has to identify the particular strengths and weaknesses of a cor@@ po ­ rate client and compare them with those of other players in the same industry .
what the bank needs to find out is how the SM@@ E responds to the threats and opportunities of its industry .
only products or services that can finally be sold in the market contribute to a company 's operating income .
this may sound obvious and simple , but all too often SMEs produce rather what they like , and not what the market really wants .
as new products appear , other products fade away .
so , every product has a life cycle of its own .
as soon as a product approaches the end of its life cycle , it will no longer make money for the firm .
thus , it is important for a bank to know the product range of a corporate client , and each product 's proportion of total sales .
it consists of the four stages - market entry - market growth - market maturity - market decline .
► Market entry New products that have only recently entered a market normally have a relatively small market share .
sales are still low , but they may grow rapidly .
start @@@ -@@ @ up investments , e.g. for research and development , or for advertising , must be financed to conquer new markets .
► Market growth As soon as new products become successful , they move to a stage of growth .
revenues from sales of these products and market share increase considerably .
in this stage of the product life cycle , winning additional market share must be the top priority .
money must therefore be spent on advertising , marketing and so on .
► Market maturity M@@ ature products have already conquered a relatively large share of their market .
these well established products require hardly any new investments but yield high profits .
they make the money that the SM@@ E needs for financing the research and development or marketing expenditures for the follow @@@ -@@ @ up products in the first stages of the product life cycle .
► Market decline Fin@@ ally , both market share and growth rates decline .
new products sub@@ stituting the old appear on the scene .
sales stagn@@ ate and decline , until the product completely dis ­ appears in the long run .
these rules apply more or less to all products and services .
although they seem to be obvious , many bankers and entrepreneurs tend to forget them in the course of their daily work .
particularly owner @@@ -@@ @ operated SMEs can have a tendency to cling to products which made the company successful many years ago , but which are out@@ mo@@ ded today .
it is CR@@ U ­ cial for its chances of survival to have enough products in the maturity stage to earn the money for fostering the newcomers .
the SM@@ E 's business cycle
the business cycle : a systematic approach to analysing the strengths and weaknesses of a SM@@ E .
a tool that is helpful to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a SM@@ E in a systematic manner is the business cycle .
in order to generate new cash , the company must ensure that its customers finally pay their bills .
the following ratios provide both the entrepreneur and his banker with insights into the risks associated with the particular stages of the bus@@ i ­ ness cycle .
► Production Produc@@ tivity can be measured , for example , by comparing total output per employee with similar SMEs .
► Supply Balance sheet figures like short @@@ -@@ @ term trade payable or the credit taken by suppliers can give hints as to whether a SM@@ E is dependent on one single major supplier .
► Dem@@ and / Customers A potential borrower will also be asked to give a breakdown of his sales by major cus ­ tom@@ ers , divisions and geographic regions .
the specific business action taken to break down the marketing strategy into operational steps is called the marketing mix .
it displays the interdependence among the SM@@ E 's product , its price , the promotion and the places where it Is sold .
the banker is most interested in marketing issues because it is the customers of the SM@@ E who contribute to its revenues , and nobody else .
so the banker must come to a conclusion about the reasonable prospects of the SM@@ E 's products , their prices , their dis ­ tribution channels and the way they are promoted and advertised .
the following short check@@ list provides a few questions a banker might ask about a SM@@ E 's marketing mix .
► Price - how are the products priced in comparison to the competitors of the SM@@ E ? - is a system of reb@@ ates or bonuses established ? - how sensitive is the market to changes in prices ?
the SM@@ E 's marketing strategy and related risks
strategic marketing is more important for a SM@@ E than equity , power or relations .
the entrepreneur has to consider which of the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned features represent particular strengths of his SM@@ E that are crucial for its success or failure .
he must then decide upon the strategic positioning of his SM@@ E in order to put its strengths to best use .
generally , the three basic marketing strategies are expansion , diversification and niche player .
► Ex@@ pan@@ sion A SM@@ E that follows the path of expansion will focus on offering base products in a mass market .
they have to be cheaper than the com ­ peti@@ tors .
for example , the SM@@ E 's product range and production facilities could encourage it to follow a strategy as a low cost producer in a mass market .
the SM@@ E then has to be an expert in managing the costs of production and distribution .
the bank will scrutin@@ ise the cost positions of the profit and loss account , especially expenses for raw materials , personnel or cost of sales .
► Di@@ versi@@ fication Bran@@ ds in a broad market usually follow a policy of differentiation .
SMEs in this SE@@ G ­ ment focus on establishing and maintaining their brand .
after all , it is the brand name that customers are willing to pay for .
► Market niche A SM@@ E whose competitive advantage is very sophisticated products might choose to act as a niche player .
its products are often combined with specialised services .
they focus heavily on what the customer really needs by offering tailor @@@ -@@ @ made solutions that can be very profitable .
many of the most successful SMEs have large market shares in such niche markets .
studies have shown , however , that many SMEs do not clearly follow one of these strategies .
instead , they apply an un@@ proved mix of all three possibilities , need@@ lessly negl@@ ecting opportunities for profit .
the bank 's credit analyst has to discuss whether an entrepreneur has chosen the right competitive strategy for the specific competitive advantages of its SM@@ E , and if the SM@@ E 's business planning fits this strategy .
a bank granting a loan to a SM@@ E will there ­ fore insist on knowing which marketing strategy is applied by its borrower .
the impression a bank has of a SM@@ E 's management team can be crucial for the credit decision .
the management team of a SM@@ E must have the professional and personal qualifications that are required to lead a company .
the bank should know about the manager 's train ­ ing , experience and professional background .
a banker will often ask for his corporate client 's organisation chart .
there are firms with flat hierarch@@ ies and others with bloated bureaucracies .
the chart displays if there are departments that are responsible for strategic and financial planning , or for quality management .
many small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized companies are fully dependent on their managing di@@ re@@ c ­ tor , who is often the owner ( or one of the owners ) of the company .
these firms would get into deep trouble if their managing partner could no longer work for them , e.g. because he was injured or killed in a traffic accident .
would the company survive without his pro@@ d ­ UC@@ T development skills or his personal contacts ?
arrangements should have been made for a well @@@ -@@ @ planned qualified succession - just in case something happens .
bench@@ marking : success factors of SMEs
great Britain 's Department of Trade and Industry has conducted a comprehensive study of the most successful British SMEs .
the challenge to other entrepreneurs is to apply the lessons to their own businesses .
thus , learning from the best will help them to improve the competitiveness and success of their own SMEs .
this makes it easier to convince the banker that his SM@@ E client is a cred@@ it@@ worthy company .
the key findings of the study are as follows .
successful SMEs are led by enthusiastic and visionary entrepreneurs .
they build demanding but realistic targets into the business strategy .
an open communic@@ ative management style lives within the organisation .
and most important , they focus on their customers .
successful SMEs know their customers and anticipate their future needs .
they have a realistic understanding of their competitors and how to beat them in competition for the customers , and they know the drivers in their market .

► Emp@@ ow@@ er@@ ment Succ@@ ess@@ ful SMEs unlock the power of their people , not matter if they have five or 500 employees .
they empower all employees to make their own decisions and to focus on customers .

► Ex@@ ce@@ eding expectations Succ@@ ess@@ ful SMEs deliver products and services that exceed their customers ' expec@@ ta ­ tions .
they adopt a philosophy of total quality in all company behaviour that emph@@ a ­ si@@ ses deli@@ ghting the customers with all aspects of the product and services .
they measure customer perceptions of products and service and deliver continuous improvements in all added value aspects .
► Innovation Succ@@ ess@@ ful SMEs continuously introduce differentiated products and se@@ iv@@ ices .
they exploit new technology or legislation to drive new product innovation .
product and service are often custom@@ ised , and are delivered to the customer very fast .
as earnings could rec@@ ede and become insufficient for sen / icing a loan , banks will ask for a secondary source of repayment in the form of collateral .
if the b@@ or ­ row@@ er fails to repay his loan at the due date , the bank has the right to sell the collateral to make up for the loan loss .
this does not represent any distrust towards the entrepreneur , but is fair for both bank and SM@@ E .
common sense can help , even if there seems to be no valuable collateral .
the bank will regularly evaluate the taken collateral to ensure that the credit exposure is covered at all times .
valuation has to be brought up to date each time the credit facility is re @@@ -@@ @ assessed .
most collateral is valued at Its real@@ is@@ able market value .
this value is dis ­ counted to make up for an unpredictable decrease of value .
the entrepreneur will find it helpful to know these principles because it helps him understand how the bank would value the assets which he could offer as collateral .
sometimes lending can be as simple - and innovative - as that .
the most common types of collateral Short case studies of NIS businesses
the legal specifics of collateral vary widely from country to country .
real estate is thus valued at 60 % of market value .
it is important to understand that a building with a market value of US $ 100,000 is only good to secure a loan of US $ 60,000 .
example 1 A housing society that owned several apartment blocks applied for a loan to cover the construction expenses for a still unfinished apartment block .
the building , however , had been constructed in earlier times on communal land that did not care about its lots of previous owners .
now they had re@@ claimed their proper ­ ty , and the apartment block sat on several lots that did not belong to the housing society .
example 2 A car repair shop wanted a loan to buy some machinery .
the workshop building was located on a piece of real estate that was contaminated with decades of oil and gre@@ ase .
the loan was granted only after the soil had been cleaned .
machinery is usually valued depending on whether It can be utilis@@ ed by a prospective buyer .
example A small engineering firm in T@@ cher@@ k@@ assy , Ukraine , applied for a loan to buy a sophisticated French @@@ -@@ @ made machine tool .
as the machine tool was of a kind that could easily be sold to any other engineering company , the loan was granted and the machine tool served as collateral .
account recei@@ vable can be assigned to the bank to secure a loan , making the bank the legal owner of the recei@@ vable .
banks do not like this kind of collateral , because It is very difficult to value and to administer .
it is valued at 20 % of its face value .
example A computer shop in Minsk , Belarus , had contracted a Western company that bought computers and related services from it .
as the Western company had a good credit standing , the computer shop 's recei@@ vable could be assigned to the bank as collateral for a small loan to cover current expenses .
personal guarantees can only be valued at the cred@@ it@@ worthiness of the one who guar@@ an ­ te@@ ed to pay for the loan if the original debtor defaults .
the bank 's loan decision process
author@@ isation of loan appro@@ vals and payments
banking laws require that loan appro@@ vals and loan contracts be signed independently by two authorised bank officers .
the entrepreneur 's loan officer will be authorised to approve loan applications up to certain amount .
applications that surpass this amount must be signed by his superior or even by a superior branch or the bank 's head office .
if possible , the entrepreneur should ask to negotiate the terms and conditions of his loan directly with the bank officer who will finally decide on his request .
the initial loan approval will be thoroughly documented in the credit report .
most credit facilities are re ­ assessed on a period@@ ical basis , normally once every year .
the entrepreneur is then asked by his bank to produce the newest annual or interim reports .
they will verify if the money is indeed spent for the purpose that has been agreed upon in the loan contract , e.g. the purchase of new machinery or equipment .
the SM@@ E should select a bank that gives all this authority to its local branches .
they can decide quickly and without delay on the entrepreneur 's requests .
if a local branch has to ask head office for each decision , this will often result in delays and long processing times .
the entrepreneur should not tolerate this .
once a bank has approved a loan it requires continual monitoring .
it Is in the credit report that the compliance with banking law as well as internal Reg@@ ula ­ tions are documented .
a typical credit report has to address the following items , many of which have been supplied by the entrepreneur .
the bank 's loan decision process
valuation data - status of collateral - valuations of values , especially with real @@@ -@@ @ estate financing - security margins - correspondence with client
factors influencing the pricing of bank loans
why are bank loans so expensive ?
the price charged for a credit must cover the bank 's administrative and refinancing expenses .
from the banker 's point of view , it is most important that the margin reflects the risk that is associated with each particular credit .
the various factors influencing the pricing decisions are as follows .
obviously , premiums will be charged for complex transactions that require a lot of ana ­ ly@@ tical skills and expert knowledge .
small amounts often require almost the same time for analysis and administration as large fa ­ c@@ ilities , which should be relatively cheaper .
the credit risk
the bank 's loan decision process
relationship with counterparts
a bank may consider if it wants to win new business from a particular SM@@ E and then charge a preferential price .
attractive terms and conditions are in the bank 's own interest , because extending an existing business comes much cheaper than winning new ones .
the SM@@ E and its bank in times of crisis
there goes a saying that " banks lend umbrel@@ las in the sunshine , and when it starts rain ­ ing , they want to have their umbrel@@ las back . "
though this may sometimes still be true , in most cases banks have the will to keep a SM@@ E going once it has run into financial diff@@ ic@@ ul ­ ties .
the probability of recovering bad loans Is much higher when the troubled SM@@ E sur ­ Vi@@ ves to resume its interest and principal payments .
banks employ risk management instruments to foresee an upcoming financial crisis with a SM@@ E .
once the crisis is there , SM@@ E and bank often join efforts to rescue the SM@@ E .
risk management instruments of banks
credit policy and loan portfolio management
the bank 's head office formul@@ ates a credit policy which must be followed by each unit .
the credit portfolio planning and controlling must be in coherence with credit policy .
the entrepreneur of a SM@@ E will nor ­ m@@ ally be in contact with a local bank branch .
his bank branch will sometimes have to ask for additional information simply because it has to follow orders from head office .
instruments indicating early warning signs
banks have developed early warning systems that give advance notice when the fin@@ an ­ cial situation of a SM@@ E deterior@@ ates .
an entrepreneur should not hesitate to ask his banker which instruments he applies , and to share his insights with him .
account data analysis and risk scoring are the two most commonly employed instr@@ u ­ ments to provide advance signals of loans turning bad .
the entrepreneur should ask his bank to explain its risk management instruments .
an entrepreneur , on the other hand , could ask his bank to disclose its account data analysis to him on a regular basis .
by use of an extensive check@@ list , risk scoring ear@@ marks each single credit facility with a rating ranging , e.g. , from " 1 " for excellent to " 6 " for a bad , un@@ recover@@ able loan .
over the life of the loan , changes in this rating provide the loan officer with a clear trend of how the borrowing SM@@ E develops - at a single glance .
moreover , the aggregation of all ratings shows the distribution of ratings and allocated lending volume , allowing the bank to man ­ age its credit portfolio .
the entrepreneur could ask his banker about the average rating of SMEs in his industry sector .
banks will concentrate on a couple of financial indicators .
they are easy to follow and deliver sufficiently reliable warning signs , as experience has shown .
as the entrepreneur can monitor these ratios by himself and much earlier than his banker , they provide a vener@@ able tool for steering his SM@@ E .
joint crisis management by SM@@ E and its bank
if a SM@@ E runs into financial difficulties , then its bank has to recover the credit facilities at stake .
the entrepreneur wants to keep his SM@@ E alive .
the entrepreneur and his loan off@@ i ­ cer will discuss which strategy is to be pursued .
the bank 's alternatives are - sell the collateral , if the collateral is valuable enough - liquid@@ ate the borrowing company / bankruptcy - continue the business as a going concern .
full co @@@ -@@ @ operation of SM@@ E and bank is essential .
in the majority of cases the bank 's recovery will be maxim@@ ised if the SM@@ E is preserved .
so entrepreneur and bank often share - at least partly and for different reasons - the same objectives .
in a joint effort they have to consider which of the following actions are to be taken .
many banks give assistance in re@@ organising the SM@@ E and its funding structure to make it viable once more .
the bank may agree to extend credit facilities , roll over interest and to advance further money to keep the SM@@ E going .
resources have to be concentrated on these parts .
certain changes in management and operations will be necessary , and a joint action plan should be developed In order to control the reconstruction process .
in most cases , loan losses do not occur all of a sudden .
both SM@@ E and bank should therefore develop a relationship of mutual trust and openness , discussing the business of the SM@@ E in detail .
both parties will then identify upcoming pro@@ b ­ l@@ ems early on , when there Is enough time to solve most financial problems .

work@@ sheets concerning the information and fields of analysis required for loan requests
the following work@@ sheets have proved helpful for entrepreneurs , especially for the preparation of credit interviews and loan negotiations with his bank .
these check@@ lists have been developed by bankers specialised in financing SMEs , in order to share comprehensive management knowledge that is often missed in SMEs .
of course , not all the questions are Import@@ ant for all enterprises ; some questions may be less important ( e.g. , questions about exports and international business if the company has purely domestic operations ) .
this should make it easier to persuade your banker to grant a loan .
whenever you hit a " No " -@@ answer , you should think about the risks this may pose to your enterprise and about which measures you should take .
the following questions will give you a first impression of the company 's market position .
any company which wants to stand its ground in the competition for market shares has to acquire a strong image in Its target markets .
customers Does the company achieve half of Its sales volume with at least three different cus ­ tom@@ ers ?
does the company have an efficient distribution network ?
does the share of the company 's real product novel@@ ties ( not older than five years ) amount to more than 20 % ?
is a market growth to be expected for substantial parts of the company 's product range ?
international business Is the company in a position to successfully deal with international competitors ?
is the company able to sol@@ icit new customers abroad with its current products ?
eight crucial questions about management quality ( Deutsche Bank )
the development and improvement of management quality is one of the most important strategic requirements at small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized companies .
when planning its long @@@ -@@ @ term investments , did the company take other choices into con ­ si@@ der@@ ation e.g. strategic alliances or clever acquisitions ?
does the company offer professional training courses ?
information and motivation Does the company have an efficient system for incentives and performance control ? yes D No D
does the company motivate its employees by particular social contributions ?
succession arrangement Is the company able to survive without the managing directors product development skills / his personal contacts ?
did the company make arrangements for a well planned qualified management su@@ c@@ ces ­ sion ?
eight crucial questions about the financial situation ( Deutsche Bank )
due to structural changes , small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized companies should in time be prepared to raise additional funds and to include them in systematic medium and long @@@ -@@ @ term financial planning .
revenues and profit Is the company 's return on total assets above the current market interest rate ?
liquidity / Sol@@ v@@ ency Does the company make use of liquidity planning and control ?
capital structure Is the company 's capital structure sufficient to succeed with a new strategic orientation ( e.g. expanding into new markets ) ?
is the company 's equity ratio equivalent to the usual height of that of a sound and eff@@ i ­ cient company in its industry sector ?
six crucial questions concerning risk management ( Deutsche Bank 's )
risk control affects different business areas of small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized companies .
especially during good times , too little attention is paid to securing the achieved position .
seemingly insignificant risks in different business areas can accumulate and jeopar@@ dise the company 's future success or even its very existence .
did the company take measures in order to make its currency risks ( more ) calcul@@ able ? yes D No D
is the company guarded against damages to its assets and losses of its earnings ( e.g. by the help of an Insurance policy covering these risks ) ?

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
in its first four years of operation , 1991 @@@ -@@ @ 1994 , T@@ ac@@ is has committed EC@@ U 1,@@ 7@@ 57 million to launch more than 2,000 projects .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and fe@@ as@@ ab@@ ill@@ ty studies .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
situations can be similar , but are seldom identical .
this manual was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the project described here@@ after .
some information on the project
this manual provides sugar be@@ et grow@@ ers with practical recommendations for each crop stage .
the recommendations are based on locally available inputs ; they are ideally suited for Krasnodar agro @@@ -@@ @ climatic conditions and should be adjusted for regions with significantly different conditions .
the production of a profitable sugar be@@ et crop is demanding , requiring a high level of skill , knowledge and capital investment .
the profit margin from sugar be@@ et production has suffered in recent years with increased costs of chemicals , fuel , labour and machinery .
farms will have to adjust to produce sugar more economically and so remain competitive .
but , Im@@ proved varieties alone are unlikely to provide all the answers .
the be@@ et crop needs to be grown to a high stan ­ d@@ ard to allow varieties to reach their true potential .
most would recognise the Import@@ ance of the earliest possible full @@@ -@@ @ leaf can@@ op@@ y in maxim@@ is ­ ing yield potential .
scientists within the NIS have done much to develop sugar be@@ et production , and this document aims to complim@@ ent their work .
the Director and staff of the Gul@@ kevich Institute for Su@@ gar and Su@@ gar Be@@ et Research , especially Sergey N@@ ali@@ v@@ ai@@ ko for his guidance and friendship .
all those other farms visited in the Kub@@ an during the last two years for their help in answering so many questions .
figure 1 : most suitable regions for sugar be@@ et crop .
by the very nature of be@@ et plants converting sunlight into sugar , and the need to absorb carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to aid the process , loss of water from the plant is inevitable .
if the plants lose more water than they can absorb from the soil , then they wil@@ t , stop taking in CO2 , stop growing , and therefore stop producing sugar .
serious wil@@ ting leads to eventual leaf death , and sunlight is wasted .
however , no advantage is gained by producing extra luxur@@ i@@ ant leaf growth .
optimum total ground cover , once reached , is sufficient for maxim@@ ising production from available sunlight and water resources .
different plant stages of sugar be@@ et
► fol@@ i@@ age must inter@@ cept as much sunlight as possible during the growing season .
be@@ et crop production
on no account should sugar be@@ et be grown closer than every third year ( 2 year break ) .
in general , the ro@@ tations within NIS are sufficiently wide and diverse to avoid serious dis ­ ease or soil p@@ est build @@@ -@@ @ up .
even with possible In@@ c@@ enti@@ ves to increase be@@ et production in the future , the importance of ro@@ tations should always be born in mind .
as more commercial pressure Is applied to farms , the temptation to shor@@ ten rot@@ ational breaks may arise .
in areas of low p@@ H acid soils , the place of sugar be@@ et in the rotation should dictate the application of lime to recti@@ fy any ac@@ idity problem ( see crop nutrient section ) .
the soil should be free of comp@@ action to encourage deep ro@@ oting and maximum Mo@@ is ­ ture extraction , as well as allowing free drainage .
a progressive approach to soil preparation should lead , by sowing time , to • a level surface for efficient drilling operations
• a soil un@@ comp@@ acted to full ro@@ oting depth , to allow deep ro@@ oting and free drainage .
by avoiding deep cultiv@@ ations in the spring , this we@@ ather@@ ed soil can be kept In the depth of drilling zone .
tractor whe@@ eling damage should be avoided in the spring , so eliminating the need for deep cultiv@@ ations .
lime and fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er ( not nitrogen ) is best applied on the previous crop stub@@ ble .
shallow cultiv@@ ations will also encourage growth of weed species capable of autumn ger@@ min@@ ation and help to control per@@ ennial we@@ eds such as cre@@ eping th@@ ist@@ les by breaking up roots .
in the author 's opinion the quality of Pl@@ ough@@ s in NIS is generally poor , and does not lend itself to good primary soil preparations , even when used with care .
the presence of comp@@ acted layers In the soil profile creates conditions for poor ro@@ oting and inadequate plant growth .
all fields to be cro@@ pped with sugar be@@ et should be examined for comp@@ action in the prev@@ i ­ O@@ Us crop by digging Inspection pits and examining ro@@ oting systems , comparing areas of good and poor growth .
in the absence of a pan or comp@@ action , no further remedi@@ al action need be taken .

the fitting of wings to the sub@@ soil T@@ ine will improve the effectiveness by increasing the upward soil disturbance .
se@@ ed@@ bed preparation
deep cultivation In the spring should be avoided , and often a light har@@ row @@@ -@@ @ type cultiv@@ ator will be sufficient .
excess passes destroy structure , cause comp@@ action and , importantly , waste time and fuel .
ideally , cultiv@@ ators should have straight t@@ ines to avoid bringing un@@ we@@ ather@@ ed soil to the surface .
variety selection
farms should choose varieties based on the following criteria .
when grown to a high standard of hus@@ band@@ ry , local varieties will perform to very satisfactory levels .
sugar yield ( combination of root yield and sugar concentration ) . 2 .
resistance to disease , i.e. cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a , and tolerance to local conditions , i.e. drought , stress , etc . 3 .
be@@ et juice quality - varieties should exhibit a low level of im@@ pur@@ ities in extrac@@ table juice . 4 .
resistance to bol@@ ting , particularly In northern regions , when a drop in temperature may be experienced following drilling .
it is not the intention of this document to recommend varieties from whatever source , local or imported .
vari@@ etal su@@ itability for various regions of the NIS will differ greatly .
domestic varieties are selected for local conditions , and imported seed should be intr@@ o ­ duc@@ ed to regions based on their local su@@ itability .
grow@@ ers should satisfy themselves that they know the characteristics of all currently available varieties .
the advantages of imported , p@@ ell@@ eted seeds is more often associated with the p@@ ell@@ eting process giving better seed quality than with vari@@ etal characteristics .
local varieties , bred and developed to suit local conditions , have benefits that are all too frequently ignored by those involved in be@@ et production .
when Russian varieties were p@@ ell@@ eted and compared with imported seeds , they stood up well to the test .
in 1993 and 1994 the sugar project in Krasnodar dr@@ illed into trials local seed varieties SK@@ O 42 and MS 34 , that had been taken to England and p@@ ell@@ eted to European stan ­ d@@ ards .
in trial the varieties compared very favour@@ ably with imported varieties , producing very acceptable sugar yields in both years ( see table 1 ) .
most farms do not grow their crop to these high standards .
it is the preparation and presentation of the local seeds that is the problem , not the varieties .
grow@@ ers should also encourage the seed supply industry to improve their standards , as the future improvements in production depend upon it .
most local varieties in the NIS are mon@@ og@@ er@@ m varieties , produced from mon@@ og@@ er@@ m male ster@@ ile plants with multi@@ ger@@ m pol@@ lin@@ ators , producing a mixture of mon@@ og@@ er@@ m and multi@@ ger@@ m seeds , relying on seed processing to remove the multi@@ ger@@ m material .
Mon@@ og@@ er@@ m seed produced is said to be > 90 % mon@@ og@@ er@@ m . grow@@ ers should never be satisfied with , or accept , poor quality seed . the end cost is too great .
hybri@@ ds are being introduced that will be almost entirely mon@@ og@@ er@@ m , relying less on seed processing to remove multi@@ ger@@ m material .
grow@@ ers should check samples of seed delivered for multi@@ ger@@ m material , ger@@ min@@ ation and quality of seed dressing with fun@@ g@@ icide and insectici@@ de , being prepared to return poor samples to the processor or supplier .
the quality standards , as to ger@@ min@@ ation and multi@@ ger@@ m levels , should be monitored .
ger@@ min@@ ation should be > 80 % , and preferably > 90 % . Mon@@ og@@ er@@ m seeds should be at least 95 % of sample or higher . size grading
• Se@@ eds graded 3.5 @@@ -@@ @ 4.5 mm should have at least 7@@ 0,000 seeds per kg . • Se@@ eds graded 4.5 @@@ -@@ @ 5.5 mm should have at least 4@@ 5,000 seeds per kg .
these are the basic criteria that locally processed be@@ et seeds should adhere to .
nitrogen requirements should be based on previous cro@@ pping and soil type . other nutrients should be determined by soil analysis .
table 2 : example of approximate nutrients removed from the soil by a good be@@ et crop of 50 tonnes per hectare .

PO
the regular analysis of soils will update this information , and fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ing for crop needs can then be adjusted .
soil sampling and analysis is an important aid to decision making on farms , and should be carried out with extreme care .
samples should be representative of the whole field to produce a good average .
the p@@ H status of soils for sugar be@@ et production Is one of the most important elements of analysis .
a good crop of be@@ et C@@ AN@@ NOT be grown on acid soil .
any attempt to do so is a waste of time , energy and money .
any other inputs applied to a crop grown under acid conditions is a complete waste .
it will grow under al@@ kal@@ ine conditions , but prefers a neutral soil , taking up other crop N@@ utr@@ i ­ ents most efficiently from most soils with a p@@ H of 6.5 @@@ -@@ @ 7.0 .
however , some areas are likely to experience problems If lime Is not used regularly .
thorough incorporation of lime is recommended to avoid surface ac@@ idity after pl@@ ough@@ ing .
this is of particular benefit on lighter soils .
by using farm yard man@@ ures , farms should save on in@@ organic fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er application , therefore saving money .
farms with a supply of farm yard man@@ ure and sl@@ ur@@ ries should take into account the N@@ utr@@ i ­ ent value they are applying .
many experiments in UK , over several decades , have confirmed that only modest amounts of nitrogen are needed for maximum sugar yield .
even when be@@ et tops are being utilis@@ ed for animal feed , the optimum rate should not be increased above 150 kg per ha , as higher rates will de@@ press sugar yield .
high nitrogen rates increase amino N levels in the roots , resulting in poor extraction of sugar during processing .
in most European countries , high amino N levels in be@@ et attract a financial penalty from processors .
120 kg per ha of nitrogen should be considered the maximum , and then only on light sandy soils .
medium tex@@ tured soils need no more than 100 kg , with even lower rates needed by soils with high organic content ( down to 50 kg ) .
" excess nitrogen fills the eyes but not the pocket ! "
timing of nitrogen application
if application is made in the spring ( as a top dressing ) , it will be more readily available to be@@ et plants , and less nitrogen per hectare would need to be applied .
the current practice , in the Kub@@ an and elsewhere in NIS , of pl@@ ough@@ ing down nitrogen in the autumn should be reviewed .
the waste of nitrogen and loss of production makes no economic sense .
► 30 kg per ha applied to the se@@ ed@@ bed before preparing land for drilling .
phosph@@ ate and pot@@ ash
as these two nutrients are often applied together , at the same time of year , they will be considered together .
Ol@@ sen method of extraction ) .
sugar be@@ et has a high response to pot@@ ash , and for maximum yields needs an adequate supply .
on lighter soils , the pot@@ ash levels in the soil available to plants will fall , if adequate main@@ te ­ n@@ ance levels are not applied through the rotation .
both phosph@@ ate and pot@@ ash can be satis@@ factor@@ ily pl@@ ough@@ ed down In the autumn / early winter , except on light soils , when pot@@ ash Is prone to being le@@ ached from the top@@ soil .
in this case , application in January or February onto the level pl@@ ough@@ ed land will prove b@@ en ­ ef@@ icial .
be@@ et responds to sodium , and , for maximum yield , needs an adequate supply of both potassium and sodium .
whilst some substitution by one with the other can occur , both are essential for yield .
sodium Is more important on low pot@@ ash level , dry light soils , being less important on moisture ret@@ entive medium texture soils , or those with high organic levels .
soils with less than 20 mg / l@@ t available N@@ a respond to applications of sodium .
soils above 40 mg / l@@ t N@@ a have shown little or no response in Europe .
magnesium sulph@@ ate or cal@@ c@@ ined mag@@ nes@@ ite can be applied to overcome any likely def@@ i ­ ci@@ encies .
it should be applied with other nutrients and pl@@ ough@@ ed down .
the two most likely to be a problem , and cause nutrient deficiencies , are Bor@@ on ( B ) and Man@@ gan@@ ese ( M@@ n ) .
bor@@ on deficiency is identified by sh@@ riv@@ elling and black@@ ening of central leaves , killing the growing point .
any farm with doubts should have soil samples checked .
if samples show less than 0.5 mg / l@@ t ( hot water method of extraction ) , then deficiencies are likely .
0.5 @@@ -@@ @ 1.0 mg / l@@ t would lead to po@@ s ­ sible problems .
above 1.0 mg / l@@ t problems are unlikely to occur .
severe Man@@ gan@@ ese deficiency can decrease sugar yield by up to 30 % .
the deficiency usually shows as yellow areas between the se@@ ed@@ ling leaf veins in late May / early June ( or earlier ) .
as it develops , these areas become light coloured , sun@@ ken angular spots , known as spec@@ k@@ led yel@@ lows .
the plants tend to have an upright growth pattern , and leaf margins cur@@ l inward and upward .
be@@ et is particularly susceptible when grown on al@@ kal@@ ine soils above 6.5 p@@ H , but symptoms can occur on most soils .
man@@ gan@@ ese deficiency can be controlled by the use of man@@ gan@@ ese sulph@@ ate at 10 kg per hectare , spra@@ yed as soon as symptoms appear .
in severe cases , a second or even third application may be necessary .
if numbers are too high , it can lead to harvest difficulties , with small roots being lost through machinery at harvest .
if numbers are too low , it will not allow plants to cover the ground , intercep@@ ting less sunlight per hectare and reducing sugar yield .
also , a lower population crop is less able to compete with we@@ eds .
low population can also cause H@@ ar ­ v@@ est problems , by making crown removal difficult .
agr@@ onom@@ ic practice can and does have a very influential effect on population , and every effort must be made to encourage young se@@ ed@@ lings to develop and reach their true potential .
the effects of post @@@ -@@ @ drilling hus@@ band@@ ry are important , and can seriously affect and determine final crop performance .
drilling - Stan@@ ha@@ y 12 row belt type precision drill , with gr@@ anu@@ le applic@@ ator for soil insectici@@ des , as used at the Gul@@ k@@ ev@@ ichi Su@@ gar In@@ stit@@ ut@@ e@@ in 1993 and 1994 .
treating be@@ et crops in this way will incur a considerable yield penalty .
where the crop is dr@@ illed to stand , establishment percentage can have a great influence on yield .
whilst some of this was due to poor drill per ­ formance or lack of attention to drill settings , often the problem was the seed itself , being poorly graded and presented .
unfortunately , most NIS seeds do not reach these ideals , and often seeds presented for precision drilling are un@@ satisfactory .
only consider drilling to stand if the seed quality Is suitable , and the drilling machine is capable of reasonable precision .
a row width of 45 cm is commonly used in NIS .
this is ideal as it allows optimum plant populations , without having to resort to seed spac@@ ings that are too close .
seed spac@@ ing should be determined after predicting the establishment percentage , i.e. laboratory ger@@ min@@ ation ( available from seed supplier ) less the field factor . this factor incorporates known criteria of the field .
be@@ et seed ger@@ min@@ ates slowly when soil temperature is below 5 ° C , and not at all below 3 ° C.
soil temperature whilst a guide , should not on Its own determine sowing date .
Fl@@ uctu@@ a ­ tions in soil temperature can prove misleading .
usually spring temperatures will increase steadily , and it is In this environment that be@@ et establishes well .
a forced se@@ ed@@ bed usually gives poor establishment and yield results .
a few days delay , waiting for conditions to improve , is usually worthwhile , as better establishment and crop growth will compensate for time delay .
late drilling will reduce yield potential , so every effort should be made to drill at the Op@@ ti ­ m@@ um time .
two weeks delay in drilling can equ@@ ate to a 10 % reduction in yield .
the aim is to cover seeds with 25 @@@ -@@ @ 30 mm of fir@@ med soil .
in this case , increase drilling depth to place seed In moisture .
rapid establishment of the be@@ et crop is the most important aspect of its hus@@ band@@ ry .
young se@@ ed@@ lings are most at risk from p@@ est attack , chemical damage , mechanical dam ­ age and weather damage .
the sooner the crop is established with six true leaves , the less likely it is to be at risk .
all operations should be to encourage rapid establishment , not de@@ tract from it . this should be considered at all times .
this method , whilst crude , will usually indicate ger@@ min@@ ation percentage and a guide to establishment .
there is a new drill , developed in the Stavropol region by company Agr@@ i T@@ ek , that is encouraging .
drilling too fast , incorrect selection of cell wheels , worn and poorly maintained equipment are all reasons observed as leading to poor results .
uniform depth is as important as even spac@@ ing along the row , and care should always be taken when setting depth .
the speed of drilling can greatly influence the seed spac@@ ing , and observation has shown dr@@ ills operating on farms in Krasnodar in excess of 5 km per hour .
at this speed seed selection is inaccurate , and cou@@ l@@ ters bounce at high speed , giving poor depth control .
key PO@@ IN@@ TS IN THE FI@@ EL@@ D ► Check sowing depth frequently .
crop protection and spraying
there are various alternatives for spraying .
their effect on the final result can be imp@@ or ­ tant .
they are detailed in the following paragraph .
workers who are handling pesticides should be trained in their use , and understand how to handle them correctly .
it is unfortunate that currently , the only source of p@@ ell@@ eted seeds is from seed companies outside of NIS .
if be@@ et seeds can ger@@ min@@ ate and establish themselves rapidly , they are usually able to out@@ grow any serious problems from se@@ ed@@ ling pests .
the threshold level at which to spray should be determined by local knowledge based on previous experience of damage levels .

crop protection and spraying
update kits are In various stages , and range from no@@ zzle with conversion holders through to filter kits , to complete sets comprising pump , pressure regulator , filters and no@@ zz@@ les .
these kits are of benefit , not just for the be@@ et crop , but for all crops spra@@ yed on the farm .
the savings in chemical through more efficient use will make an investment in these kits self @@@ -@@ @ financing .
precise and safe application depends on equipment being in good condition .
farms should seriously consider the purchase of spra@@ yers and fitting of spra@@ yer update kits , available from various suppliers in Europe .
often these are available from chemical suppliers as well , who may subsi@@ dise the kits when chemicals are purchased .
it is a system of crop management that has much to recommend it for use in Russia and the NIS .
this technique cuts chemical costs , but demands accurate timing of applications .
equipment must be in good condition , well maintained , with no@@ zz@@ les of the correct size and free from wear .
most sugar be@@ et her@@ bic@@ ides approved for contact weed control in Russia are suitable for low volume application , as are most of the residual or contact / residual chemicals .
most chemicals are suitable for spray volumes at 80 @@@ -@@ @ 120 It per hectare .
spra@@ yer pressure should be 34 bars .
higher pressure has no advantage , so no@@ zzle selection should be based on these operating pressures .
farms should seriously consider the use of band spra@@ yers .
they offer the opportunity to save considerably on chemical costs .
the method of application being an over row band spra@@ yer covering 12 or 18 rows at a time .
crop protection and spraying
the capital cost of band spra@@ yers is very soon recovered from savings in chemical cost .
band spraying and inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations have a place on NIS farms , provided that band spra@@ yers can be built locally .
band spra@@ yers can be built on farms from kits provided by various spray equipment manufacturers in Europe .
the application of all her@@ bic@@ ides from pre @@@ -@@ @ emergence on@@ ward is possible with a band spra@@ yer .
inter row cultiv@@ ations and band spraying
inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultivation coupled with band spraying offers a cheap alternative method of weed control , and is both safe to the crop and economic .
the inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations should be with ho@@ e type or ro@@ tary machines .
side guards should be used on inter @@@ -@@ @ row ho@@ es to stop smo@@ ther@@ ing of young plants .
three or four Inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations may be necessary to control we@@ eds , the only limit to the number of passes being the stage of crop growth .
we@@ eds in be@@ et crop - by this stage they should have been spra@@ yed at least once using the low dose programme . Δ
strong growing we@@ eds , such as A@@ mar@@ an@@ th and Chen@@ op@@ o@@ dium with woo@@ dy fi@@ br@@ ous stems , and grass we@@ eds can seriously hinder top ­ ping and harvesting , causing significant harvest losses and root damage .
per@@ ennial weed control
the use of stub@@ ble cleaning cultiv@@ ations during suitable weather conditions can prove very useful in controlling per@@ ennial grass we@@ eds such as couch grass or other r@@ hi@@ zom@@ inous gr@@ asses .
whilst gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate is expensive , the long @@@ -@@ @ term benefits of achieving good control will be reflected in the be@@ et crop , as well as in other crops in the rotation .
cre@@ eping th@@ ist@@ le is the one broad @@@ -@@ @ leav@@ ed per@@ ennial that can be controlled successfully in the crop by the use of Clo@@ py@@ r@@ al@@ id ( L@@ on@@ tre@@ l ) , giving effective control .
per@@ ennial gr@@ asses can be checked or partially controlled in crop with Flu@@ az@@ if@@ op @@@ -@@ @ P @@@ -@@ @ But@@ yl ( F@@ us@@ il@@ ade ) , or other approved grass weed her@@ bic@@ ides .
effective control of annual broad @@@ -@@ @ leav@@ ed we@@ eds means controlling those likely to com ­ Pet@@ e with the growing crop and / or cause problems at harvest .
this control is best achieved by a sequence of her@@ b@@ icide treatments , as described later in this chapter .
often , this leads to excessive cultiv@@ ations to incorporate chemicals , drying out or spo@@ iling se@@ ed@@ beds , and are not recommended in this document .
per@@ ennial broad @@@ -@@ @ leav@@ ed and grass we@@ eds are best controlled in the rotation prior to be@@ et crop .
the activity of these her@@ bic@@ ides depends on soil moisture and rainfall following applic@@ a ­ tion .
poor activity can be expected in dry spring conditions , and so pre @@@ -@@ @ emergence appl@@ i ­ c@@ ations should not always be relied upon to give the control necessary .
at least some control of we@@ eds will have taken place and allowed some extra time between the timed applications .
this limitation is usually overcome by using mixtures with other chemicals .
their main advantages are • Control of a broad spectrum of emerged we@@ eds . • Re@@ si@@ dual action against we@@ eds before they can emerge .
planning a system of weed control
there are several alternative programmes that can be followed in order to control we@@ eds under the European crop management system .
weed stage
* if am@@ bro@@ sia or th@@ ist@@ le are present in large numbers or more advanced size , increase L@@ on@@ tre@@ l to 0.5 I
* spray when grass we@@ eds , bri@@ st@@ le fo@@ x@@ tail , can@@ ary grass , couch grass are at 23 leaf stage , for maximum control
weed growth is the important criteria , not be@@ et plant growth stage .
alternative programmes
as previously mentioned , this is only one of several alternative programme options .
this programme proved successful in 1993 / 94 , but so equally could any of the other alter@@ na ­ tives .
Clo@@ py@@ r@@ al@@ id ( L@@ on@@ tre@@ l ) and a suitable grass weed her@@ b@@ icide , such as F@@ us@@ il@@ ade , Zel@@ lic or F@@ us@@ or Super , can be incorporated into the programme as required .
main PO@@ IN@@ TS TO FO@@ L@@ LO@@ W FOR S@@ UC@@ CE@@ SS@@ F@@ U@@ L weed CON@@ TRO@@ L US@@ ING LO@@ W dose , LO@@ W V@@ OL@@ U@@ ME TEC@@ H@@ NI@@ Q@@ UE : ► Use a pre @@@ -@@ @ emergence residual her@@ b@@ icide ( not pre @@@ -@@ @ drilling ) .
choice should be influenced by soil type and weed spectrum .
timing of this first post @@@ -@@ @ emergence spray is the key to success in controlling we@@ eds in the crop .
in warm spring weather conditions , as usually experienced in Krasnodar , we@@ eds will ger@@ min@@ ate and grow rapidly .
some species may only be at the susceptible stage for adequate control for a matter of two or three days , especially if a pre @@@ -@@ @ emergence spray has been omitted from the programme .
never allow we@@ eds to grow beyond the co@@ ty@@ le@@ don stage , before being spra@@ yed with the first post @@@ -@@ @ emergence application .
► The following second or third sp@@ rays will depend on weather conditions , weed spectrum and growth .
as temperatures increase and soils warm , weed growth will be more rapid .
the interval between sp@@ rays needs to be guided by observation , not by date or any rigid forward planning .
if the crop is under stress from p@@ est attack or weather conditions , be prepared to change the programme .
product labels will indicate stress conditions to be avoided when spraying with specific chemicals .
none of these can be arrived at without constant observation .
all fields should be inspected thoroughly , at least every three days .
► Check chemicals are compatible together . always check labels .
in a wet@@ ter growing year such as 1993 , inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations can neg@@ ate most of the benefits of overall spraying , encouraging weed seeds to ger@@ min@@ ate in the newly disturbed soil conditions .
in a wet@@ ter year , these cultiv@@ ations could prove the opposite and cause more clo@@ ds to form .
soil loos@@ ening cultiv@@ ations to create a soil mul@@ ch to help prevent moisture loss from cracked , drying soils can prove beneficial .
any later will damage leaves and affect yield , whilst cultivating too early will interfere with weed control by the spray programme .
trials conducted in Krasnodar in 1993 and 1994 suggest that be@@ et can be grown equal ­ ly effectively in the Kub@@ an without any inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations .
when band spraying , inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations to control we@@ eds is integral to the system ( see band spraying section ) .
inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations - good quality work@@ . t >
p@@ est and disease control
p@@ est and disease attacks cause plants to lose leaf area , and consequently have less leaf ground cover to inter@@ cept sunlight .
p@@ est damaged or disease affected leaves are less efficient at intercep@@ ting and converting sunlight into sugar , so sugar yield potential is lost .
the treatment of seed with a fun@@ g@@ icide and insectici@@ de is essential , particularly when crops are dr@@ illed to a stand .
this insurance against p@@ est and disease attacking the young se@@ ed@@ lings is important if crop establishment is to be at optimum levels .
Russian seeds are usually treated with carbo@@ fur@@ an ( Fur@@ adan ) to protect the seed from fle@@ a beet@@ les and we@@ evils , applied as a dressing to the natural seeds .
European p@@ ell@@ eted seeds usually incorporate a fun@@ g@@ icide ( thir@@ am or hym@@ exac@@ ol ) , plus an insectici@@ de such as im@@ id@@ ac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d ( gau@@ cho ) .
p@@ ell@@ eting allows fun@@ g@@ ic@@ ides and insectici@@ des to surround the seed in a more measured dose , offering much more effective control .
there is no question that p@@ ell@@ eting or sl@@ ur@@ ry coating of Russian seeds would improve plant establishment and early plant vig@@ our .
if soil pests are considered a serious problem , then farms should consider using a Gr@@ an ­ ular insectici@@ de , applied into or around the seed fur@@ row at drilling .
identification of the real cause of plant loss is critical If control measures are to be effective .
it is assumed that , in a normal year , 25 % of se@@ ed@@ lings that do not emerge are killed by soil pests or disease .
a following spray to control fle@@ a beet@@ les and we@@ evils may be necessary .
be@@ et se@@ ed@@ lings are slow to emerge and establish in cold or dry soil conditions .
slow emerging se@@ ed@@ lings are most at risk from p@@ est and disease attack .
the aim should always be to encourage rapid and uniform emergence , and is best achieved when soil temperatures are moving upward from a base of 5 ° C , with adequate se@@ ed@@ bed moisture .
encouraging rapid emergence should always be the first defence against soil p@@ est and disease damage to young plants .

symptoms The first symptoms of black@@ leg on be@@ et se@@ ed@@ lings are irregular brown spots on the hypo@@ co@@ ty@@ l and root .
these le@@ sions enlarge , resulting in brown , sh@@ riv@@ elled roots .
those less affected may continue to grow , but are stun@@ ted and produce poor yield of de@@ formed be@@ et .
Ph@@ oma bet@@ ae also attacks the aerial seed heads in be@@ et seed crops , entering the seed ball as the crop mat@@ ures , subsequently attacking ger@@ min@@ ating seeds .
Ph@@ oma bet@@ ae attacks roots and can be an important source of storage rot on roots .
Ph@@ oma bet@@ ae over@@ w@@ inters on plant debris , mother be@@ et and on seed .
the py@@ c@@ ni@@ dia formed release spo@@ res in wet weather that are spread by rain spl@@ ash and insects .
spread within seed crops may also be systemic .
black leg can cause widespread losses if not controlled .
fun@@ g@@ icide seed treatments are able to control the problem , and with well treated seed severe crop loss is not normally seen .
A. co@@ ch@@ li@@ o@@ ides can be a severe problem in crops s@@ own late into warm mo@@ ist soils with high in@@ oc@@ ul@@ um levels .
Ph@@ oma bet@@ ae is probably the most important of the black@@ leg pathogens .
the leaf spot phase of the disease is of little economic importance except as a source of in@@ oc@@ ul@@ um in the growing seed crop and roots .
the first symptoms of the disease are Pin@@ head grey spots with red @@@ -@@ @ brown margins dev@@ el ­ oping into circular le@@ sions 35 mm in diameter .
under conditions of high humidity and temperatures , grey @@@ -@@ @ black con@@ idi@@ opho@@ res develop within the le@@ sions , and the le@@ sions spread rapidly over the surface of leaves , leading to leaf death .
disease cycle The main source of infection is plant debris that has over @@@ -@@ @ w@@ inter@@ ed , old storage sites , poorly harvested fields and seed crops . seed itself may also carry the path@@ ogen .
the con@@ i@@ dia ger@@ min@@ ate best at high relative humidity ( 90 % ) and at relatively high temperatures ( + 27 ° C ) .
they are dispersed by rain spl@@ ash or to a lesser extent , wind .
crops severely affected can suffer complete leaf death , leaving a black scor@@ ched appear ­ ance to fields .
plants react by producing a fresh growth of leaves , and these in turn can be attacked by the path@@ ogen In severe inf@@ est@@ ation years .
this reg@@ row@@ th can cause ser@@ i ­ O@@ Us loss of root weight and sugar content .
Northern regions of the NIS are less likely to be affected .
without control the disease can severely affect sugar production , and brings into ques ­ tion the economics of growing sugar be@@ et .
control In recent years , control measures in the Kub@@ an have been to spray with ben@@ om@@ yl ( Fun@@ d@@ az@@ ol or Ben@@ late ) , an M@@ BC fun@@ g@@ icide , or copper oxy@@ chloride ( Cu@@ pro@@ san ) , either alone or in a mixture with each other .
the effectiveness of ben@@ om@@ yl has been questioned recently and a degree of path@@ ogen resistance has been noticed .
however , more active chemicals are available and have proved successful in southern Europe in controlling the disease .
Pro@@ pic@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( T@@ ilt from Ci@@ ba @@@ -@@ @ Ge@@ ig@@ y ) - a systemic cur@@ ative and Protec@@ tant con@@ az@@ ole fun@@ g@@ icide - has given effective control of the disease .
it will also control r@@ ust , Ram@@ ul@@ aria and other be@@ et leaf pathogens .
Di@@ f@@ en@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( S@@ core from Ci@@ ba @@@ -@@ @ Ge@@ ig@@ y ) - a di@@ phen@@ yl @@@ -@@ @ ether tri@@ az@@ ole is a Protec@@ tant and cur@@ ative fun@@ g@@ icide .
the results from crops treated in southern Europe and NIS have been very encouraging , giving excellent protection from attack , as well as containing disease present on leaves .
a tank mix of both T@@ ilt premium and S@@ core was used on the demonstration fields in Krasnodar in 1994 with success :

p@@ est and disease control
disease cycle The path@@ ogen is wind blown onto be@@ et crops from any contaminated dec@@ aying plant material , attacking sen@@ escent plant tissue .
significance Wh@@ ilst widespread in be@@ et growing areas of the NIS , it is generally an un@@ important dis ­ ease .
symptoms Symp@@ toms usually occur on the central heart leaves of sugar be@@ et plants .
leaves turn light green , distort and th@@ icken .
a purple @@@ -@@ @ brown down@@ y spor@@ ulating fun@@ gal growth then appears .
the fun@@ gal growth is usually confined to the under@@ side of leaves , but can , par ­ ticul@@ arly in wet conditions , be seen on both surfaces .
in severely affected plants , the c@@ en ­ tr@@ al growing point will die with reg@@ row@@ th appearing from side shoots .
the fun@@ gus develops more rapidly in cool , hum@@ id weather , being more of a problem in the northern be@@ et growing regions of NIS .
seed crops are particularly at risk from the path@@ ogen , and damage can be severe .
S@@ por@@ an@@ gia ger@@ min@@ ate at temperatures of 10 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ° C during periods of high humidity .
early attack can affect sugar content of roots .
up to 50 % loss of yield can be expected in badly affected crops .
it is a very important disease in seed crops , the main over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing source of the in@@ oc@@ u ­ L@@ um .
the disease can cause almost total seed failure , affecting both seed yield and qu@@ al ­ ity .
ster@@ ility of seed in affected crops is common .
casual organism : fun@@ gi E@@ ry@@ sip@@ he bet@@ ae
symptoms A pow@@ dery white growth develops on both leaf surfaces during the summer growing sea ­ son .
as the attack develops , leaf chlor@@ osis occurs , and , in the case of severe attack , leaves turn yellow and die .
the presence of pow@@ dery mil@@ de@@ w on leaves decreases photo ­ synthesis , speeding sen@@ escence with resul@@ tant reduction in yield .
Con@@ i@@ dia produced from the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um initiate infections during July .
infection is fav@@ oured by temperatures around 20 ° C and relative humidity of 80 % plus .
dry , warm weather then encourages the colon@@ isation of plants .
cooler , wet@@ ter weather slows down the colon@@ isation , and epidemics are only usually seen in warm dry periods .
significance pow@@ dery mil@@ de@@ w can cause considerable damage to be@@ et crops .
in the southern region of NIS cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a will probably mask any potential damage from pow@@ dery mil@@ de@@ w .
Pro@@ pic@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( T@@ ilt from Ci@@ ba Ge@@ ig@@ y ) Tri@@ ad@@ im@@ en@@ ol ( Bay@@ fi@@ dan from Bay@@ er ) Tri@@ ad@@ im@@ ent@@ on ( Bay@@ let@@ on from Bay@@ er )
these chemicals have all given very good control of pow@@ dery mil@@ de@@ w .
other con@@ az@@ ole fun@@ g@@ ic@@ ides from various manufacturers may be available and give good results .
the tank mix or proprietary product ( Ri@@ az 300 ) for cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a control will also control pow@@ dery mil@@ de@@ w .
symptoms The disease is usually seen on older leaves toward the end of the growing season .
small light brown @@@ -@@ @ grey spots with darker borders develop into larger le@@ sions and coal@@ es@@ ce , leading to large areas of nec@@ ro@@ tic tissue , and , in severe cases , dead leaves .
the early le@@ sions are bigger and more irregular in shape than those of cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a .
later , the le@@ sions have white spor@@ e bearing con@@ idi@@ opho@@ res emerging .
with cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a these would be black , so do not confuse the two diseases .
heavy attacks cause premature death of leaves with loss of yield .
severely affected plants have a with@@ ered brown appearance .
T Disease cycle The fun@@ gus over@@ w@@ inters mainly on debris , although it can be seed borne , with seed crops and ground keepers acting as over@@ winter hosts .
disease development is optimal at 90 % relative humidity with temperatures above 17 ° C.
p@@ est and disease control
in warmer regions , it can be more of a serious problem , but again , cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a will probably mask the disease .
seed crops are more at risk and loss ­ es of seed can be considerable , often over 20 % .
both give good control of Ram@@ ul@@ aria , as does R@@ la@@ z 300 .
the economics of Ram@@ ul@@ aria control alone in root crops is uncertain , unless spraying for other leaf disorders .
in seed crops , however , chemical control will prove both beneficial and economically worthwhile .
the disease is most obvious during late summer on leaves , although earlier infection may occur .
primary symptoms consist of small red @@@ -@@ @ orange pu@@ st@@ ules surrounded by chlor@@ otic hal@@ oes appearing on both surfaces of leaves .
severe attacks can give leaves an overall orange @@@ -@@ @ brown appearance and may result in leaf death .
disease cycle
fun@@ gus over@@ w@@ inters primarily on seed crops or ground keepers as brown spo@@ res ( tel@@ en@@ to spo@@ res ) .
a temperature range of 15 @@@ -@@ @ 22 ° C is optimum for r@@ ust development .
temperatures above 22 ° C in@@ hibit r@@ ust development .
both give good control of R@@ ust , as will other con@@ oz@@ ole fun@@ g@@ ic@@ ides if available .
the chem@@ i ­ cal control of cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a will also control r@@ ust ( see cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a control ) .
all the above fol@@ i@@ ar diseases can affect the be@@ et crop to a greater or lesser extent .
in areas where cer@@ cos@@ por@@ a control is not necessary , then control for other fol@@ i@@ ar diseases should be considered .
p@@ est and disease control
the disease is usually seen as patches in fields .
the affected plants show symptoms of wil@@ ting , with fol@@ i@@ age slowly becoming totally nec@@ ro@@ tic .
a brown rot develops on the roots , which may be par ­ ti@@ ally or completely destroyed .
disease cycle
the fun@@ gus survives in the soil as s@@ cl@@ ero@@ tia for long periods .
my@@ c@@ eli@@ um grows from the s@@ cl@@ ero@@ tia and attacks roots of the be@@ et plants .
the disease is fav@@ oured by poor soil str@@ u@@ c ­ ture and water@@ logging .
the s@@ cl@@ ero@@ tia lay dor@@ man@@ t for long periods , and the disease will re@@ appear and spread in each succeeding be@@ et crop , particularly if the rotation is too short .
badly affected fields can expect a dramatic loss of yield to un@@ economic levels .
most other fun@@ gal root diseases ( listed below ) are not considered a problem as long as the rotation is kept as wide as possible , with a minimum 4 year break , which is usually the case throughout the NIS .
root diseases
casual organism : be@@ et nec@@ ro@@ tic Yellow Ve@@ in Virus { B@@ NY@@ W ) .
first symptoms are usually fol@@ i@@ ar symptoms .
veins of infected plants first turn pale yellow , then brown .
leaves become elong@@ ated and erect .
in the field , it is not always easy to spot these symptoms , mist@@ aking them for numerous other checks to growth or nutrient disorders .
p@@ est and disease control
disease cycle The disease cycle of the virus is associated with that of its soil borne fun@@ gal vector Poly@@ my@@ x@@ a bet@@ ae .
excess moisture In soils helps the development of the fun@@ gus , and , as the fun@@ gus develops , it trans@@ mits the virus onto plant roots .
significance The disease has caused many problems in be@@ et growing areas of Europe and its effect on sugar yield can be very serious , often hal@@ ving expected yield .
the disease limits sugar be@@ et production in affected areas , and is the most important sugar be@@ et disease in areas where it occurs .
it is very long lived in the soil , in resting propag@@ ules of poly@@ my@@ x@@ a bet@@ ae for more than 15 years .
there are new resistant varieties being developed in western Europe , and although these are well advanced , it must be in the interest of NIS be@@ et production to keep the disease out of all regions .
BY@@ V and BM@@ V are spread by ap@@ hid v@@ ectors , and B@@ C@@ TV by leaf hop@@ pers . the ap@@ hid vector My@@ z@@ us pers@@ ic@@ ae will transmit both BY@@ V and BM@@ V .
the cold w@@ inters in most of the NIS do much to control vector numbers , and so the problem is not as severe as in mil@@ der regions of Europe .
the viruses can , however , cause considerable damage to crop yields , and farms should be aware of them .
following mild w@@ inters , ap@@ hid and leaf hop@@ per numbers can build up rapidly and spread the virus during feeding .
should vector numbers build up , they should be controlled with a suitable insectici@@ de .
attacks young se@@ ed@@ lings , eating small pits into the upper and lower surface of co@@ ty@@ le * d@@ ons , leaves and peti@@ ol@@ es .
as leaves expand , holes develop at these pit sites .
severe í attacks can lead to a lace @@@ -@@ @ like appearance of leaves , most damage being caused in cold , o dry , slow @@@ -@@ @ growing conditions .
if seed treatments prove ineffective , and numbers of we@@ evil are likely to Incre@@ ase to levels that will damage the crop , a spray based on a synthetic py@@ re@@ thro@@ ld could prove worth ­ while .

damage Is often severe , with the wi@@ re@@ worm eating through the tap root and stem of se@@ ed@@ lings between seed and soil level .
control Control is necessary if 5 lar@@ v@@ ae are found per square metre , prior to drilling .
G@@ ama H@@ CH , incorporated into the se@@ ed@@ bed prior to drilling , can give useful control , but needs careful incorporation .
this treatment will also offer some control against other soil borne se@@ ed@@ ling pests .
seed treatment with Fur@@ ad@@ en will give very limited control .
various products such as G@@ ama H@@ CH are available in Russia and rates vary , so check with suppliers .
gran@@ ular insectici@@ des containing Car@@ bo@@ fur@@ an , Ben@@ di@@ oc@@ ar@@ b or Car@@ bo@@ sul@@ fan all control wi@@ re@@ worm , when incorporated into the seed fur@@ row with the covering soil ; these insectici@@ des also control many other soil pests .

if wi@@ re@@ worms are a serious problem , then the use of a gran@@ ular insectici@@ de may prove worthwhile .
this attacks young se@@ ed@@ lings and can cause ret@@ ar@@ ded growth or in severe cases , plant death .
once se@@ ed@@ lings have grown to 6 true leave stage , further damage Is usually of no further economic significance .

if plants are under stress or weather conditions are favourable for cat@@ er@@ pillar activity , then it may be better to spray at a lower threshold of 15 % of plants affected .
plants can be completely stripped of green leaf , leaving just the peti@@ ol@@ es and veins , and plants become skel@@ et@@ on@@ ised and suffer considerable loss of yield .
control is by using a synthetic py@@ re@@ thro@@ id , such as amb@@ ush or Dec@@ is , which gives very good control when spra@@ yed at an early stage of inf@@ est@@ ation .
it is important to apply these insectici@@ des in high volumes of water to achieve thorough crop coverage .
the be@@ et leaf min@@ er can cause considerable damage to crops if inf@@ est@@ ations are high .
usually , the first generation causes the most damage , feeding on the younger , more v@@ ul ­ ner@@ able plants in May and June .
if the number of fresh un@@ hat@@ ched eggs plus living lar@@ v@@ ae equals the square of the number of true leaves , then damage is likely to diminish yield .
once plants are beyond the 8 true leaf stage , then affect on yield is less likely .
control is by spraying di@@ meth@@ o@@ ate ( from BAS@@ F ) or Pi@@ ri@@ mi@@ pho@@ s @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ yl ( Ac@@ tel@@ lic from IC@@ I ) when lar@@ v@@ ae first appear .
many other pests can attack sugar be@@ et crops , but usually these are loc@@ alised .
early action is as important in controlling pests as it is with all other management aspects of the sugar be@@ et crop .
the hot dry summer conditions that usually prevail In the Kub@@ an and southern regions of the NIS often cause serious drought problems in the be@@ et crops .
when the rate at which water is extracted from the soil by be@@ et plants and the At@@ mos ­ phere ( é@@ vap@@ o@@ tran@@ spir@@ ation ) exceeds the rate at which plants can absorb water from the soil , water stress occurs , resulting in wil@@ ting and slowing down of crop growth .
in the most extreme cases , leaf death follows .
the shortage of water in be@@ et leaf tissue restricts the entry of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , slow ­ ing the pho@@ tos@@ yn@@ thesis process and leading to a reduction of yield potential .
the earlier drought and water stress affect the be@@ et crop , the greater will be the yield penalty .
irrigation
irrigation , if properly managed , is a valuable tool in producing a predictable crop .
farms in the region with water of suitable quality and available equipment should seriously con ­ sider applying irrigation water to the be@@ et crop .
with a free market for sugar , farms have a greater incentive to maxim@@ ise sugar production .
every extra ton@@ ne of sugar sold is worth in excess of 300 US $ per hectare ( 1994 prices ) .
if farms can apply enough water to satisfy the demand of the be@@ et crop for the whole season , the financial rewards can be substantial .
in Europe , the response to Ir@@ ri@@ gation over the last 10 years has averaged 1.5 @@@ -@@ @ 2.0 tonnes of extra sugar per hectare .
in the Kub@@ an , farms with irrigation can expect at least this level of improvement , or even higher .
whilst irrigation is a useful aid to crop establishment in dry springs , its major benefit is in the period from late June through to September .
from this information the irrigation requirement of the be@@ et field should be established .
it can tolerate levels of chloride in excess of 300 mg / l@@ t , and even up to 500 mg / l@@ t can be acceptable within certain application limits .
higher concentrations of chloride in water can be very damaging to plant tissue ( scor@@ ch ) and in@@ hibit root activity , so water quality should be known in advance .
night time appl@@ i ­ c@@ ations also make the maximum use of water applied , with less evap@@ oration from soil and leaf occur@@ ing at night .
the above rates assume that no more than 30 mm is applied per application .
if water quality falls within the above parameters , then irrigation can considerably increase sugar production and farm revenue .
investment in irrigation equipment may not be justified for the be@@ et crop alone , but , if it exists already , then its use on the be@@ et crop will be well worthwhile .
sugar be@@ et se@@ ed@@ lings are very vulnerable and liable to wind damage , particularly on light soils subject to wind erosion .
young se@@ ed@@ lings can be damaged by blown soil particles , becoming bru@@ ised and torn by the sand b@@ lasting effect .
damaged leaves wi@@ ther and die and , if the growing point is damaged , plant death will occur .
plants being buried by soil can also lead to ret@@ ar@@ ded , stun@@ ted growth or plant death .
very few farms in the Kub@@ an seem to take measures to prevent wind erosion damage , and with those that do , it is often ineffective .
as be@@ et crop establishment becomes more expensive , farms can no longer tolerate losses from wind .
the be@@ et is then dr@@ illed between the Emer@@ g ­ ing rows of the ' nurse ' crop .
a seed rate of 40 kg of barley per hectare is sufficient .
the seed bed prepared for the nurse crop will also be the seed bed for the be@@ et crop , so the same amount of care should be taken .
weed control , using the overall techniques as described earlier ( see weed control section ) , can be carried out in the normal way for broad @@@ -@@ @ leav@@ ed we@@ eds .
several methods of wind damage precautions have been widely used in the UK over many years .
the use of a ' nurse ' crop of barley has proved the most successful , and could easily be adapted for the Kub@@ an .
be@@ et usually continues to grow until the first frost stops growth , growth becoming pro ­ gres@@ sively slower until sugar content reaches Its maximum in October ( see Figure 5 ) .
figure 5 : effect of harvest date on yield , based on a 44 tonnes per hectare crop .
September
harvesting the be@@ et crop too early can sacrifice yield of both roots and sugar .
this increase in sugar yield often follows reg@@ row@@ th of the be@@ et , caused by C@@ erc@@ os@@ por@@ a or wil@@ ting damage .
when be@@ et reg@@ rows following loss of leaf , it dil@@ utes the sugar stored in roots .
once the plant has generated enough new leaf area , sunlight can be intercep@@ ted and converted into energy ( sugar ) within the plant , rebuilding the sugar content of roots .
if by harvesting early , this process is interrupted , then the loss of sugar yield can be very significant .
farms with adequate harvesting capacity can delay harvesting , and still clear the fields before the advent of bad weather .
the rate of surface to underground harvest losses varies considerably , depending on soil conditions and har@@ vest@@ er efficiency .
on average in the Kub@@ an and Ukraine , based on observation , more than one third of all losses occur above ground .
3 kg of losses per 20 metres of row equ@@ ates to + 3 tonnes per hectare .
the above problems can be eliminated with careful adjustment and operator training .
under @@@ -@@ @ top@@ ping leaves excess of crown and green material on the be@@ et , causing problems in storage and processing at the factories .
the aim should always be to leave as little sal@@ eable be@@ et in the field as possible , and to always ensure that no green material is sent to the factory .
always ensure that no green material is sent to the factory .
fl@@ ail height should be checked regularly in the field , and adjustment made both for height of operation and forward speed .
fl@@ ail top@@ pers travelling too fast are often a major cause of be@@ et being knocked out of rows , making it impossible for har@@ vest@@ ers to pick them up .
rubber fl@@ ail clean@@ ers are also used on be@@ et crops in NIS , following the fl@@ ail top@@ per to sweep clear all debris before the har@@ vest@@ ers .
these can do a good job in clearing debris , but equally they must be set correctly , or they can remove be@@ et from rows .
in clean crops of be@@ et , free of we@@ eds , the use of these cleaning machines is not necessary , and should not just be used because It is tradition .
farms should look closely at each operation and decide whether or not it is necessary .
kni@@ ves should be replaced frequently , and sharpen@@ ed .
a sharp cutting edge of 15 ° angle is recommended to give a clean cut .
the fe@@ eler arm and spring tension needs to be adjusted to suit local conditions .
these conditions vary from day to day , and often during the working day .
adequate supervision must ensure adjustments are made as soon and as often as necessary .
machine design in NIS does not always facilitate easy in @@@ -@@ @ field adjustments .
therefore , there is a tendency for operators to delay making adjustments for as long as possible .
supervision is needed to ensure these adjustments are made both in time and accurately .
it has been observed that on some farms top@@ ping machines are set at the beginning of the season and left at these settings for the rest of the season .
the resul@@ tant field losses on these farms was very high .
be@@ et top@@ ing machine , followed by fl@@ ail cleaner , 1994 harvest Kub@@ ni@@ iti@@ m .
the harvesting machines have been developed to work in local conditions , and cope well with hard soil conditions .
the harvesting of clo@@ ds along with be@@ et is usually a previous problem of se@@ ed@@ bed preparation , not a har@@ vest@@ er problem .
but , when adjusted correctly and working at correct angles , they lift be@@ et efficiently with the minimum of break@@ ages .
under wet harvesting conditions , the domestic machines do lack cleaning capacity , and the web type cleaner can prove inefficient .
however , in the Kub@@ an , wet harvesting con@@ di ­ tions do not occur regularly , and less than one year in ten can be considered a real pro@@ b ­ lem year .
the squeeze type shares tend to lift too much soil in wet weather , being better suited to dry soil conditions .
all too often NIS farms cra@@ ve for new European har@@ vest@@ ers , when what is really needed Is more care and attention taken with existing equipment .
any available capital would be far better spent on crop In@@ puts to raise production , and spare parts to get existing equipment back to work .
care and attention to detail will do much to alleviate these losses , motivation and training of staff being important elements of a be@@ et growing strategy .
under current arrangements with factories , the delivery of be@@ et to factories is direct from the field or from short@@ term holding areas .
the holding areas should be flat , level areas , free of debris .
a site lev@@ elled with a grad@@ er or bull@@ doz@@ er is essential .
the cleaner web@@ s should be in good condition , no missing or bent bars allowing be@@ et to drop through or get broken .
the machines need careful operators to load whole und@@ am ­ aged be@@ et , but with care they can achieve this , and the author observed them working satis@@ factor@@ ily on several farms .
when be@@ et Is harvested and placed in clam@@ ps , it starts to deteriorate almost at once .
the aim should always be to slow down this deterioration to within acceptable levels .
losses after harvest should not exceed 1 % of total value of the be@@ et crop .
at present , farms have little or no incentive to store be@@ et on farms .
however , any be@@ et stored , even on a temporary basis , will lose both root weight and sugar content if not treated with care .
if be@@ et is stored above 10 C , respir@@ ation sugar loss increases rapidly ; storage in high temperatures should be short term .
it is better to leave the crop in the ground for later harvest than risk high sugar losses in storage .
most farms who store temporarily do so In long , narrow clam@@ ps which is ideal in warmer weather , allowing for maximum ventilation .
some protection from the sun should be given , loose straw being satisfactory for this .
this would allow more time to establish a crop in the spring , and avoid the rush to clear the be@@ et crop in late August and September .
ideally , farms should only harvest enough be@@ et during this early period to keep factories running .
factories should reconsider the need to start operations so early , when be@@ et is still increasing its sugar yield .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
in its first four years of operation , 1991 -@@ 1994 , T@@ ac@@ is has committed EC@@ U 1,@@ 7@@ 57 million to launch more than 2,000 projects .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which al ­ lows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and fe@@ as@@ ability studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the content of this document is one such ac ­ tion .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
situations can be similar , but are seldom identical .
this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the project described here@@ after .
it was a successful operation that led to the creation of more than 120 private bak@@ eries in the region .
this brochure explains the various steps In setting up a private bakery , and is structured as a business plan .
please complete the questionnaire at the end of the document and return it to a T@@ DP distributor .
in a market economy , production is demand @@@ -@@ @ driven , i.e. driven by the consumer , or ¡ n other words : " you have to produce what the consumer asks for ! . "
" most of the recommendations were actually implemented after project completion .
the project was short ( six months ) and the consultant had to be efficient to perform the task in time .
fortunately , the Russian partner was determined to go through with the pro ­ ject and this proved to be one of the major reasons for success .
the City administration also played a key role in facilitating a number of things in the course of the project .
the Russian partner was Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom , the regional industrial bakery .
this industrial bakery , through its dynamic manager , supported the set up of the pilot private bakery from the very beginning .
it participated in the design of the shop , supported the con@@ su ­ mer survey and became a shareholder in the pilot bakery .
their motivation was guided by the perspective they had of a necessary change or Ad@@ AP ­ tation to the new economic environment and the developing market economy .
instead of fighting against the idea , they decided to be part of it as they clearly saw the opportunity to develop a sound business .
all the stages of the creation of the bakery were discussed in detail and deadlines were set .
this detailed preparation is another reason for the success of the project , and par@@ tic ­ ularly for the short time lap@@ se between design and completion .
it will save time and costly errors .
before getting the actual project work underway , it is necessary to have answered a lot of questions , such as : what products ? what organis@@ a ­ tion ? what prices ?
this is why this brochure is structured as a business plan .
before proceeding to the next stage , answers must be found .
and competition is developing to the benefit of the consumer .

since 1992 , many sector surveys have been carried out by T@@ ac@@ is projects .
if you are in a region where a T@@ ac@@ is project was implemented , ask around to know if it covered the sector that is of interest to you .
they are not easy to implement , and entrepreneurs generally do not carry them out themselves .
► In the case of Tomsk , the sector analysis had been carried out during the first phase of the T@@ ac@@ is project as this was one of the tasks assigned to the contractor .
the major findings are summar@@ ised in Figure 2 .
traditionally , bread was produced by Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom , the regional industrial bakery .
figure 2 : major findings of the sector analysis
demand
• bread is a basic product of the diet • loss of purchasing power resulting in a decrease in demand • demand sensitive to prices • but customers would accept to pay a quality premium
production
approximately 80 % of the main raw material , flour , was supplied by the regional State @@@ -@@ @ owned flour mill .
problems relating to terms of payment and inflation made the raw material supply sit ­ uation worse .
this feature had to be taken into account as a small bakery would face these problems more acutely owing to its size .
bread could be purchased in over 250 shops in the city of Tomsk , which is a relative ­ ly low figure when compared to shop density prevailing In western Europe .
as far as demand for bread is concerned , It is a basic product in the diet of Tomsk in ­ habit@@ ants .
this resulted in lower demand : daily production was 120 tons in 1989 but only 85 tons in 1992 .
the industrial bakery was only working at 70 % of its capacity .
in a competitive en@@ vir@@ on ­ ment , a shop attracts customers if it can fulfil their needs better than the competitors .
therefore , it Is essential to know customers ' needs .
► In Aut@@ umn 1992 , the situation was difficult for most people : high inflation , low wages , and deteriorating purchasing power .
the average salary was approximately 15 000 Rou@@ bles per month .
on the one hand , Tomsk was a fairly homogeneous city in terms of population , con ­ su@@ mption pattern and ( declining ) purchasing power .
on the other , It was clear that the prices of the new bakery products would be higher that the prevailing prices , because of the cost of imported equipment and additional ingredients in the products .
the project was too short to carry out a standard customer needs survey .
it was de ­ ci@@ ded to shor@@ ten the process , considering some pre @@@ -@@ @ defined ideas that the project team had about customer expectations .
the team was convinced that variety and new products would be an attractive feature of the bakery .
• In the course of the project , two German b@@ akers baked different sorts of bread twice a week in one of the Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom plants .
• A marketing action was organised in September 1992 , in the City centre .
visitors were offered five different types of bread .
they were then asked to make some comments on the quality of the product they t@@ asted .
the event was a big success : over 500 custom ­ ers attended and 65 people were interviewed .
then some identification comments were added to the answers ( gender , age , f@@ am ­ ily size ) .
a German b@@ aker at work .
a small bakery is both a producer and a retailer .
therefore , it has to face two kinds of competitors : the traditional bread producers ( the industrial bak@@ eries ) and the retailers .
before setting up the business , it is essential to know the competitors , their strengths and weaknesses .
for retailers , the criteria are the following • quality of the service • fresh@@ ness of the product • regularity of offer • prices • hygiene of the shop .
► As a matter of fact , the analysis was quite straightforward in Tomsk .
the only competitor for bread production was the industrial bakery .
• The industrial bakery was not working at full capacity .
this meant that the private bakery would address a demand already being met by the Industrial bakery , at least for traditional products . • The industrial bakery was not in a position to rapidly improve the fresh@@ ness of its products .
critical success factors
once all the analyses have been carried out , one should have enough Information to an ­ sw@@ er the question : " is there a real chance for my ' business I@@ dea ' ? . "
the answer will sel ­ dom be straightforward .
risk Is one of the key elements of a market economy .
one of the goals of any business is to sell Its products .
in a market economy , producers have to struggle to sell their products better than the competitor .
how to sell products ?
the answer to this question lies in marketing strategy .
► The findings for the Tomsk bakery are detailed below .
raw materials Gi@@ ven the key success factors defined for the Tomsk bakery ( quality and regularity ) , securing the raw material supply was of particular strategic importance .
furthermore , at that time , there was no prospect of short @@@ -@@ @ term improvement on this issue : terms of payment were becoming more and more complex , and even State organisations ex@@ -
marketing has its own j@@ arg@@ on .
the sector analysis provided information on this issue .
technology It very quickly became obvious that standard Russian ov@@ ens were limited in terms of the variety of products they could b@@ ake .
this is a problem as some products need to be baked at a very hot temperature during the first minutes and at a lower one afterwards .
the locally available kne@@ ading machines were also not satisfactory .
this is of para ­ mount importance as a well ­ kne@@ aded d@@ ough will guarantee a good product .
Tomsk was ideally equipped with a training institute for b@@ akers .
moreover , it was planned to have German master b@@ akers carry out a training programme in Tomsk , within the framework of the T@@ ac@@ is project .
more than 30 local b@@ akers were trained , with good results .
therefore , locally available baking technical skills were not seen as a problem .
more concern existed for skills in fields such as management , sales and marketing .
the market economy was just starting to develop and western style management and marketing were almost unknown .
this was a major concern as the project would not have time to thoroughly train staff in these fields .
a significant risk was associated with this deficiency In management and marketing skills .
as mentioned earlier , in order to have information on customer needs and prefer@@ en@@ c ­ es , taste tests were organised and customers questioned for their comments .

selecting the location of a retail shop Is of the utmost importance as It conditions the kind of customer .
if the shop Is located In a residential area , potential customers are at walk ­ ing distance from the shop and will be easier to attract .
if the shop is located in a less densely populated area , customers will have to rely on public transportation or their own vehicles to visit the shop .
the project was a very short one and , to save time , the City administration was asked to provide a building .
the City administration was only given a few indications : the team wanted to set up the shop in a residential area , and , If possible , not next to a competitor .
in a competitive environment , promotion has to be a constant concern .
any business needs to be promoted .
most customers are keen on novelty , and , If they are not " captive " because of lack of competition , they may easily change their purch@@ as ­ ing habits .
► The start @@@ -@@ @ up promotion strategy was a built @@@ -@@ @ in component of the Tomsk project , through the marketing training programme .
in addition to this , the team was in charge of getting the media interested In the ex ­ per@@ iment throughout the project .
trainers and train@@ ees .
the contractor insisted that the bakery 's management should not rely on the first months apparent success ( if this occurred ) .
success might result , for a significant part , merely from the novelty factor .
however , effect of novelty does not last long un ­ less management boosts it through regular promotion actions .
given the economic situation at the time , It was obvious that customers would be strongly responsive to prices .
some expensive shops were opened at that time in the large cities , targeting a tiny share of the population wealthy enough to pay huge prices for sophisticated goods ( generally Im@@ ported ) .
► This was not the intention of the T@@ ac@@ is project .
therefore , the target was clearly the just @@@ -@@ @ above average Tomsk household on a regular basis , with average households as casual customers .
but the prices had yet to ensure enough profit to allow self @@@ -@@ @ financed development of the business .
this was possible only if production costs were under tight control .
the operation of the shop would have to be very efficient ( limited waste , motivation of the staff ) to make it possible .
the margin depends on the product : it was decided to have a limited margin for bread , certainly the product for which competition would be tough@@ est , and a higher margin for other products .
for the price of the products , It was decided to have a margin over cost approach .
production and operation
at this stage , one should have a clear I@@ dea of the products to be offered and of the customers ' profile .
it is now time to define the production output and the means required to achieve It .
production output
before making any decision on the equipment to be purchased and the building to be purchased or rented , It is necessary to plan the output .
products have been defined , but quantities remain to be defined .
the decision concerning the output results from • the product @@@ -@@ @ mix • the baking time for each product • the capacity of the oven ( s ) that can be afforded with the available budget .
► The production plan that was designed for the Tomsk bakery is given in Table 2 .
table 2 : workload of the oven
local infrastructure requirements
local infrastructure requirements : these are all the facilities needed to manufacture the products and to ensure easy access to the shop . the most important are the following :
• • • access to the area ( public transport ) water and power supply , sewage telecommunications .
► In the Tomsk case , all the facilities were available in the area where the shop was to be created .
the equipment One has to consider the equipment to be used before making a decision on the building to be built , purchased or rented .
building requirements In terms of size and layout will depend on the kind of equipment to be purchased .
► There was the need for a multi @@@ -@@ @ use oven , I.@@ e. an oven in which almost any kind of bread and p@@ atis@@ seri@@ e could be baked .
the size of the oven was defined according to the budget constraint of the T@@ ac@@ is project and the financial involvement of the future shareholders of the bakery .
the list of equipment purchased Is given in the Table 3 .
table 3 : characteristics of the equipment ( A@@ moun@@ ts in roubles - November 1992 ) n d
the steps in setting up the bakery
once the technical characteristics of the equipment have been defined , one has to de ­ cide where to buy it .
in western Europe , even for minor investments , it is common to pro ­ c@@ eed with consultation of various manufacturers , so as to compare prices .
a valid proposal should include • technical characteristics of the equipment • price • transportation costs , if any • guarantee • date of delivery • terms of payment .
the oven purchased in Germany . Δ
► D@@ esp@@ ite investigations , it appeared that the required type of oven was not locally available .
with the exception of the oven and spare parts , all the equipment was second hand .
as a mat ­ ter of fact , given the limited financial resources available , it was not possible to buy new equipment .
nevertheless , this was not considered a problem .
there ¡ s a good second hand equipment market in some European Union countries , and excellent equipment can be purchased .
the equipment was purchased by representatives of the contractor in Europe .
fortunately , the shipment crossed the border without any problem . the equipment arrived in Tomsk in time .

as a matter of fact , numerous projects have invested in equipment manufactured in the NIS .
► The building made available by the City administration was quite convenient .
it actually consists of half of a large building , the other half being used as a fruit and vegetable store .
this was a positive feature for the bakery .

although the building had been recently built ( in 1989 ) , some repairs and adjustments had to be made .
while repairs were being carried out and the equipment and furniture were being in ­ stalled , particular attention was given to some basic aspects .
• Shop presentation had to attract customers and show them that everything was done to make them feel welcome :

they feel that nothing is hidden from them and are confident that the products are of good quality .
- windows that make it possible for pass@@ ers @@@ -@@ @ by to see what is In@@ side the shop .
this is important .
in most cases , the traditional Russian shop C@@ AN@@ NOT be seen from outside : plain double doors , windows painted with signs that prevent the pedestrian from clearly seeing what is inside .
it Is difficult to attract new customers .
- tables were installed in the shop for customers .
- the b@@ ake@@ house had to be organised so as to ensure a comfortable work space for the staff .
it is unfair to expect high motivation from the staff if no effort is made to ensure good working conditions .
to limit break @@@ -@@ @ ins , the building was equipped with Iron doors , p@@ ad@@ locks and an alarm system .

in the shop , the customers can see the b@@ akers at work .
these are all the resources that are used to achieve the output .
some of them are pro ­ por@@ tional to the level of activities of the budget and others are fixed , i.e. do not depend on the level of activity .
it is important to draw up a list for each category as this classification will be used for important calculations ( see " Finance " chapter ) .
some examples are given in Figure 6 .

for a bakery : flour , sugar , butter , mar@@ gar@@ ine , ...
indirect costs or fixed costs
although efforts can be made to identify the fixed and variable parts , it is best is to consider them as fixed costs , particularly when they are not high costs .
in the financial calculations , they correspond to the direct costs .
equipment spare parts may be considered as proportional factors as their wearing @@@ -@@ @ out depends on the level of activity .
nevertheless , for simplification purposes , they can be considered as fixed factors .
non @@@ -@@ @ proportional or fixed factors These are : salaries , rent , insurance , utilities , depreciation .
it Is particularly Import@@ ant to correctly plan the staff that will be needed to ensure efficient operation of the business .
staff has a cost , and it should be as limited as possible .
fur ­ ther@@ more , the more people work in a business , the more organisational problems there will be .
when a business is small , it is of the utmost importance to cater for the versati@@ lity of the staff : too specialised functions will lead to over @@@ -@@ @ staff@@ ing .
► For the Tomsk bakery , total planned staff amounted to 25 people .
they were classified as : management staff , b@@ akers , sales@@ men and other ( in charge of anc@@ illary services ) .
- accoun@@ tancy
- purchase of raw materials
- purchase of goods in hard currency
- equipment maintenance

all the staff members were selected following interviews .
the b@@ akers selected were mostly young people who had recently graduated from the Tomsk b@@ aker @@@ -@@ @ training institute .
opening hours The opening hours of a bakery depend on the area it Is located in .
in the case of a bakery located in a residential area , one might expect a regular flow of customers throughout the day .
► Pot@@ ential customers were asked the time at which they were more likely to go to the bakery : the answer was broadly 50 % in the morning and 50 % in the afternoon .
production
the production plan must be detailed , specifying the time the products should be avail ­ able for sale .
given that one of the critical success factors of any bakery Is the fresh@@ ness of the product , it is important to have a constant flow of fresh products .
working hours for the b@@ akers were set at from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. while working hours for the sales@@ men correspond to the shop opening hours .
► The following system was adopted • the customer orders the product from the shop assistant • the shop assistant prepares the products ordered by the customer , while • the customer pays to the cas@@ hi@@ er .
therefore all the sales can be registered at one level : the cas@@ hi@@ er .
to avoid having too many people In the shop at the beginning , two guards were posted at the door to regulate the flow of customers .
it was decided that not more than 20 customers should be In the shop at any one time .
un@@ sold products To be competitive , every detail must be cat@@ ered for .
competition ero@@ des the margin , and the only way to survive is to be efficient in every sector of the business .
production plan ­ ning has to adjust production to the sales .
the un@@ sold rate should not exceed 6 or 7 % of the daily turnover .
if the rate is above this level , this indicates faulty production planning .
► This is why special care was given to the Issu@@ e of hygiene .
management
now that the production system and the investments have been defined , the question of the legal status of the business has to be addressed .
► In 1992 , the choice of legal status was rather limited .
the pilot bakery was created as a limited partnership .
it was the very first private bakery of this type in Tomsk .
► Seven shareholders joined in the creation of the bakery : four individuals , all members of the staff that would operate the bakery , and three organisations .
their respective shares were as given in Table 5 .
shares roubles
four individuals ( all of them working in the bakery ) the commercial director
three firms Tomsk industrial bakery ( Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom )
► For Individu@@ als , the amounts mentioned above are high .
not many people are wealthy enough to pay such an amount of money .
• Sha@@ res were paid for by individuals according to a mixed scheme . - Half their share was said to correspond to five @@@ -@@ @ year operation earnings for each shareholder .
even if the business is small , attention must be paid to the organisation of the staff to be sure that the fields of finance , production and marketing are well covered .
and this is particularly important when new technical or managerial methods are to be used .
► Sever@@ al training sessions and seminars were organised during the project to better prepare the staff for their jobs .
because of the very short project duration , it was not possible to organise as many training sessions as required .
priority was given to production and service to custom ­ ers as these were critical success factors .
finance
before making the final decision to go ahead with the creation of the business , one should make calculations to see if It is financially viable .
broadly , the answer to the first question Is given by the profit and loss account , and the second by the c@@ ash@@ flow forecast .
there is no automatic relationship between the profitability of a business and its ability to generate cash to pay for its expenses .
this is why a c@@ ash@@ flow forecast is important for a business .
therefore the c@@ ash@@ flow situation has to be anticipated .
generally , the c@@ ash@@ flow forecast is broken down into monthly periods .
if the balance is negative , financial resources have to be found : this can be done by credit , or trying to get better terms of payment from the raw material suppliers .
there is another valuable analysis : the break@@ even analysis .
this analysis gives an ind@@ i ­ c@@ ation of the minimum activity level required to be profitable .
figure 7 : the break@@ even point
indirect costs
one can think of the break@@ even analysis as answering the following question : " how much do I have to sell to be profitable ? . "
each time a product is sold , part of the pro ­ ce@@ eds go to pay for the indirect costs of the business : this part , called the gross margin is equal to the selling price minus the direct costs .

► The detailed calculation is given In Table 7 .
indirect costs
whatever the level of activity , indirect costs are always incurred .
in other words , even If nothing is produced , indirect costs still have to be paid .
the rent agreement was signed for a duration of 10 years , according to a standard contract .
the rent was set at 900 Rou@@ bles per sq. m. until 3@@ 1st December 1993 .
this was a very reasonable price , but the City Administration was keen to support such an action and this was a way of proving Its commitment .

• depreciation For those who are not familiar with this term , depreciation is related to investments .
when a piece of equipment is purchased , it can be considered as a production cost throughout its life .
several depreciation calculation methods exist , but only one Is ac ­ cep@@ ted by the State .
in Russia for example , it is linear depreciation , i.e. the cost of the investment is divided by the number of years in the equipment 's life duration .
the State provides standards for life duration for all kinds of equipment .
• Staff So as to develop motivation and identification with the shop , it was decided that staff remuneration would comprise a fixed salary plus a bonus , the bonus being a function of turnover .
it was decided to start at relatively low levels so as not to jeopar@@ dise the starting business .
all agreed that there would be an observation period at the end of which the wages and bonuses could be revised , taking into account the results of the bakery .
it was decided that wages would be regularly reviewed so as to cater for inflation ,
details on the remuneration of the staff are given in Table 8 .
the only advantage granted to the staff was purchasing bread at 80 % of its retail price .
although advantages in kind are handy , they have serious drawbacks : they are not clearly cal ­ cul@@ ated and quickly become " hidden " costs .
indirect costs are detailed in Table 9 .

► In 1992 , bank credits were almost Im@@ possible to get , and It was even more difficult to get a loan In order to set up a business .
the financing scheme was in fact provided by the shareholders themselves and the
the profit and loss account presented in this document ( see Table 10 ) Is drawn up ac ­ cor@@ ding to western standards , but differences with the Russian system are only minor .

the steps in setting up the bakery
the calculated profit showed that the risk of the business was limited and that financial resources would be available for investment and future development of the business .
as far as the pur ­ chase of raw materials is concerned , given the arrangement with the mill , It does not af ­ f@@ ect the cash situation of the bakery .
this Is the reason why no detailed c@@ ash@@ flow forecast is presented .
of course , it is easier when there is only one product .
in the case of the bakery , there are several products .
therefore , the analysis is carried out using a margin average given the selling pattern and the margins for each product ; an average gross margin per 1 000 Rou@@ bles of turnover is calculated .
a provision for extra expenses was included .
this shows that the business was sound and risks limited .

the bakery was registered on 21st October 1992 . it was named " NI@@ K@@ ES . "
three years later
a visit was made to Tomsk in September 1995 .
NI@@ K@@ ES - What has changed since 1992
when the project was completed , the bakery was just a few weeks old .
although the creation had been thoroughly planned , it was obvious that changes would take place .
change in the management structure
in 1992 , It had been decided to rely on a team of four people for the management of the bakery .
although one person had been appointed General Manager , responsibilities were supposed to be shared and decision @@@ -@@ @ making to be collective .
this proved to be un@@ workable .
soon after the creation , conflicts occurred among the var ­ IO@@ Us directors .
during the first 6 months of operation , three of the four directors left the bakery .
although these problems did not have a noticeable impact on the bakery 's performance , the shareholders decided to revise the management structure .
a general manager was appointed in 1993 and Is still in place .
he is in charge of the business , and is assisted by two production supervisors and an accountant .
the general manager is now ultimately responsible for the performance of the bakery and Is the only person who deals with the shareholders .
this management structure has proved to be much more efficient than the original one .
change in the ownership structure
as a result of revision of the management structure , the ownership structure also changed .
because the four directors left before having completed 5 years with the bus@@ i ­ ness , they were not entitled to any share compensation when they left .
the change in the management was an opportunity to revise the ownership structure .
table 12 shows the current structure .
three years later

10.@@ 0 does not work in the bakery
10.@@ 0 does not work in the bakery
whilst at the time of the creation each director had 15 % of the shares , the general manager now has 30 % .
the foreign company decided to reduce its share to a symbolic participation , mainly because of the difficulties for the firm in being an active shareholder : Tomsk is quite far from western Europe .
of the original staff , only four sales@@ men are still working at Nik@@ es .
most of the changes took place In 1992 @@@ -@@ @ 1993 when the management problems had resulted in poor working conditions .
since 1993 , the staff has been stable .
most of the b@@ akers are young people who recently graduated from the Tomsk training institute .
none of the original b@@ akers is working in Nik@@ es at present .
production output
bakery output has fallen from 1.2 tonnes per day In 1992 to 1.0 ton@@ ne per day at present for the first term of 1995 .
some tests have been recently carried out : the general manager has made sales arrangements with several retailers who are keen to sell " Nik@@ es @@@ -@@ @ quality " bread and rolls .
the aim is to Incre@@ ase the output to its 1992 figure and to work at full capacity .
when sales slow down and profit is falling , there is a ref@@ lex to cut costs .
owing to the vigilance of the shareholders , the quality of the Nik@@ es bakery products has always remained beyond repro@@ ach .
the strategy of reducing the quality of the products so as to offer them at a price similar to those of competitors would hardly have been fruitful .
fixed costs at Nik@@ es , particularly because of the cost of the equipment , are too high to make their products compete with average quality bread .
furthermore , it would have been a no @@@ -@@ @ return strategy , as Ni@@ ke 's image would have been considerably damaged .
three years later
in Tomsk , despite the creation of 120 bak@@ eries , the Nik@@ es bakery remains the reference .
moreover , the Nik@@ es bakery has reliable clients .
as a matter of fact , the bakery closed for 3 months in 1994 : the roof of the building was not fully waterproof and had to be rebuilt .
just a few days after its re@@ opening , all the regular clients had returned to the bakery .
there are currently over 30 different products for sale , slightly less than in 1992 .
some of the 1992 products had to be ab@@ an ­ d@@ oned because of the ir@@ regularity in the supply of various key ingredients .
the Nik@@ es management has confirmed that product @@@ -@@ @ mix is of great importance in attracting clients .
prices
the Nik@@ es bakery is more expensive than most of the other bak@@ eries , although costs are under tight control and profit margin reduced .
this characteristic does not prevent clients from buying at Nik@@ es .
profit has been slightly falling since 1992 .
the first months were highly profitable , but , as competition developed , pressure was put on the prices and sales slowed down .
further ­ more , the bakery had to bear the financial burden of roof reconstruction , despite the fact that the building belongs to the Municipality .
Nik@@ es will be reimbur@@ sed through rent exemption over a certain period of time .
nevertheless , as a consequence , Nik@@ es has not been able to In ­ v@@ est as planned in the development of the business ( new equipment , installation of a café ) .
bread made by Nik@@ es .
despite a difficult 1 st quarter , the profit margin for the first six months of 1995 was al ­ most 10 % .
this is better than most of the other bak@@ eries In the Tomsk region .
summary
despite a difficult first year , the Nik@@ es bakery has proved to be a sound business .
the representatives of Russian partner organisations ( Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom and Tomsk mill ) proved to be one of the key reasons for success .
actively involved in the practical work for the construction of the bakery , they always did their best to solve problems and main ­ tain the pace of the project .
they played an active role as organisations but the role of their Individual representatives was nevertheless crucial .
they identified strongly with the business despite the fact that they were not involved in the operation on a d@@ ally basis .
this allowed them to maintain a long term view of the business and to make difficult decisions .
management structure
work organisation and responsibility @@@ -@@ @ sharing as planned by the project did not work .
it was somehow too ide@@ alistic in the local context .
the appointment of a general manager , fully responsible for the performance of the bakery became indispensable to guarantee good operation .
technical skills and charisma are not sufficient to ensure a good manager .
good work organisation and sound financial management are not sufficient to ensure the success of a business .
in a competitive environment , customers are volatile .
such behaviour , " listening to the customer , " is something quite new in the NIS .
so far , the managers who pay sufficient attention to this are too few and far between .
the project was too short to carry out an intensive training programme .
only a few marketing actions have been organised since the creation of the bakery .
the Incre@@ asing competition should have been an In@@ c@@ entive to develop a more aggressive marketing strategy .
three years later
the most dangerous policy would be to constantly modify the business image : this would merely confuse the customer .
there is therefore an effort to be made in adjusting to the environment while conserv@@ ing the business image .
this must be done through short term changes within a longer @@@ -@@ @ term strategy .
the lack of longer @@@ -@@ @ term strategy may be one of the most important problems currently facing NIS managers .
three years later
the bread sector in Tomsk
much has changed since 1992 as most of the sector operators are now private .
a frequent comment is that demand for bread has considerably diminished over the last three years .
this would be in line with what has happened in most of the NIS .
however , in the case of Tomsk region , this is not true .
the Tomsk mill that provides most of the flour to the region 's bak@@ eries is a privileged observer of the market .
the mill Manager 's assessment of the situation is straightforward : " the demand for flour - by bak@@ eries - has been stable for the last three years .. "
as a matter of fact , small bak@@ eries escape statistics .
the fall in demand observed by many bak@@ eries is in fact a loss of market share : the lost demand is being supplied by new bak@@ eries .
the mill now belongs to its workers ( over 700 shareholders ) and its legal status Is that of a joint stock company .
although bak@@ eries are free to buy flour from any supplier , the Tomsk mill is in a situation of natural monopoly , particularly for flour .
although there Is not yet true competition , it is evident that Tomsk mill Is prep@@ ar ­ ing for this .
Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom had a monopoly until 1993 but this is no longer the case .
• The industrial bak@@ eries that were part of Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom have become Independent and been transformed In@@ to joint stock companies . these bak@@ eries are now owned by their workers .
the management team has remained and a new , entirely State @@@ -@@ @ owned company , Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b , has been set up .
the newly privati@@ sed industrial bak@@ eries are currently facing a number of problems .
their output dropped sharply : some by 25 % , others by 40 % .
this is a consequence of the de ­ velop@@ ment of the small bak@@ eries and the resulting competition .
three years later
as far as pro ­ duction costs are concerned , because of economies of scale , they should be compet@@ i ­ tive , provided they are correctly managed .
some of the bak@@ eries have already started to Im@@ prove the quality of their bread ( they have abandoned some automated procedures in favour of manual ones ) and are expanding their product range .
Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b Is now a small enterprise .
since its privatisation , it has created three small bak@@ eries , comparable to Nik@@ es in terms of size .
al ­ though Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b has five retail outlets , the management sees in the physical separ@@ a ­ tion of production and sales a problem to better stick to customers expectations .
the small private bak@@ eries
since 1992 , approximately 120 small private bak@@ eries were created in the Tomsk region • 70 in the city of Tomsk • 50 in the rural area .
most of them are ru@@ dimentary bak@@ eries : they produce one or two kinds of bread .
three years later
although an overwhelming majority of the people met believe that the development of competition Is beneficial for the customer , some complain about the quality of the bread produced by some of these bak@@ eries .
to prevent further problems of this type , the regional administration is about to issue some basic In@@ struc@@ tions all bak@@ eries would have to comply with .
the development of the bak@@ eries has been so rapid that Tomsk is said to be already sat ­ ur@@ ated .
however , the administration is ready to make efforts to help the bak@@ eries , as it sees they are a real benefit to the customers .
• Ta@@ xes should be lowered : this will be beneficial to the well @@@ -@@ @ established bak@@ eries .
and a Tomsk bakery equipped with a European oven .
three years later
conclusion
however , it must be emphasi@@ sed that the creation of all the other bak@@ eries , over 120 , has been achieved without any kind of foreign assistance : everything has been ensured by local resources , skills and entrepreneurship .
the Tomsk transformation process Is now expanding to western Siberian regions , such as Kemerovo , Krasno@@ jar@@ sk , Novosibir@@ k or Bar@@ n@@ aul .
as before , the process is taking place without any outside assistance .
T@@ AD@@ S is proud to have participated in this achievement .
the aim of the T@@ ac@@ is project has been fulfilled , because a market economy has developed and western assistance is no longer required .
... and of course , on satisfied customers ( the queue when Nik@@ es opened in 1992 ) .

objectives
T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and fe@@ as@@ ability studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
situations can be similar , but are seldom identical .
this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by several projects .
various T@@ ac@@ is projects have worked / are working on the collective farm restructuring issue .
it draws on the findings and pilot @@@ -@@ @ actions of various T@@ ac@@ is projects that have worked on this difficult issue .
collective farm managers , training institutes
this privatisation had gen ­ erated many hopes and should have marked the beginnings of an improvement in agr@@ i ­ culture for the NIS countries .
however , now many people are disillu@@ sioned and talk of this privatisation as " merely changing the sign at the farm gate . "
this risk had been foreseen by the very first experts in the T@@ ac@@ is Food and Agriculture programme as early as 1992 .
privati@@ sing without re@@ organising is perhaps even more pre@@ judicial to the improvement of agricultural performances in these countries than a not changing at all would have been .
certain collective farms not possessing the skills to confront the difficult economic situ@@ a ­ tion can be lik@@ ened to drifting boats .
certain of them are destined to failure as ownership , especially when It is shared by numerous individuals , thus diluted , does not necessarily bring with it responsibility .
the predic@@ a ­ ments they face are of various types .
today , the following principle is generally accepted : restructuring must allow each ind@@ i ­ vi@@ dual to feel responsible for his work and benefit from the fruits of his labour .
this principle can only be respected if
these conditions considerably reduce the possible forms of restructuring .
certain farms set up re@@ organisation plans , which are not always per@@ tinent and often not far @@@ -@@ @ reaching enough as the environment seems to be hostile to a new organisation .
it is true that this problem is complex and that a miracle recipe does not exist .
before out@@ lining some principles for drawing up a restructuring plan , an idea that has a wide following must be mentioned .
as it has already been stated , certain collective farms have taken initiatives in an effort to improve their performances .
• difficulty in finding inputs at fair prices • lack of technology • downstream monopolies • lack of credit facilities .
this also encourages certain collective farms to integrate yet more activities ( production of animal feed@@ stuff , transformation of products ) .
it Is doubtful that such investments are profitable and there are several reasons for this .
• These are inevitably small semi @@@ -@@ @ industrial units and their performance is less than that of the large industrial ones .
it is unfortunate to see over@@ capacities being created in this way , while there is a scarcity of financial resources for re@@ launching agriculture .
finally , certain people believe that the performance of the collective farms can be improved by Intro@@ duc@@ ing management techniques .
but Its impact stands to be limited by the slugg@@ is@@ hness that is char@@ ac ­ ter@@ istic of a good number of collective farms .
if the desired end result seems more and more obvious , the way to achieve this has to be invented .
the means must be adapted to each particular case but must follow clear and well @@@ -@@ @ grounded principles .
simple criteria for the restructuring stages
in order to guarantee its success , it is important that each stage of the restructuring process answers four criteria
if a restructuring plan leads to in@@ discriminate pl@@ undering of resources , the plan is sure to end in failure .
unfortunately , very often the experiments in re@@ organisation and restructuring already car ­ R@@ ied out do not comply these criteria .
in order to be effective , a restructuring plan must hing@@ e on three series of actions or pro ­ c@@ ed@@ ures .
communication is one of the most important aspects In the restructuring process .
apathy , disillu@@ sion@@ ment and resignation are sometimes so ing@@ rained in the people on the farms that a great effort is needed to deliver the Information .
few members of the colle@@ c ­ tive farms will come of their own accord to seek this Information , not normally having had the opportunity of using such information to influence a decision .
prepare the institutional environment for the producers
this includes for example , the State administration and the banks which should give all possible support , particularly during the first experiments in restructuring .
_ B@@ AR _ especially to explain .
the apathy and re@@ tic@@ ence that surfaces when people are faced with restructuring is often due to a fear of losing in the process .
this exchange alone will enable the fears of the members of a collective farm to be understood as they are faced with restructuring .
restructuring is complex , as much for its reasons as for the procedures .

the questionnaire used in the survey must be short as difficulties ( in terms of time and the exac@@ tness of replies ) can be encountered in long questionnaires .
examining the results
what can be done must be done and this argument must be backed with the situation of the farm itself .
here again , the introduction can be used for formulating the messages .
first and foremost , restructuring must be presented as a process that depends on the initiative of the members of the collective farm .
the different stages and procedures are to be explained .
they must be given another way of expressing themselves .
prepare the producers ' environment
it is important to bear this fear in mind .
somehow ways must be found to make people feel secure while implementing restructuring .
some structures must remain or be created to play a securing role .
the traditional collective farm integrates part of the producer 's environment .

prepare the producers ' environment
the cooperative can include agricultural experts in its staff ( crop cultivation and animal hus@@ band@@ ry ) .
the cost of the cooperative 's advisory services are included in its general over@@ heads and , consequently , this does not appear as a paying service for the producer .
but It is important for a start not to create a complex structure involved in two many services .
the assets transferred to the cooperative
all the assets that are needed for its good functioning are transferred to the cooperative .
this Board of Directors ap@@ points a director for the cooperative . his tasks are the follow ­ ing ones
as far as the choice of the organisation 's legal status is concerned , chosen from among those allowed by the legislation , this differs from country to country .
a limited profit margin can be envisaged , even if this is only to constitute a reserve .
profits are used according to a decision by the General Meeting .
among the various po@@ s ­ si@@ bilities figure the following
a 1991 T@@ ac@@ is project assisted a group of private farmers in the Ri@@ az@@ an Oblast .
at the beginning , there were just five .
now , they are 13 and have created their own association , distinct from the district Ak@@ k@@ or association .
the T@@ ac@@ is project financed the purchase of equipment ( tractors , Pl@@ ough@@ s , harvesting equipment ) .
in 1994 , the director of a neighbouring collective farm showed enthusiasm at the prospect of creating a cooperative with the private farmers .
its members are the collective farm as a whole , and several private farmers as individuals .
because of the financial situation of the private farmers , some arrangement had to be found to allow them to become members .
a collective farm , in the Pr@@ on@@ sk district , was in a particularly dramatic situation .
with the support of the district administration , a cooperative was created to take over the facilities .
restructuring remains a selection process : selection of viable projects as well as people . certain will gain and others lose .
the creation of the cooperative is just a first step In the restructuring process . it creates the necessary conditions for deep ­ er restructuring .
however , thought must be given to the resources that each person can gather together by taking initiatives for bringing light to these shad@@ ow@@ y zones .
another characteristic of the market economy Is the element of risk . restructuring in@@ te ­ gr@@ ates this new element .
given the skills available at the collective farm level for adapting to the market economy , the risk is great .
to demand that these new structures " take them on " would only make the structures vulnerable .
risk stimulates performance and it is the absence of individual risk which pro ­ vo@@ kes the dem@@ o@@ tiv@@ ation and ir@@ responsibility .
this stage is an opportunity to revise the production systems in place at present .
the restructuring process must allow a real@@ location of resources towards those who will use them the best .
the existing situation , C@@ AN@@ NOT be ignored .
they must be given the where@@ with@@ al to constitute the group that they want , to develop the activity they wish to develop and therefore the means to explain and convince .
joining a group must be through choice and thus requires taking action .
however , it seems that It is not wise to exceed 15 PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E for any activity integrating animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
• projects concerning agricultural production • projects relating to the environment of agricultural production • other projects .
projects relating to the environment of the agricultural producer
the structure for the milk production would lose out in this situation .
this method will allow a good deal of time to be saved .
• total shares of assets and land to which the members of the group have the right@@ 131 • surface area of land they need to carry out the project well
the length of this stage will vary according to the nature of the projects and the people making up the group .
it serves no useful purpose to want to accelerate the process un@@ duly .
this would only make the new structures vulnerable and endanger the whole restructuring process .
nevertheless , deadlines should be set : an open @@@ -@@ @ ended process Is likely to never ... start .

collective farm managers are often making efforts to attract investors . in vain for most of them .
but they would not be interested in bearing the risk of a much bigger enterprise , involved in activities not familiar to the potential investor .

target Resid@@ ential energy consumer groups , electricity distribution companies audience and utilities .
resolving the issue of non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft represents the most urgent challenge to the stabil@@ isation of Armenia 's energy system .
the non @@@ -@@ @ payment situation is particularly acute in the residential sector .
electricity sup@@ - p pl@@ ies are erratic , non @@@ -@@ @ payment penalties are small and rarely enforced and residential consumers have largely lost confidence in the electricity companies .
technical losses are greatly increased and local electricity distribution systems are unreliable and often dangerous .
this system is based upon the assumption that ' consumers would be willing to pay their electricity bills if they were provided with a reliable and secure electricity supply ' .
the innovative aspect of the new system was the formation of an Electr@@ icity Consu@@ mption Organisation ( EC@@ O ) - a non @@@ -@@ @ profit body that purchases electricity collectively on behalf of a large group of individual consumers .
the concept and practic@@ ality of introducing such a system were thoroughly developed through an initial study and then demonstrated in two pilot projects in the city of Yerevan .
in both pilot projects residential non @@@ -@@ @ payment has been reduced to manageable and acceptable levels , and theft has been virtually eliminated .
the EC@@ O concept is currently being replicated with T@@ ac@@ is support in a further eight districts of Yerevan and is receiving a great deal of attention from other regions of Armenia .
the current energy situation in Armenia
Armenia has very limited domestic energy resources and is almost 95 % dependent on energy imports .
government budget shortages and poor enforcement of revenue collection have meant that essential renovation and maintenance of the energy system has largely been neglected .
this shift has dramatically increased electricity demand in the residential sector due to the very poor efficiency of electrical heating and cooking .
by contrast , energy demand in the industrial sector has fallen , primarily due to an overall drop in industrial activity .
the non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft problem
non @@@ -@@ @ payment levels of 80 @@@ -@@ @ 90 % are typical in the residential sector .
the economic transition has caused wages to become greatly devalu@@ ed and much of the population struggles to cover basic living expenses .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment for electricity is rarely pen@@ alised and , with the unreliable quality of the service provided , residential con ­ sum@@ ers have lost confidence in the utility and distribution companies .
given this situation it is not surprising that a very high proportion of bills remain unpaid and that illegal connections are commonplace .
the current energy situation in Armenia
typical electricity installation in a residential building .
overall electricity generation fell by two @@@ -@@ @ thirds from 1988 to 1995 .
the current energy situation in Armenia
the revenue received by the distribution sector during the first quarter of 1996 represent ed only 30 % of anticipated payments .
even taking into account the contribution of deb@@ te@@ qu@@ alisation through bar@@ tering , this still leaves a massive discre@@ pancy between the cost of supplying electricity and the revenue received back from consumers .
this creates a situation where distribution companies have critical c@@ ash@@ flow difficulties and are unable to fund even urgent maintenance of the system .
foregoing this basic maintenance can only lead to more major repairs becoming necessary in the near future .
figure 2 : flow diagram of losses in the distribution sector , first quarter 1996
total ECO@@ NO@@ M@@ IC LO@@ S@@ SE@@ S : 5 ( 35 % )
there is a major discre@@ pancy between utility company costs for supplying electricity and the revenue collected from consumers .
energy consumption in these sectors is largely accounted and known , yet not paid for .
in contrast , energy consumption in the residential sector is poorly account ed for and non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft are known to be high .
the residential sector therefore offers the largest and most rapid opportunity to begin to solve the energy non @@@ -@@ @ payment problem .
the Government recognised the magnitude of the non @@@ -@@ @ payment situation in the residential sector and in 1995 a number of actions to curb non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft were implemented by ministerial decree .
regulatory approaches to non @@@ -@@ @ payment have received only limited success - partly because they do little to improve the quality of service received by residential consumers .
revenue collection was greatly increased , but residents protested strongly .
some villages are now required to pay for their electricity in advance , in others payment of 50 % of bills results in an extra hour of electricity .
this incentive has not been very effective as individuals fail to appreciate the link between their actions and the service provided .
electricity ration@@ ing and low up@@ take levels meant that the activity met with limited and short @@@ -@@ @ lived success .
however these powers have not been widely exercised : lack of enforcement being due to the small penalties , lengthy judicial procedure , and the massive extent of theft amongst the population .
a key failing of these measures was that they did little to tackle the central issue of improving the quality of service to residential consumers .
an effective billing and payment system is needed to boost utility revenues and provide consumers with better energy services .
the cooperative billing system
assumption : the majority of residential consumers are willing to pay for a reliable and secure electricity supply .
the initial study assessed the current energy situation in Armenia .
these recommendations were enacted through two pilot projects in the Yerevan districts of Arab@@ k@@ ir and E@@ re@@ bun@@ i .
about 800 resid@@ ences were covered in the Arab@@ k@@ ir district and initially 400 In E@@ re@@ bun@@ i , although this grew rapidly over 10 months of operation to around 2500 connections .
since the energy crisis , electricity supply has been highly unreliable and individuals have become accustomed to a culture of non @@@ -@@ @ payment .
during the energy crisis the government was unable to enforce payment of electricity bills .
real incomes were collapsing , the economy was facing hyper @@@ -@@ @ inflation and individuals became accustomed to not having to pay for their erratic electricity services .
power was needed for heating and cooking , especially in winter , and non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft grew rapidly .
this high level of tam@@ pering with the system is possible due to an inability to enforce penal ­ ties and because of the faulty condition of the distribution network itself .
cab@@ ling within buildings is often in a highly dangerous condition through illegal connections and provisional repairs .
the result is that solutions to the non @@@ -@@ @ payment problem based upon individual connections are not enforc@@ eable and any practical solution must be implemented at the level of the sub@@ station .
this is clearly an unsustainable situation and a restructured , enforc@@ eable and more effective billing and collection system is urgently required .
the cooperative billing system
internal wiring is often in a dangerous condition .
the new billing and collection system
central meters in sub@@ stations
the EC@@ O is responsible for all payment collection within its region and for resolving instances of non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft .
should the EC@@ O not meet its payment obligations ( taking into account specific contractual issues ) , the distributor can cut off the electricity supply to the whole of the EC@@ O region .
in practice , only a small proportion of consumers have been found to be unwilling to pay and that has primarily been due to a genuine inability to afford payment .
new meters installed in a sub@@ station .
the Incre@@ ase in payments provides vital revenue to the EC@@ O to meet its contractual arrangement to the distributor .
a clear link between payment and quality of service motiv@@ ates consumers to pay their electricity bills .
legal status of the Electr@@ icity Consu@@ mption Organisation ( EC@@ O )
a regulatory change was needed to create the legal basis for a non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisation to represent electricity consumers .
a formal electricity supply contract specifies delivery rules , acceptable technical losses and terms of payment .
this demonstrated the Government 's firm commitment to solving the non @@@ -@@ @ payment problem and had a much wider application than the energy sector alone .
in particular , the agricultural sector has benefited from being able to form non @@@ -@@ @ profit co ­ operatives .
an EC@@ O can be set up by a private individual or by a group of residents and to have legal status it must be officially registered by the state .
typically an EC@@ O will have 35 sal@@ ari@@ ed staff depending on the number of resid@@ ences it covers .
in other cases the distribution company may choose to establish the EC@@ O with the involvement of residents .
the EC@@ O negoti@@ ates a supply contract with the distribution company and a model has been developed within the T@@ ac@@ is project .
this contract specifies delivery rules , accept able technical losses and terms of payment .
the cooperative billing system
to fulfil its responsibilities the EC@@ O has to provide an ' electricity passport ' - a detailed description of the technical layout of the electrical distribution system within the EC@@ O 's boundaries .
this task has been assisted by the development of a custom@@ ised system model by the Energy Research Institute of Armenia .
the passport becomes a formal part of the contract and serves to detail the EC@@ O 's precise responsi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es@@ . ities .
apartment building
the EC@@ O needs to demonstrate strong management and establish a firm payment discipline amongst residents .
the EC@@ O is responsible for all electricity met@@ ering within its boundaries , with central met@@ ering for larger buildings , communal entr@@ ances in apartment buildings or small groups of houses .
individual consu@@ mptions are checked regularly through readings in the apartments and houses .
consumption for communal services such as the lift , water pump and st@@ air and external lighting are ap@@ por@@ tioned evenly across consumers in the respective entr@@ ances or buildings .
this responsibility also extends to carrying out maintenance of the local low voltage network and consumers can arrange with the EC@@ O to undertake repairs to cab@@ ling or apartment meters .
shops and small factories are considered individually and have separate contracts with their EC@@ O .
in many cases tariffs for services such as water must be re @@@ -@@ @ negotiated .
in the pilot project entr@@ ances or groups of houses that continued to make illegal connections or refused to pay were cut off .
in most cases this led to a more serious appreciation of the need to pay bills and on a timely basis .
after a few months it became practical to begin to isolate individual defaul@@ ters , rather than pen@@ alise a group of consumers .
the cooperative billing system
the EC@@ Os recognised the genuine inability of some consumers to afford all or part of their bills .
an additional benefit is the generation of statistics on the real ability of the population to pay for essential services .
this provides accurate information to the Government as it structures future social security systems for the poorest groups .
current income statistics are scarce and of uncertain reliability .
collective purchasing enables the EC@@ O to negotiate a favourable electricity price and a more secure supply .
the cooperative billing system
• for maintenance - to ensure that necessary repairs and maintenance are managed locally and promptly carried out • salaries of EC@@ O staff and administration costs .
the non @@@ -@@ @ profit character of the EC@@ O means that expenditure is tightly controlled on the three components listed above and that all revenue is used for the direct benefit of its members .
renovation and maintenance of the distribution system
over the last five years or so , the electricity distribution system in Armenia has suffered extensive damage .
outside of crisis repairs to restore supply , lack of resources has meant that little maintenance or renovation has been possible .
basic rehabilitation work was needed to increase supply reliability and to convince residents of the EC@@ O 's ability to improve energy services on their behalf .
this included repair to damaged cables , electrical building panels and f@@ uses and installation of central electricity meters .
the work also served a highly important non technical purpose in raising the profile of the EC@@ O and convincing residents of its ability and commitment to make real improvements to energy services on their behalf .
through the project , T@@ AC@@ IS funded repairs of US $ 20,000 in the district of E@@ re@@ bun@@ i and a further US $ 30,000 in Arab@@ k@@ ir .
between the two districts , the local distribution companies provided US $ 20,000 .
these repairs were necessary in order to restore a reliable and safe distribution system .
the pilot projects were undertaken in two districts of Yerevan , each area having quite different circumstances .
electricity supply in the E@@ re@@ bun@@ i district had previously been highly unreliable and so the EC@@ O was able to greatly improve the quality of energy services available to households .
the Arab@@ k@@ ir district , on the other hand , had a major factory in the region and received a continuous ( 24 hour ) electricity supply .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment was rarely pen@@ alised and neither were cut @@@ -@@ @ offs imposed , thereby creating little incentive for households to pay their electricity bills .
however , despite these different characteristics , the EC@@ O system was effective in both districts , reducing non @@@ -@@ @ payment to manageable levels and almost eradicating theft .
payment levels were increased to more than 80 % of electricity consumption and further payment was received for arrears .
the EC@@ O in E@@ re@@ bun@@ i has been operating since September 1995 , although its legal basis could not be confirmed formally until March 1996 .
local problems were solved quickly and repairs efficiently implemented .
in a few instances supplies were temporarily cut off to building entr@@ ances to force non @@@ -@@ @ pay@@ ers to pay their arrears and on @@@ -@@ @ going monthly commit@@ ment@@ s. mit@@ ments .
figure 5 : pilot project results in the E@@ re@@ bun@@ i district
during the project , the average monthly payment increased to more than 80 % of electricity payable consumption and further payment was received for arrears .
the temporary drop in revenue for the beginning of 1996 reflected the expense of the New Year celebrations in Armenia but this was compensated for in February .
humanitarian schemes are also included such as ' Az@@ nav@@ our pour l '@@ Armen@@ ie ' which donated 100 kWh for the Yerevan population during the 1995 / 96 winter .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment has been reduced to around 15 % and primarily represents those households that are genuinely unable to pay .
during the period there was no damage reported in the network and peak loads have decreased as technical losses have been reduced .
illegal connections and other the@@ fts have virtually been eliminated as the improvement in security of supply has removed the need for such tam@@ pering .
strong management by the EC@@ O and support from neighbours has achieved the rest .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment has been reduced to those households that are genuinely unable to pay and represents around 15 % of consumption .
the EC@@ O has established a reserve to cover this revenue shortfall but in practice the poorest consumers are often supported by their wealthier neighbours on an informal basis .
ultimately it is anticipated that these lower income groups will receive support from a national social security provi@@ sion@@ . sion .
from the pilot project it appears the population is able to sustain an average monthly payment of 2000 to 2500 dr@@ ams ( US $ 5 @@@ -@@ @ 6 ) .
the official state salary is about US $ 10 per month although salaries in many enterprises are higher , in the order of US $ 50 in the energy sector .
often individuals have to wait several months to receive payment .
imposing higher tariffs for electricity consumption is simply likely to increase levels of non @@@ -@@ @ payment rather than generate additional revenue .
typical apartment building .
the scheme only reaches a small proportion of the genuinely ne@@ edy households .
the residents therefore had less incentive to pay bills than in E@@ re@@ bun@@ i where supplies had been highly erratic .
after the first two months of the Arab@@ k@@ ir scheme , overall revenue collection had increased but only to 60 % of consumption .
a fir@@ mer approach was then adopted to increase payment levels .
notices were posted on building entr@@ ances displaying their outstanding electricity debt and those that continued to avoid payment were cut off .
this was effective in demonstrating that the EC@@ O was serious about tackling the non @@@ -@@ @ payment issue and has since resulted in an improved payment pattern .
conclusions
the residential sector
the EC@@ O provides a framework through which non @@@ -@@ @ payment can be reduced to manageable and acceptable levels .
when local people can determine the quality and maintenance of their own electricity supplies many problems are resolved quickly and efficiently by consumers themselves .
the EC@@ O provides the framework for these actions , including the virtual elimination of illegal connections and resolution of disputes with individuals who refuse or are unable to pay for their electricity use .
the pilot projects demonstrated that the majority of consumers are willing to pay for a reliable and secure energy supply , and that non @@@ -@@ @ payment can be reduced to manageable and acceptable levels .
only about 15 % of consumers were unable to pay in a timely manner and many of these had simply not been able to meet payment deadlines due to late issue of salaries .
only around 5 % of consumers were found to be genuinely unable or unwilling to pay .
rehabilitation of the electricity supply network is essential not only to provide better quality and reliable supply but also to convince local people of the ability of the EC@@ O to initiate change on their behalf .
this was demonstrated in the pilot projects where prior to implementation less than 50 % of consumers believed the programme would be successful .
after the initial rehabilitation work this figure rose to 90 % showing a marked increase in confidence .
gaining the support of the public was imperative and widespread awareness cam ­ paig@@ ns were implemented In both pilot projects .
the main topics addressed were : • the overall energy situation • the role of the newly formed EC@@ O • the benefits and obligations for the individual house@@ holders .
the Government has created separate generation and distribution companies that ultimately will be financially independent and responsible for their individual operations .
the role of the state utility has been reduced to manage ment of the national transmission company .
the next stage is to establish the basis for legal power contracts between generation and distribution companies .
high levels of non @@@ -@@ @ payment have led to a critical and unsustainable situation , and an urgent need for reform of the energy sector .
achieving this scale of restructuring is a lengthy process and In the short term the Ministry of Energy has determined to manage billing and collection at the level of the low voltage sub@@ stations ( 0.4 k@@ V ) .
responsibility for timely payment rests with the consumers and distribution companies are instructed only to provide power to those sub@@ stations that can pay for their consumption .
given the current dire condition of the distribution system a widespread programme of meter installation and rehabilitation is necessary before this level of met@@ ering and billing can be implemented effectively .
the benefits will lie in the accurate measurement of consumption , tracking and reduction of energy losses and increased commercial account ability .
restructuring the energy system has involved the creation of separate generation and distribution companies -@@ only power transmission has been retained under state control .
beyond the pilot projects
eight new EC@@ Os and an information centre have been set up in Yerevan province .
following the success of the two pilot projects , a further eight EC@@ Os are being established in Yerevan province .
the T@@ ac@@ is programme has provided total support of US $ 150,000 for these ten projects with local distribution companies providing additional funding of US $ 50,000 .
in the long term EC@@ Os may be replaced by commercially based , cooperative utilities .
a Consumer Information Centre was therefore also set up within the T@@ ac@@ is project .
one of its activities has been to produce a series of television programmes discussing the new national energy strategy , the collection system and ways of improving energy efficiency .
the Centre also acts as a central en@@ quiry point giving specific advice to individuals on their energy @@@ -@@ @ related problems .
another important role of the Centre is to provide information and assistance to people or organisations wishing to establish an EC@@ O for their own neighbourhood .
the Centre was established and financed by the current T@@ ac@@ is project .
groups of neighbouring EC@@ Os may choose to merge to benefit from economies of scale and , ultimately , commercially based , public cooperative utilities may emerge .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment in other sectors
this project concentrated on the development of EC@@ Os to tackle non @@@ -@@ @ payment in the residential sector .
at the same time the energy crisis has forced the Government to import energy and to allocate it to a priority list of the most vital industrial activities .
apart from of a small number of priority list industries , organisations that fail to meet payment obligations will have their electricity supplies cut @@@ -@@ @ off .
more recently , economic necessity and pressure from international finance organisations has caused the Government to take firm steps to reduce industrial non @@@ -@@ @ payment .
the priority list has been limited to a small number of critical industries such as chemicals , irrigation and drinking water suppliers .
outside of these industries , organisations that do not pay for consumption face having their electricity supplies cut @@@ -@@ @ off .
now , however , most organisations must meet their energy obligations or face their electricity supply being cut @@@ -@@ @ off .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment has largely been tied to weaknesses in the Government 's budget discipline and in organisations ' financial policies .
several schemes have been suggested to improve payment in the government sector .
use of vou@@ chers would help in the transfer of budget to the energy company and a reward system that shared the value of energy savings between the Government and the organisation would encourage greater energy efficiency .
these types of measure require minimal investment and could be implemented relatively easily using energy statistics available from the utility companies .

some information on this brochure Use To save energy and reduce production costs by implementing no cost and low cost energy saving measures and energy management techniques .
Ukrainian and Russian steel industries consume 20 @@@ -@@ @ 30 % more energy than those in Western Europe .
this is in large part inherent in the type and age of the technology employed .
for example , in Ukraine an estimated 60 % of steel is produced in open hear@@ th furn@@ aces which are inefficient and highly poll@@ uting .
furn@@ aces of this type are no longer used in Western steel production because industry has been able to re@@ invest in new technologies which are more efficient and cleaner .
similarly , modern computer control systems are almost absent .
there are , therefore , substantial opportunities to save energy and reduce production costs by investment in new replacement technologies .
energy savings of 10 % can be achieved without significant investment .
however , significant savings , estimated at 10 % across the steel industry , can be realised without sizeable investment through improvements to existing technologies and changing working practices .
these areas are the subject of this guide .
the guide is based upon the results of a programme of energy audits carried out between July 1993 and June 1994 at iron and steel works In Ukraine and Russia .
these audits were undertaken by ID@@ OM with the support of the management and staff at the individual sites and the assistance of the Iron and Steel In@@ stitutes of Ukraine and Russia and the Russian Steel Corporation .
audited sites represent over 66 % of Ukrainian and Russian steel production .
seven iron and steel works were audited in Ukraine and nine in the Moscow , St Petersburg and Urals regions of Russia .
it was possible to visit four sites in Ukraine and a further four in Russia .
the other sites were audited and analysed via comprehensive written surveys .
the sites were selected to give a broad coverage of the industry and generally the largest works were chosen for the on @@@ -@@ @ site audits .

the annual production and energy saving potential of the nine Russian sites audited is given in Table 2 .
table 2 : the Russian steel plants audited in the study
potential energy saving
the measures can be classified into three distinct groups requiring different levels of investment : no cost , low cost and long @@@ -@@ @ term investment .
these groups were found to correspond to three generic types of measure : changes to working practices , efficient use of installed technology and investment in new plant .
the three groups of measures Identi@@ fied are shown in Table 3 together with the total energy savings potential estimated for the audited sites in Ukraine and Russia .
table 3 : energy saving opportunities identified at the audited sites

- very large
overall , the study concluded that possible savings in Ukraine were approximately 200@@ ,@@ 000@@ T@@ J / year representing 25 % of the present total consumption of the seven plants audited .
no cost and low cost measures account for over 40 % of the savings potential and their implementation alone could achieve an overall energy saving for the industry of around 10 % .
no cost and low cost measures account for 40 @@@ -@@ @ 50 % of the identified savings potential .
savings of a similar magnitude were identified for the nine Russian plants , with 50 % of the savings potential in no cost and low cost measures .
generally , the overall efficiencies of the Russian plants are a little higher than those in Ukraine .
however , there is still large scope for energy saving in both industries .
classification of energy saving measures by their economic performance depends upon a host of factors .
no cost measures are simple to define as requiring no investment in new equipment , although there will be commitment involved in changing working practices and providing training .
when equipment purchase is required the project can be assessed by investment appraisal techniques .
the " simple pay@@ back " for a project is an indication of the number of years required for the cumulative annual savings to pay back the initial investment .
it is useful for an Initi@@ al comparison of different projects but does not take into account the availability of funds .
in this guide , the three economic levels are defined as • No cost - no investment capital required .
these projects do not require investment and show immediate benefits . • Low cost - low investment cost or simple pay@@ back less than one year .
these projects will show rapid benefits and early adoption Is recommended .
savings are around 1@@ T@@ J per 1,000 EC@@ U .
no cost and low cost measures can be implemented immediately ; long @@@ -@@ @ term measures should be adopted as part of strategic restructuring .
these projects are difficult to justify in terms of energy alone and should be considered as a part of a strategic restructuring process .
energy savings are around 0.@@ 0@@ 3@@ T@@ J per 1,000 EC@@ U .
the principal motivation for these projects is likely to be in non @@@ -@@ @ energy benefits such as modernisation , new product capability , increased production volume , improved quality or a reduction in environmental pollution .
these do not require significant investment and so can be implemented immediately whilst long @@@ -@@ @ term financial restructuring programmes are put In place .
• effective combustion control • good condition of plant and regular maintenance • production scheduling • utilis@@ ation of most efficient plant • good house @@@ -@@ @ keeping
specific measures • reduce oxygen injection in LD steel making • substitute open lad@@ les with torpe@@ do lad@@ les • use better quality re@@ frac@@ tories in re@@ heating furn@@ aces .
no cost = change to working practices
these , then , are the two areas that will yield short @@@ -@@ @ term savings for little investment .
energy management provides the framework for successful implementation of efficiency measures .
operators need to be trained to close furnace doors and senior managers need to prioriti@@ se the recommendations they wish to Impl@@ ement .
a primary task Is to consider the following question : " how do you organise to manage energy in a large and complicated industry like the steel industry ? . "
the guide answers this question by introducing the concept of energy management .
energy saving opportunities exist throughout the steel making process .
the steel Industry involves many processing stages and diverse technologies .
here the Industry has been broken down into the main processing functions and the principal energy saving opportunities have been considered for each .
the main processing stages are shown in Figure 1 .
this section of the guide Is intended to give an insight into those aspects of the steel making process In which energy savings can be achieved .
specific recommendations are presented in a later section .
continuous C@@ asting ( sla@@ b / blo@@ om / bil@@ let )
the main stages of the steel making process and the most frequent energy saving opportunities are outlined below .
coke batteries ­ coke production . coke is produced independently from steel Man@@ u ­ fac@@ ture in Ukraine and so coke batteries were not included In the audits .
in Russia , coke batteries were generally found to be old and operating with very low efficiency .
15 of the 17 batteries audited were over 20 years old .
immediate replacement was recommended at two sites .
s@@ inter@@ ing ­ iron ore is ro@@ asted with coke and lim@@ estone to produce a clin@@ ker .
the plants are numerous and of small surface size .
replacement would yield an environmental benefit .
blast furn@@ aces ­ conversion of s@@ inter@@ ed ore In@@ to pig iron .
average fuel consumption of the Ukrainian blast furn@@ aces was found to be 19@@ ,@@ 2@@ 19.@@ 6@@ G@@ J / t , which is 14 % higher than that in the EU .
the most efficient blast furnace audited had a consumption of 17.@@ 5@@ G@@ J / t .
many of the furn@@ aces had low blast temperatures of 1,0@@ 50 ° C ­ 1,@@ 175 ° C and these were limited by the quality of the re@@ frac@@ tory used .
one site screens the incoming sin@@ ter and coke and this burden preparation leads to increased efficiency and less energy released in the top gas .
the study recommended that the double ­ bell top hop@@ pers should be replaced with more effective types such as Paul Wor@@ th or similar .
the study recommended that , rather than replacing obsolete coke batteries as they are taken out of service , pul@@ ver@@ ised coal could be injected directly In@@ to the furnace .
pig iron is transported In open lad@@ les and hot @@@ -@@ @ metal mix@@ ers .
the study recommended that open lad@@ les should progressively be substituted by more efficient torpe@@ do lad@@ les when routine replacement is required .
in this way a saving can be made without new investment .
this technology was pioneered in the former USSR and is now universally adopted In the EU and Japan .
open hear@@ th furn@@ aces have disappeared from Western Europe , yet are still widely used in Ukraine and Russia .
steel production - pig iron is sm@@ el@@ ted to steel .
steel Is produced in LD ste@@ el@@ works and the less efficient Martin Siemens open hear@@ th type .
the study recommended that oxygen injection in the LD ste@@ el@@ works should be reduced from 63 @@@ -@@ @ 76@@ N@@ m3 / t to the EU norm of 56 @@@ -@@ @ 60@@ N@@ m3 / t .
the open hear@@ th ste@@ el@@ works should gradually be replaced by LD types , or in the case of tube factories by electric arc furn@@ aces .
recovery and cooling of converter gas from the LD ste@@ el@@ works was recommended for subsequent use as boiler fuel .
three of the Russian sites had electric arc furn@@ aces ; however , insufficient transformer capacity pro@@ l@@ ongs melt times and increases specific energy consumption .
blo@@ oming and s@@ lab@@ bing mill and so@@ aking pits - used to produce and re@@ heat ing@@ ots for the rolling mill train . in the newest mills , efficient continuous casting techniques are employed .
excessively high energy consu@@ mptions were found In the majority of the furn@@ aces .
this was principally due to the poor condition of the furnace lining caused largely by inadequate re@@ frac@@ tory materials , combined with high excess air levels .
waste heat rec@@ uper@@ ators were Inst@@ alled on some furn@@ aces ; In some cases these were found to be too small .
many no cost and low cost measures apply to re@@ heating furn@@ aces .
the study recommended that equipment for monitoring and controlling excess air levels should be installed and , importantly , maintained and utilis@@ ed correctly .
the furn@@ aces should be maintained in good condition although the difficulty of purchasing high quality re@@ frac@@ tory materials was noted .
combustion controls on boilers are a simple and effective energy saving technique .
the audits found the monitoring equipment in the power plants ' steam boilers to be in a poor operating condition , leading to low levels of performance .
at the Ukrainian sites , 80 boilers were fitted with combustion monitoring equipment installed , yet only 31 were found to be functioning correctly .
the rest were either not working , unreliable or defective In some other way .
energy consumption in steel production
energy consumption charts provide a baseline from which efficiency opportunities can be identified .
energy audits were carried out in the steel plants and the specific energy consu@@ mptions of particular processes monitored separately .
this energy consumption data can be used to compare the performance of similar processes in different plants , Identi@@ fying good and poor levels of efficiency .
figure 2 shows the performance of all the re@@ heating furn@@ aces audited in Ukraine .
for comparison , the estimated improved performance of the furn@@ aces is presented , assu@@ m ­ ing that all the measures identified in the study were Impl@@ emented .
figure 2 : energy consumption per ton@@ ne of steel treated in Ukrainian re@@ heating furn@@ aces
the specific energy consumption can be seen to vary from 0.@@ 5@@ G@@ J to over 5@@ G@@ J per ton@@ ne of steel processed .
the European standard is generally 2 @@@ -@@ @ 3@@ G@@ J / L
similar sorts of consumption analyses were carried out on all the major plants and used to help Identi@@ fy measures to raise efficiency .
the study compared the efficiencies of the principal elements of the steel making process between those observed in Ukraine , Russia and the current standard in the EU .
the comparison is shown in Table 4 together with the percentage difference between the two .
table 4 : comparison of energy consumption - Ukraine , Russia and EU standard
the very large differences observed for steel making reflects the continued use of open hear@@ th furn@@ aces in Ukraine and Russia .
similarly , for s@@ lab@@ bing and continuous casting , the EU has a greater proportion of continuous casting plant .
the ste@@ el@@ works energy audits resulted In a large number of specific recommendations for no cost and low cost energy saving measures .
identification and successful implementation of such measures is achieved most effectively in the context of an energy management approach .
the principles of energy management are presented later in this guide .
no cost measures usually involve changes to working practices .
effective combustion control - high levels of excess air were common in the furn@@ aces and boilers of the majority of the steel plants visited .
this poor control of air / fuel ratio leads to inefficiency as a high proportion of the heat Is lost In the exhaust gases .
optimum efficiency is achieved with minimum toler@@ able excess air levels .
correct air / fuel ratios can be achieved by monitoring for oxygen in the fl@@ ue gases , eliminating air in@@ filtration , and servicing and adjusting bur@@ ners .
the bur@@ ners should be set up for correct air / fuel ratio at both high and low fire conditions .
furn@@ aces and boilers were often found to be poorly adjusted and in need of basic maintenance .
good condition of plant and regular maintenance - the audits found that despite many furn@@ aces being fitted with monitoring and control equipment , the equipment was often faulty or in@@ oper@@ able .
regular maintenance will ensure these systems are reliable and that plant Is thereby operated more efficiently .
furn@@ aces were found to have I@@ ll @@@ -@@ @ fitting doors and leak@@ y construction , leading to air entr@@ ain@@ ment , excess heat loss during non productive periods and extended heat @@@ -@@ @ up times .
similarly , electricity generation equipment and boiler plant rapidly lose efficiency If not adequately maintained .
production scheduling - significant energy Is lost through poor scheduling , where material C@@ AN@@ NOT be moved swiftly onto the next process .
good scheduling reduces holding times in furn@@ aces , where energy is required simply to maintain temperatures , and reduces the amount of re@@ heating needed .
the previous measures refer to techniques that can be applied generally throughout the steel industry .
reduced oxygen injection in LD steel making - the oxygen consumption in LD steel mills should be reduced from 63 @@@ -@@ @ 76@@ N@@ m3 / t to the EU norm of 55 @@@ -@@ @ 60@@ N@@ m3 / t .
the audits found oxygen levels as high as 150@@ N@@ m3 / t In one Ukrainian plant .
oxygen injection should be monitored and controlled appropriately .
substitution of open lad@@ les with torpe@@ do lad@@ les - open lad@@ les are commonly used in Ukraine and Russia for transporting mol@@ ten pig iron from the blast furnace to the steel making process .
use of torpe@@ do lad@@ les results in reduced heat loss and should be sub stitu@@ ted progressively as open lad@@ les need replacement .
better quality re@@ frac@@ tories in re@@ heating furn@@ aces - the quality of the re@@ frac@@ tory currently used imposes constraints on the operation temperature .
thermal shock and wear has also led to a deterioration in the re@@ frac@@ tory of many re@@ heating furn@@ aces .
this leads to excess air entr@@ ain@@ ment , uneven heating and reduced insulation property , each of which has a detrimental effect on efficiency .
low cost measures
these measures involve efficient use of installed technology , usually requiring a small investment , with a simple pay@@ back for the project In terms of energy saving of less than one year .
low cost measures commonly involve more efficient use of existing technologies .
screen out fines from blast furnace burden - fines introduced to the blast furnace with the normal burden merely add extra bulk that has to be heated and subsequently removed .
pre @@@ -@@ @ screening removes this unwanted material prior to introduction into the furnace .
substitute blast furnace double @@@ -@@ @ bell tops - old double @@@ -@@ @ bell blast furnace tops should gradually be replaced by more effective types such as Paul Wor@@ th or similar .
waste heat recovery for re@@ heat furn@@ aces re@@ heat furn@@ aces should be equipped with su@@ itably sized waste heat recovery systems .
combustion monitoring and control for boilers - as with furn@@ aces , boiler plants should be fitted with appropriate monitoring and control equipment .
where already fitted , it should be well maintained and utilis@@ ed .
importance of the energy management approach
this guide has identified energy saving measures that can be implemented at no or low investment cost .
by their nature these measures involve changes to working practices and adoption of energy saving techniques .
savings are made through behavi@@ our@@ al change , an awareness of energy w@@ ast@@ age and a commitment to operating and maintain ing plant in an efficient manner .
the principal components in establishing an energy management programme are as follows : lows :
energy audit - quanti@@ fying how energy is used and identifying energy saving opportun@@ iti@@ es@@ . ties .
responsibility and commitment - assign management responsibility for energy and establish commitment of top management to the energy saving programme .
implement initial no cost and low cost measures - a programme to implement the first projects is developed with full support and participation of managers .
motivation and training - operators and managers need training in good energy efficiency and new working practices .
on @@@ -@@ @ going energy saving plan - a coordinated programme to sustain existing projects and implement additional ones in a structured way .
energy should be considered as a key production raw material .
this guide provides only a short Introduction to energy management , yet Its significance in energy saving C@@ AN@@ NOT be underestimated .
energy should be considered in the same way as other key production raw materials .
in this way Its use and w@@ ast@@ age is understood and reported , and any misuse Is acted upon .
this is the essence of adopting an energy management approach .
in the remainder of this section , each of the principal elements of energy management are outlined .
they should not be considered as discrete activities but as stages in a structured and well @@@ -@@ @ thought @@@ -@@ @ out programme .
energy audit
importance of the energy management approach
other measures are only identified by more detailed analysis .
it also considers how production Is scheduled , how effectively plant Is utilis@@ ed and , importantly , how energy is managed .
from all this information a picture can be built up of where and how energy is used and who has responsibility for it .
audits look at how management of and responsibility for energy is organised on a site .
responsibility needs to be assigned at each relevant level for recording and reporting energy usage , from the boiler operator to the site manager .
many of the no cost energy savings are largely achievable through ensuring good staff awareness and understanding of energy usage .
the human element is more difficult to manage , requiring changes to attitudes , behaviour and established habits .
employees should be encouraged to avoid waste and take personal initiatives to save energy .
employees need to be motivated to save energy - appropriate training is needed to show them how .
achieving the necessary motivation and knowledge about energy ­ efficient practice will require training activities to be set up .
awareness of energy w@@ ast@@ age and good house ­ keeping can be rel@@ ayed through short presentations given by management to large groups of employees , complemented by poster campaigns or a newsletter .
some groups of employees , such as managers , supervisors and plant operators , have a greater In@@ flu@@ ence over energy consumption and will benefit from precisely targeted train ­ ing activities .
usually external trainers are necessary but It may be appropriate to train staff as internal trainers to continue the train ­ ing .
figure 3 shows the six major steps in developing a training programme .

analyse training requirements
an effective energy information system is required to provide the optimum level of energy and , where appropriate , cost information to each level of the organisation .
original met@@ ering levels are rarely found to be sufficient and so additional met@@ ering is normally required .
developing monitoring and targeting for a large works can be an extensive procedure .

this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the project described here@@ after .
results Major energy savings have been identified in energy supply and end @@@ -@@ @ use sectors through a policy of optim@@ ising use of resources .
the methodology is appropriate for other medium to large NIS municipalities after adjustment for climatic variations .
targets City administrations , regional and local energy utilities , housing owners and cooperatives .
the energy supply and demand situation in Tver is characteristic of other NIS municipalities .
the brochure aims to help municipalities , energy utilities , housing companies , and experts from federal and regional organisations .
in the City of Tver , major savings and efficiency improvements In energy supply and demand have been identified as a result of the pro ­ ject .
it is likely that opportunities to make similar savings exist in other NIS municipalities .
Tver is a regional centre 16@@ 0@@ km north @@@ -@@ @ west of Moscow In the direction of St Petersburg .
the city centre has maintained its historic character .
alongside its dominant textile and chemical industries and its mechanical engineering expertise , Tver has been able to pre ­ serve its cultural and scientific importance .
its development into an industrial city Is reflected in a rapid growth In population : today , the city has some 45@@ 8,000 inhabitants , compared with only 5@@ 3,@@ 500 in 1900 .
figure 1 shows the different aspects of energy supply and demand in Tver .

close cooperation between energy users and suppliers can achieve positive results .
for example , preparing district heat forecasts should involve consideration of new opportunities in met@@ ering , energy saving and the use of alternative energy carriers .
failure to include these could ultimately lead to un@@ economic surplus capacity in energy supply .

economic apprais@@ als were pet@@ formed by simple cost comparisons of different options .
table 1 shows , In simplified form , how to calculate the cost of a small co@@ generation scheme .
the annual cost of other options , such as heat ­ only boilers , can be calculated in a similar way .
table 1 : simplified cost calculation
the electricity credit may also need to be reduced to reflect any additional costs for back ­ up electricity grid connections .
legal and economic constraints also favour particular technologies , such as district heat ­ ing .
another standard effectively discrimin@@ ates against the use of central heating boilers below apartment blocks .
historically , a key feature of the former Soviet Union energy economy has been the very low level of energy prices .
comparisons of typical energy prices for consumers are shown in Fi@@ gu@@ res 3 and 4 .
natural gas , as the most valuable fuel , is cheaper than hard coal and fuel oil , and gas prices are lower for households than for large consumers .
on the energy supply side , low and distorted price levels do not encourage uti@@ li ­
price distortions discourage energy efficiency in supply and user energy saving measures .
ties to finance energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient , state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art technologies . on the demand side , low prices make energy saving measures economically un@@ attractive .

energy demand optim@@ isation
lack of met@@ ering and control inhib@@ its economic use of energy .
in Tver , and other parts of NIS , significant shares of heat and gas consumption in the residential and institutional sectors are not met@@ ered but are calculated according to set formul@@ ae for space and occupancy .
physically , they are unable to regulate their heat consumption due to a lack of control devices .
the major energy characteristics of the demand @@@ -@@ @ side sectors investigated are shown in Table 2 ( for comparison , figures In brackets indicate typical German averages ) .

figure 5 indicates the breakdown of total heat demand , district heating and electricity consumption by sectors .
for the residential sector the small living space per dwelling and per resident can be noted , as well as the inadequate building fabrics and non @@@ -@@ @ controlled heating systems .
the relatively low electricity consumption per resident indicates low uti@@ l ­ isation of electric household appliances .
electricity consumption Is actually met@@ ered .
increasing living standards and high comfort requirements will result in higher electricity demand in the future .
most households employ natural gas for cooking purposes , although this is not met@@ ered .

figure 8 shows the approach used to determine heat demand for two future scenarios .
the forecast heat demand is distinguished between currently existing and newly erected premises .
for existing premises , under the TR@@ EN@@ D scenario , heat energy demand in 2010 is deduc@@ ed assuming continuation of the status quo In 1992 .
no changes in build ­ ing fabric , heating and control systems and consumer behaviour are considered .
the EF@@ F@@ IC@@ I@@ EN@@ C@@ Y scenario assumes implementation of five packages of re@@ tro ­ fit energy saving measures assigned to the representative building types , as shown in Table 3 .

control and met@@ ering are the first essential measures .
only if actual consumption is charged can capital investments in energy efficiency lead to economically attractive decreased operating costs .
the introduction of new district heat sub@@ stations in each building is also Import@@ ant .
such building sub@@ stations ( see Figure 9 ) can be pre @@@ -@@ @ assembled in a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed form by factories .
cost / benefit analyses show that not all the insulation measures indicated are rec@@ om ­ men@@ ded for implementation in each building type .
due to the high capital investment required , external wall insulation requires poor thermal performance of the original con ­ struction before becoming economically viable .
improved thermal insulation for newly erected buildings is more cost @@@ -@@ @ effective than the retro@@ fit of existing ones and is thus highly recommended .

priority setting for saving measures
energy management in the city administration .
for the institutional sector , a database of more 300 consumers has been assembled .
an energy monitoring and management programme has been started using the database .
this satis@@ fies two key objectives : reduction of the municipal energy bud ­ get , and demonstration and guidance on best practice for other users .
16 factories employ about 40 % of the workforce and account for 36 % of the industrial heat and 54 % of the industrial electricity consumption .
however , the industrial sector has the most uncertain future under a mar ­ K@@ et economy . furthermore , its future pattern of energy supply is not clear .
at present , most factories are connected to the district heating network .
in future , sites may change to stand @@@ -@@ @ alone heat generation with direct gas , oil or coal firing .
industry faces an uncertain future .
its energy demand should be looked at on a case by case basis .
however , unlike the residential sector , industry C@@ AN@@ NOT be assessed by a uniform approach . industry structure , organisation and economic perspectives vary .
although industry is the largest energy user , doubts about its future should not deter progress in other sectors .
an overview of major characteristics of energy supply In Tver is shown in Table 4 ( figures in brackets indicate the German average ) .

the open distribution system on the district heating network has been the cause of continuous corrosion problems .
about 40 % of consumers are supplied by an open distribution system .
hot water for domestic use is directly tapped from the district heating network .
the interconnected network is supplied by three combined heat and power ( C@@ HP ) sta ­ tions and four boiler plants , quoted in Table 5 .
80 % of the fuel input is covered by nat@@ ur ­ al gas but almost every generation facility has a back @@@ -@@ @ up fuel source , as security of supply is essential in the harsh climate .
C@@ HP stations 1 and 4 are technically obsolete due to their extended operating lives and high maintenance costs .
co@@ generation in these stations and hence electricity output is marginal .

for the district heating network , industri@@ ally pre@@ fabricated composite plastic jacket pipes for direct underground installation are recommended for use on new network sections and for replacement of worn @@@ -@@ @ out sections subject to corrosion .

we R@@ ECO@@ MM@@ EN@@ D The use of CC@@ GT technology for future C@@ HP station replacement .
however , analysis has shown that existing C@@ HP stations 1 and 4 have greatly exceeded their technical service life .
the CC@@ GT process can achieve electricity ­ only eff@@ i ­ ci@@ encies of more than 50 % , instead of around 40 % by a modern steam cycle .
considering reserve and E@@ mer ­ gency issues , the peat ­ firing facilities should continue to be operated and can be renewed as necessary .
peat as the local fuel of the Tver region should remain available as back ­ up .
natural gas will continue to play a secondary role as fuel for direct space heating in the present residential sector , with district heating remaining the predominant energy carrier .
however , in new residential areas , smaller types of building such as detached and ter ­ rac@@ ed houses or small apartment buildings are envisaged .
particular solutions will need to be developed for each location and municipality in NIS .
two strategies , a TR@@ EN@@ D scenario and an EF@@ F@@ IC@@ I@@ EN@@ C@@ Y scenario ( respectively excluding and Inclu@@ ding specific attempts towards more energy efficiency ) , were dev@@ el ­ O@@ PE@@ D up to 2010 as the target date .
the EF@@ F@@ IC@@ I@@ EN@@ C@@ Y scenario demonstrates what can be achieved by an active energy management policy .
figure 19 indicates the heat demand forecast for the residential sector - probably the most certain field of prognosis .
figure 19 : residential heat energy demand in 1991 and 2010
new buildings
the TR@@ EN@@ D scenario assumes business as usual for already existing buildings , but the heat demand for new premises has to be added .
of the supply @@@ -@@ @ side options , a conventional steam @@@ -@@ @ cycle C@@ HP station was assumed for the TR@@ EN@@ D scenario and CC@@ GT C@@ HP stations for the EF@@ F@@ IC@@ I@@ EN@@ C@@ Y scenario .
figure 20 shows the balances for primary energy demand and CO2 emissions , exclu@@ d ­ ing the transport sector which was not analysed .
figure 20 : primary energy demand and CO emissions of the investigated sectors
107 % primary energy demand
both scenarios imply a moderate fuel diversification towards more carbon ­ intensive liquid and solid primary energy carriers .
hence , in the year 2010 , CO2 emissions will be slightly higher than primary energy demand in comparison to the 100 % 1991 levels .
the eff@@ i ­ ci@@ ency scenario is highly desirable in the context of the threat of global warming , but C@@ AN@@ NOT be achieved without investment of capital resources .

although this brochure deals with the specific case of a T@@ ac@@ is model , the major part of the methodology can be used for the creation of similar wholesale schemes .
targets Oblast and City authorities , potential entrepreneurs and training institutes .
the reasons for setting up a food wholesale market
in September 1993 , the T@@ ac@@ is project 91 / F@@ D@@ 0@@ 80 was launched by a British contractor , Pro@@ duce Studies Ltd , New@@ bury , selected by the Commission of the European Union .
it also provided an opportunity for producers , wholes@@ al@@ ers and retailers to work together In order to fulfil the food needs of the City .
cities that have already copied the model in some way , or who are currently pursuing developments based on the model 's design are increasing In number .
early results suggest that the experience of these new markets mirrors that of the Tog@@ li@@ atti model and common lessons can be learnt from both .
for the market to remain successful and to continue to play an active role in food distribution , it was necessary to follow the structured development programme outlined in this brochure .
cities actively pursuing wholesale schemes of similar type
having opened in July 1995 , the Samara wholesale market now provides pit@@ ches for 60 wholesale companies .
pitch size ranges from 15 - 50 m2 and the basic structure is of wire mesh .
main products are dry gro@@ cer@@ ies and fresh produce .
five companies have large walk @@@ -@@ @ In refriger@@ ators .
the market has an increasing customer base with 70 % of buyers from other cities .
regular customers have entrance tickets .
future plans include the refurb@@ ishment of a fourth trading chamber and the introduction of direct sales from lor@@ ries during the summer months .
the market opened in February 1996 , again on a former vegetable base .
it provides space for 28 wholes@@ aling companies selling a range of gro@@ cer@@ ies , wines , spirits , me@@ ats , dairy , fresh produce and confection@@ ery .
pitch size ranges from 18 - 120 m2 ( however , early results suggest that maximum pitch size should not exceed 70 m2 ) .
before the mar K@@ et was built City officials visited the Tog@@ li@@ atti model In order to fin@@ alise their own whole sale development plans .
future developments include the refurb@@ ishment of two adjoining trad@@ iri@@ g chambers so that a total of 90 trading pit@@ ches will be available by the end of the year .
traders from the southern republics and Asia will also be invited to sell goods from lor@@ ries during the summer months .
there are 23 companies working at the small market , Base No. 2 of the Tog@@ li@@ atti New City region .
trading area per pitch is 36 m2 .
ton@@ nage of fresh produce sold is 20 t / day , at a value of 100 million Rou@@ bles [ US $ 2@@ 1,000 - April 96 ] .
the market Director estimates that this figure represents 10 to 15 % of fresh produce sales In the New City region .

the market has recently compiled Its management accounts for the trading year 1994 / 95 , and these show an operating profit .
as a result of this positive performance , the City administration has approved additional capital expenditure to expand the trading area .
delegates from other cities continually visit the market , and some have decided to implement the market model In whole or In part .

food sector analysis
when improving a City 's food supply mechanism , it Is important to appreciate the current and likely future needs of the food sector , and those of the community .
building a wholesale market alone will not automatically improve the supply chain , unless it forms part of an overall food improvement package .
movement of fruit into the market shortly after the official opening .
when setting up any new business , It Is necessary to consider the needs of potential customers , particularly those who will be providing the majority of its income .
Tog@@ li@@ atti buyers in particular required : • a wide range of food items • constant availability • wholesale prices • credit • delivery service • the market to be open six days a week .
a number of wholes@@ al@@ ers were already operating in Tog@@ li@@ atti when the project began its work .
in most cases , they had rented warehouse space from vegetable bases or commercial establishments throughout the City .
although in most cases wholes@@ al@@ ers were operating prof@@ itably , they were finding it increasingly difficult to attract buyers to their premises unless they continually expanded their product range and advertised regularly .
display of local farm cab@@ b@@ ages .
the municipal authorities in all cities have a responsibility in ensuring that the food supplies are sufficient for its inhabitants .
it is important to note that the role of the municipality as an effective facilitator of whole sale trade was not automatically accepted by the wholesale community .
the traders were suspicious of the municipality 's involvement , and were concerned that the market would not be run under free market conditions .
after a number of discussions , it was accepted that the municipality was acting hon@@ our@@ ably towards the food trade and that there was no justification for concern .
the role of the Tog@@ li@@ atti W@@ hol@@ es@@ ale Market in the food chain
in the early stages of market development it is likely that product range will be more limit ed than when the market has become fully operational .
for this reason , it is important to choose those product categories which are in high demand in order to attract sufficient interest from buyers in the early days .
once the market has become established , additional categories or services can be added to suit local demand .
the category of goods in the wholesale model for the first six months were : • fresh vegetables • fresh fruit • dry gro@@ cer@@ ies • wines and spirits • luxury food items [ chocol@@ ates , sweets and tobacco ] .
a number of sites were inspected and their potential assessed .
one green field site [ virgin land without services such as water and electricity ] was considered , along with premises that were vacant , such as the City 's former municipal food bases .
it was assumed that buyers would be prepared to travel up to 1 / 2 hour to reach the market and that good road communications would play a vital part in attracting potential customers .
calculation of required capital costs ruled out the possibility of a green field site .
the base also had the advantage of being well known to the food trade and easy for future visitors to find .
figure 2 : plan of Tog@@ li@@ atti City and the location of the market site - Base No. 1 .
having identified the key criteria for improving Tog@@ li@@ atti 's food supply chain , the task of gaining support from the municipality and the business community was relatively easy .
by publicly addressing the needs of both suppliers and buyers , there was little objection to the new market 's introduction .
a wholesale market aims to organise the City food supply and encourage profitable development of trading activities .
it requires the full support of the Municipality and the business community .
it Is often assumed that such promotion is costly , yet the project found it relatively easy to attract attention because it was a worthy new item .
the view of the project was , that the more people who knew about the market the better .
it was also important to attract buyers and key persons from other regions , so they too could pass on the word to others .
care was taken at this stage to make it clear that the market was not aimed at the house@@ wife and that retail establishments would still serve the needs of the domestic buyer .
local radio representatives were invited to attend the official opening of the market and report on its popularity and product range .
later , during the first three months of trading , information on prices and product availability was transmitted .
two local television companies covered the opening of the market and the subsequent opening of other trading chambers .
wholesale markets were installed in former food bases in Tog@@ li@@ atti ...
.@@ and in Kemerovo .
in order to maxim@@ ise the effectiveness of capital funds , an analysis of the potential refurb@@ ishment costs and rental income was undertaken .
a feasibility plan detailed development options which could be implemented over a five year period .
affordable phased development
a phased development programme allowing a steady release of funds from the municipal budget was approved by the City .
a conservative phased development of the wholesale market minim@@ ises the risk for the promo@@ ter and enables a permanent balance between offer and demand for commercial pit@@ ches .
hours of trading
as with all markets , it is imperative that all wholes@@ al@@ ers observe the agreed opening times of the market .
assuming that the market 's prices are reasonable , the greatest encouragement to a commercial food buyer to use the facility is the availability of product choice .
the product range of the model continues to expand as a result of encouragement from the market management , and due to the initiative of participating wholes@@ al@@ ers .
in the case of the model , it quickly became apparent that the larger commercial buyers required a delivery service .
in order to cater for this , the wholesale market offers a delivery service to wholes@@ al@@ ers who wish to dispatch goods to their customers .
charges for vehicles and drivers are made on an hourly basis directly to the wholes@@ aler concerned .
this arrange ments allows for more effective handling and allows the wholes@@ aler to turnover substantially more goods than he would otherwise , based purely on the capacity of his pitch .
methods of payment
a wholesale market enables wholes@@ al@@ ers and buyers to negotiate their own prices .
local transport companies have to develop the necessary skills to ensure that goods can be moved quickly , economically , safely and to the clients specifications .
it is an important part of establishing the credibility of the wholesale market operation with new and international clients .
in Samara , a small transport company was helped by T@@ ac@@ is to develop these skills .
in the case of the model , wholes@@ al@@ ers chose to display prices and products on shel@@ ving close to the trading pitch entrance , so that buyers could assess what was on offer .
this particular aspect of the model , ( and the others developed as a result ) is probably the most important operational difference which distinguishes this market from western European markets .
health checks made by laboratory staff .
security of the products throughout the day and their safe keeping at night , are of paramount importance to those who trade in the market .
without adequate supervision by security personnel in the evening , goods from pit@@ ches are liable to be tam@@ pered with or stolen .
there is also concern about fire , as this would result in substantial claims by wholes@@ al@@ ers against the market management for lost or damaged product .
security throughout the day is equally important .
as well as petty thi@@ eving , there is always the temptation for more organised crime to remove goods from the site or interfere with those who are resident in the market .
photo@@ copies of such documentation are acceptable and whole sal@@ ers trading at the market need sufficient supplies of such copies to Issu@@ e to those who purchase goods at the market .
the laboratory also offers services to those outside the market who wish to obtain a health quality certificate and stamp for car@@ c@@ asses that will then be sold from other locations in the region .
wholes@@ al@@ ers who trade their goods at the market are required to stock their pit@@ ches throughout the year without interruption of
first wholes@@ aler to sign up for a trading pitch .
in all cases , the category of goods In@@ tended to be sold by the wholes@@ al@@ ers is inserted in the lease agreement [ the statement " F@@ resh fruit and vegetables , " or " Dry gro@@ cer@@ ies " etc . ] .
a 30 % discount for those trading in fresh produce was offered during the first 18 months of market operation .
this discount was dis@@ continued as it proved to be little incentive .
categories of lease : • fresh fruit and vegetables • dry grocery • wines and spirits • meat and dairy .
table 3 : rental payments for the period January - February 1996 .
it is important to note that for the first month of market trading , no rental charge was made to participating wholes@@ al@@ ers .
this gesture was to encourage participation of the wholesale trade in the early stages and to compensate for a low customer flow for the first four weeks of the market 's life .
to ensure that an efficient flow of goods is achieved and that safety is maintained in the market , it is important to separate the action of re @@@ -@@ @ stoc@@ king pit@@ ches from the selling activity .
attempting to do both will lead to cong@@ estion and a high risk of personal accident .
this size allows a suff@@ i ­ cient area for short term storage [ one to three days ] , and an adequate selling area at the front of the pitch .
larger wholes@@ al@@ ers have acquired larger pit@@ ches measuring 72 m2 and have managed to obtain an improvement in sales turnover .
however , those who have attempted to sell from areas in excess of this figure have seen little benefit and have returned to a smaller pitch .
when bringing a large group of people : og@@ ether with differing interests there is a require ment to introduce simple enforc@@ eable rules in the best interests of all concerned .
the example below ( Figure 5 ) has proved to be most effective at keeping order in the market and ensures that the risk of personal injury is minim@@ ised .
• wholesale trade on a daily basis with a daily payment . • It is prohibited to sub@@ let the trading pitch to a third party without informing the Administration .
the Trader will lose his trading space If he breaks this rule , the money he paid for the leasing will not be returned .
it is prohibited to deliver goods into pit@@ ches that do not have a quality certificate .
management
at certain stages of the market 's development , up to 70 % of participating wholes@@ al@@ ers were newly @@@ -@@ @ formed businesses using the market opportunity to secure a footh@@ old on the first run@@ g of an entrepreneurial ladder .
however , difficulties can arise with the appointment of the market management , as they will find it difficult to balance the needs of investors with those of the municipality representing the needs of the community as a whole .
the market philosophy , as described in the technical brochure , is cent@@ red around a facility ensuring fair trading opportunities to all wholes@@ al@@ ers .
private ownership runs the risk of failing in this basic principle .
management structure
the person in charge of the daily running of the market needs to be competent as a leader and as a manager of resources .
the Market Director is a major contribu@@ tory factor to the potential success of the market and selection of the best possible candidate should be given very careful consideration .
table 4 : the market 's current staff@@ ing levels
management
maintenance
once a market has lost discipline , it can take months or years to recover proper standards of cleanliness , co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ated pitch opening times and safe work practices .
therefore it is important for the market management to continually enforce working discipline .
wholes@@ al@@ ers must understand , that if they behave in@@ appropriately , it not only affects them , but also pen@@ al@@ ises the market as a whole .
the market management will give appropriate warnings to those wholes@@ al@@ ers who do not comply with their lease or who choose to contr@@ av@@ ene market rules , they will then remove persistent off@@ enders .
wholes@@ aler trader association
it includes representatives of the municipality , the management and a member of the traders association .
once the market had become established , an informal trade association was formed on the initiative of the resident wholes@@ al@@ ers .
the I@@ dea was for the wholes@@ al@@ ers to meet occasionally to discuss issues of common interest , so that as a group they might have an influence on the running of the market .
in response to this initiative , the market management arranged to meet the wholes@@ al@@ ers on a regular basis to discuss formally those subjects of concern or interest to the traders .
in addition the group elected a representative to serve on the market 's board of truste@@ es .
Board of truste@@ es
Board of truste@@ es meeting in December 1995 .
the board is made up of those who played a key role in the development of the market and who understand Its philosophy .
finance
if a market is to be affordable through local City funding , it is important to consider the speed at which money can be released for the necessary refurb@@ ishment programme .
in the case of Tog@@ li@@ atti , It was decided that funds would be made available in phases ( Table 5 ) .

beginning the refurb@@ ishment of chamber No. 1 .
the exploitation of the Tog@@ li@@ atti wholesale market proved profitable from the first year of operation .
it is not until these true costs have been identified , that the market management and the board of truste@@ es are sufficiently informed to make reasoned jud@@ gements on further capital expenditure .
table 6 : management profit and loss assessment ( April 1996 )
all business ventures comprise an element of risk .
without risk , there would be no opportunity to make trading margins or provide services or product to those in the food trade .
as has been highlighted throughout this brochure , a market is not just a building , it is a philosophy which requires constant effort and dedication to make it work .
the key to long term survival is the market 's ability to consistently provide a valued service to the food trade .
without positive benefit to the users , the market will become less attractive to the food sector , will run the risk of poor returns , and , at worst , will eventually have to close down .
30 % of the city food requirements are supplied by the Tog@@ li@@ att@@ ti market .
what has changed since the opening in October 1994
on the first day of opening trading space for 10 wholes@@ ales was available in the first chamber .
since then , a total of six chambers have been developed , providing space for 63 traders , all resident in the market throughout the year .
the market management accounts produced for the year 1994 / 95 , suggest that the market operates prof@@ itably and that further investment is justified to extend wholes@@ aler trading areas into nearby buildings .
this development will allow for controlled atmosphere conditions for the storage and sale of fresh fruit and vegetables to satisfy the demands of fresh produce tenants .
there is a current waiting list of over 50 wholesale companies who wish to become part of the market and who await newly developed space .
the market now consists of an array of wholes@@ al@@ ers who trade in a vast range of per@@ ishable and long life food goods ( Table 7 ) .

Board of truste@@ es

general service and maintenance staff
in the case of Tog@@ li@@ atti wholesale model , it took one year to establish a formal board of truste@@ es .
for those considering replication of such market development , it is advisable to establish a board of truste@@ es much sooner .
from our experience , the appointment of Board members is not a straightforward process .
it takes time to locate individuals with the capacity to think strategically and oper@@ ation@@ ally in the context of food distribution improvement .
it is also necessary to appoint those with the best interests of the market at heart , rather than their own person al gain .
the Board has now operated successfully for six months and has accepted its responsibilities well .
a representative from the wholes@@ al@@ ers association continues to attend .
the range of goods has continued to expand , ensuring more choice for buyers .
in particular , the addition of the meat and dairy sections has served to stimulate wider attendance and has conferred added interest to the market .
per@@ ishable products such as fresh meat ensure that buyers come to the market on a regular basis for their needs .
in order for the market to increase the ton@@ nage of fresh produce handled , plans are in place to develop nearby refriger@@ ated warehouses - just 200 m from the existing market building .
this new trading block will provide cooler temperatures for the fruit and vegetables products , and will give wholes@@ al@@ ers the opportunity to store products under temperature controlled conditions , in bulk .
quality of products
a large range of products is now available in Tog@@ li@@ atti market .
with the increase in wholes@@ aler numbers , healthy competition in the form of better pricing , service and quality of goods has been ensured .
this lesson has been particularly relevant to the three former state farms who trade at the market .
a range of quality , specifications and prices can now be found in the market .
wholesale companies determine their own quality standards and adjust them according to the su@@ c ­ c@@ ess of their sales and marketing policies .
the market is profitable and continues to attract investment from the City budget .
pitch rental has increased steadily over time to keep up with inflation and to repay the capital investment made .

importance of municipal support
without the continued support from colleagues in the Tog@@ li@@ atti City administration , the market as we see it today would not have been possible .
the market has established itself as a key element in Tog@@ li@@ atti 's food supply chain .
the venture is financially self@@ supporting and has proved to be a cost effective solution for those cities wishing to pursue wholesale market development at an affordable cost .
the market continues to maintain high standards of cleanliness , safety and service .
those who visit the market comment on its bright appearance and on the way operators display self @@@ -@@ @ discipline when handling goods .
the market maintains a positive image in the community and it is the management 's intention to maintain high standards .
for a market to operate efficiently it needs to attain a level of financial self sufficiency , commonly referred to as critical mass .
in the case of the market model , the break @@@ -@@ @ even point for the market to cover its costs was approximately 35 wholes@@ al@@ ers .
once critical mass is achieved , profitability becomes relatively easy and the market can confidently expand Its facilities to attract more users .
criteria for successful market replication by other cities
design
these who have already copied the market in some way have found the Tog@@ li@@ atti costs to be a good guide , especially at the stage of securing municipal funds and putting the building work out to tender .
it is for the leaders of subsequent market schemes to decide for them selves the driving forces in their own market , and to ensure that the people around them share in that vision .
T@@ AC@@ IS assistance and supporting material
those who are interested in learning more about the market model are welcome to con t@@ act the Tog@@ li@@ atti City Administration for further information , or to contact the market Director directly .
Tog@@ li@@ atti City is keen to assist other municipalities in the pursuit of wholesale market development and awaits your call .
the Moscow food wholesale market network
two W@@ FM categories have been identified : • major district / regional markets to serve mostly Moscow and its region .
an appropriate regulation is necessary to insure the development of wholesale markets in the city .
weak management would inevitably limit competition , with a risk of monopolies .
Moscow government will own a minimum 15 % of the joint stock company intended to finance general W@@ FM network research and invest in setting up specific W@@ F@@ Ms .
a first phase ( up to the year 2000 ) should provide for the establishment of two regional and seven medium @@@ -@@ @ size whole sale markets in Moscow .
as a first step in the implementation of this wholesale food market network in Moscow , in 1994 , a T@@ ac@@ is project started to implement a pilot wholesale market .
the selected site is O@@ trad@@ no@@ e , one of the Moscow 's 28 former food bases .
it will start operation at the end of 1996 .
conclusion
the Tog@@ li@@ atti model has proved to be affordable and sustainable through local City funding , and is compatible with the immediate trading pressures found in the local economy .

T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent . this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .

these headings deal with energy management from three different approaches res@@ pe@@ c ­ tively : • transport demand management • vehicle performance • the influence of transport infrastructure and traffic management on energy consum@@ p ­ tion .
key issues are outlined under each of the headings , supported with examples , where appropriate , from the four T@@ ac@@ is projects carried out .
( 1 ) Under this project , a brochure had been produced covering the findings of studies on energy savings within the Moscow City urban transport network .
part of the present brochure has been taken from it .
political , economic and social changes in the NIS have had a strong impact on the transport sector .
the political , economic and social changes that have swept the New Independent States ( NIS ) since the late 1980s have deeply affected all aspects of life .
their impact on the transport sector is already highly visible , although the change process is far from com ­ pl@@ ete .
although the actual numbers of vehicles in NIS cities are relatively small in comp@@ ar ­ Is@@ on to Western Europe , there is little room for complacency . this is due to several reasons :
common bus in use in Almaty .
box 1 : increase IN PR@@ IV@@ ATE CA@@ R O@@ W@@ N@@ ER@@ SH@@ IP ( M@@ OSC@@ O@@ W )
there are currently about 1.1 million cars compared to 56@@ 4,000 units in 1990 .
in fact , prior to the 1990s , individual mobility and particularly the number of person ­ al vehicles were limited .
with the introduction of liber@@ alisation , the rates of individual motor@@ isation have soared , -@@ despite the difficult economic situation .
petrol prices and availability have a much stronger influence on the distances ( km ) covered by private cars in NIS countries than in Western Europe .
box 2 : car O@@ W@@ N@@ ER@@ SH@@ IP AND CA@@ R USE ( ST PE@@ TER@@ SB@@ UR@@ G )
the St Petersburg Committee of State Statistics estimates that there were 49@@ 0,@@ 15@@ 9 cars in use in the City in December 1994 , a 69 % increase over the previous four years .
on the other hand , the total number of kilometres driven fell from 5@@ 67 million kilometres to 3@@ 47 million kilometres during the same period , a fall of 39 % .
the number of cars in the Oblast ( 10@@ 4,@@ 7@@ 73 ) also rose over the same period , but at a lower rate of 37 % .
whilst the total kilometres driven rose by 24 % , the average distance travelled by each car fell slightly .
the same pattern of rising vehicle numbers and falling distance travelled also applies to trucks in the city .
whilst the number of trucks rose by 27 % between 1990 and 1994 , the total distance travelled and the average distance travelled by each truck fell .
the major problem faced by road vehicle fle@@ ets for both passenger transport and freight transport is a lack of investment to replace old vehicles and maintain existing vehicles in good working order .
this is worsened by a lack of spare parts , inadequate maintenance tools and machinery and poor quality fuel and lubric@@ ating oils .
with investment in public transport systems , road infrastructure and freight transport companies , significant improvements in energy efficiency could be made .
vehicle choice
vehicle choice is an important aspect of energy efficiency in freight transport .
a vehicle should be chosen according to the load and the characteristics of the required journey .
for example this leads to small goods deliveries being carried out in vehicles much larger than necessary .
as the average fuel consumption of vehicles rises with vehicle size and weight there is an unnecessary consumption of fuel .
box 3 outlines the potential fuel savings which can be achieved by appropriate vehicle choice .
box 3 : fuel savings TH@@ RO@@ U@@ G@@ H AN appropriate CH@@ O@@ ICE OF VE@@ H@@ IC@@ LE S@@ IZ@@ E AND F@@ UE@@ L T@@ Y@@ PE ( ST PE@@ TER@@ SB@@ UR@@ G )
in the road freight transport sector , vehicle types differ from those found in west European cities .
fuel savings can be made as a result of using diesel rather than petrol eng@@ ined vehicles , par@@ tic@@ u ­ lar@@ ly in urban driving conditions .
however , the largest energy savings are likely to arise through the use of vehicles that are more appropriately sized for the tasks they undertake .
the substitution of a west European type light van for a Russian type light truck could reduce fuel consumption in city driving conditions by at least 50 % .
vehicle location systems can be used to help the real @@@ -@@ @ time scheduling of bus fle@@ ets as mentioned with reference to Almaty in Box 4 .
optimal routing and control of the buses could reduce overall mil@@ e@@ age .
this would increase availability and reduce fuel consumption .
these surveys should continue and be used to determine routes and frequencies of service .
critical points in the network can also be identified and more closely monitored .
this task would be much easier if more computers were available .
computer programmes are able to optim@@ ise vehicle and driver resources with passenger demand .
ideally , demand should be optim@@ ised using the city 's entire transport system - including trol@@ ley buses and tr@@ ams .
the City Motor Transport Association has already started to upgrade the system by installing new computers to control it .
in Europe driver training has resulted in fuel consumption savings of up to 20 % .
this would be particularly Import@@ ant if new vehicles are added to the fleet .
box 5 outlines the essential steps in a fuel economy training programme .
fuel economy training could be provided by the bus de@@ pot 's current trainers .
box 5 : fuel ECO@@ NO@@ M@@ Y TRA@@ IN@@ ING
these devices measure the actual fuel consumption of a specific vehicle in real time .
some devices also record engine speeds and road speeds .
these can then be used to point out bad practice and identify areas for improve ­ ment .
a European company produced fuel savings of 21 % with this technique .
How@@ ev@@ et , they are expensive - costing over $ 1500 per vehicle - and this would not be cost eff@@ ec ­ tive .
nevertheless , installation in one training vehicle would be highly appropriate .
it is essential to have the support of the drivers in any attempt to improve fuel economy .
box 6 gives an example of the scheme used in Minsk and Boris@@ ov .
in the companies surveyed in Minsk and Boris@@ ov , various bonus schemes were found to be in operation .
bus operators tended to give a bonus of up to 40 % of the market value of the fuel , which is equivalent to 70 % of the fuel cost paid by bus de@@ pots .
the freight operators used a similar scheme , but where long distances were involved the drivers were given money to purchase fuel .
these schemes show an advanced attitude on the part of the authorities in Belarus .
however , drivers are also pen@@ alised for ex@@ ces ­ sive fuel use , money is deduc@@ ted from their salary , or in the case of long distance journeys , the driver has to pay for fuel with his own money .
this breeds a negative attitude among drivers especially where they are unable to meet fuel consumption targets ( norms ) due to the po@@ or@@ quality of their vehicles .
if penalties are to continue , norms should be specific to individual vehicles and take account of their conditions .
effective vehicle maintenance systems are essential for safety , reliability and fuel effici@@ en ­ cy .
fuel @@@ -@@ @ related faults , engine faults , and In@@ correct idle speed settings are the most common faults found in vehicle inspection programmes .
programmes to ensure well maintained engines have been found typically to achieve a fuel saving of 5 % .
lack of maintenance can result in fuel con ­ su@@ mption penalties up to 40 % .
maintenance systems should be such that corrective action can be taken quickly .
two basic maintenance policies are commonly used in Europe :
corrective maintenance is the repair of unforeseen break@@ downs in workshops . this strategy is applied to low risk or random failures .
it has the advantage of simplicity but does lead to un@@ predicted failures .
preventive maintenance involves the development of maintenance schedules to be carried out at fixed intervals of time or distance travelled .
the required corrective action can then be scheduled and taken before further damage occurs .
Ο@@ η @@@ -@@ @ condition maintenance reduces the need for the systematic replacement of parts at the intervals specified by the manufacturer .
this means that vehicle parts can be used until the end of their useful life rather than their average life .
also , reliability is increased because the state of deteri@@ ora ­ tion of each part is known .
box 7 outlines vehicle maintenance in the companies sur ­ ve@@ yed in Minsk and Boris@@ ov .
the training of staff involved with maintenance is of vital importance .
quality control systems should be in place to ensure that all scheduled maintenance is carried out fully and that the correct instruments are used to make engine adjustments .
if car@@ bu@@ ret@@ tors or injection equipment are adjusted without using the correct equipment , vehicles will not achieve their optimum performance .
box 7 : vehicle MA@@ IN@@ T@@ EN@@ ANCE ( Minsk AND Boris@@ ov )
in Minsk and Boris@@ ov , maintenance ¡ s a combination of corrective and preventive maintenance with fixed services at 2 ­ 3@@ 500 km and 12 ­ 13@@ 000 km .
because of this , com ­ pon@@ ents are rarely replaced before they fail .
Ο@@ η ­ condition maintenance would have advantages for Minsk and Boris@@ ov bus and freight operations .
it would maxim@@ ise the working life of parts but replace them before failure .
Minsk and Boris@@ ov bus and freight de@@ pots ' maintenance systems could be convert ­ ed to ο@@ η ­ condition maintenance fairly readily .
each de@@ pot has a diagnostics station to which buses and trucks are sent at regular distance intervals .
each de@@ pot also carries out daily safety checks as the buses and trucks leave the de@@ pot .
the daily safety check could be used to monitor some parameters for ο@@ η ­ condition main@@ te ­ n@@ ance .
with some improvement to facilities and more modern equipment , the di@@ ag ­ no@@ stics stations could monitor more detailed parameters .
samples from engine lubric@@ ating oil systems could be taken and analysed .
oil anal@@ y ­ S@@ IS provides information on the condition of the oil and can indicate the optimum time to change it .

current practice inhib@@ its progress on savings .
ideally , the vehicle 's fuel tank should always be filled full on refu@@ elling so that an accurate record can be kept .
the ideal system for fuel monitoring would be an automated fuel dis ­ pen@@ sing system .
unfortunately this requires substantial Investment which is not feasible in most cases .
savings of up to 10 % have been demonstrated with installation of com ­ pu@@ ter@@ ised fuel monitoring systems in bus companies in England .
box 8 : fuel consumption norms
in addition , buses can have their norms increased by the following amounts under
although bus companies set norms for each route operated , in practice they do not vary much .
fuel leakage could occur from storage tanks or from the vehicles .
in some cases this might be in the form of drivers stealing any unused fuel at the end of their shift to sell or to use in private vehicles .
old bus can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised for spare parts .
fleet managers and vehicle operation and maintenance staff need incentives to save fuel and operate vehicles in a more fuel efficient man@@ or .
the structure of state owned trans ­ port companies in some NIS countries is such that the benefits of energy savings are not seen directly by the company saving the fuel .
control of de@@ pot finances is an important step in encouraging managers to achieve fuel savings .
the lack of spare parts experienced in many NIS countries limits the maintenance that can be done on vehicles .
often parts are made in workshops at the de@@ pots from cann@@ i ­ bal@@ ising redundant vehicles .
poor quality fuel leads to a less efficient running of vehicles and an increased fuel consumption .
the Chief Power Engineer in St Petersburg has established an effective system for monitoring all energy use by the Metro system .
this covers traction power as well as lighting , ventilation , drainage , escal@@ ators , maintenance de@@ pots and administrative services .
considerable savings have been achieved through ' good house@@ keeping ' ( with respect to energy monitoring and energy use ) .
for example , 1,@@ 00@@ 2 million ro@@ u ­ bles ( $ 2@@ 13@@ ,000 ) has been saved through improved management of Line 2 .
however , the City has not permitted these savings to be re@@ invested in further improvements in energy management , and little more can be achieved without investment .
similar energy monitoring systems could be implemented for tr@@ ams and trol@@ ley buses In St Petersburg .
trol@@ ley Bus powered by Electr@@ icity .
the speed and consistency of traffic flows has a marked impact on fuel consumption and resul@@ tant emissions .

strengthening of by @@@ -@@ @ pass roads and reserv@@ ing radi@@ al roads to public transport
10 % increase in commercial speed of public transport , fuel saving is about 9 % of car consumption on through @@@ -@@ @ centre routes
city centre parti@@ tioning Limited access zones in city centre
city centre parti@@ tioning can be implemented to restrict access to central districts by car , while facilitating access by public transport .
one of the least costly methods of doing this is dividing the centre into independent cells bran@@ ching off a peripheral ring road .
private cars have to use the ring road to move between cells , but public transport can move freely between cells .
legislation , regulation and enforcement
measures that discourage the use of private vehicles , thus reducing the numbers of ve@@ hi ­ cles on the road , will help alleviate cong@@ estion and contribute towards improving traffic flows .
road taxes and fuel prices are two powerful ways of slowing down the increase in pr@@ i ­ v@@ ate car ownership and use , but again these need to be enforced to be effective .
fuel is often sold on the black market cheaper than the pump price , and road taxes are non existent in many cases .
brief summar@@ ies of the case studies used in this report are set out below .
the resulting report includes assessment of five fleet operators in Belarus and makes recommendations for energy efficiency measures .
the aim of the project in Almaty was to analyse the energy performance of one public transport undertaking in Almaty .
bus transport accounts for over 75 % of passenger transport in Almaty .
it is clearly the most important mode and was therefore selected for assessment .
the objectives were to assess how energy was being used and to identify areas where savings could be made without reducing productivity .
the resulting report describes the assessment of the two bus de@@ pots in Almaty and the recommendations for energy efficiency measures .
general recommendations for fuel management in transport fle@@ ets
the aim of fuel management in transport is to achieve the maximum effective use of each unit of fuel bought .
scheduling and routing of vehicles should be driven by passenger demand for buses and customer demand for freight transport .
surveys and analysis should be used to determine routes , frequencies of public transport service , and the possibility of com ­ b@@ ining freight deliveries .
• An electrical pre@@ heating system should be considered for all buses and freight ve@@ hi ­ cles .
fuel Monitoring Recommend@@ ations o The graduated di@@ p@@ stick used for measuring the fuel content of vehicle tanks should be regularly calibr@@ ated and checked .
recommendations for demonstration and promotion • A transport Dem@@ on@@ stration Programme should be considered for both Belarus and Kazakhstan .
a detailed fuel management guide should be produced together with lists of relevant equipment and suppliers .
a bus company or a freight company can be used for such a demonstration programme .
traffic Meas@@ ure Recommend@@ ations o Current parking regulations should be strictly enforced , and tougher measures should be introduced in city centres and at critical points in the road network to aid traffic flows .
case specific recommendations
Minsk and Boris@@ ov ° Large freight vehicles should have restricted access to city centres in peak periods where cong@@ estion occurs on a regular basis .
Moscow
recommendations
in Moscow , the traffic control system ( START ) does not meet the requirements of current transport conditions .
the system is used more for traffic surveillance than for improving traffic flows .
therefore it is not possible to profit from the advantages offered by such a system .
the measures it implements must extend beyond the city centre to peripheral areas , where the problems are different .
parking regulations help alleviate street cong@@ estion provided they are integrated in the traffic management strategy and strictly applied .
the most difficult thing is to get people to accept them .
fuel management of bus fle@@ ets Moscow 's bus fleet includes about 500 units .
this figure alone shows the necessity to set up an energy management strategy in each bus de@@ pot .
in fact , there is a monitoring of fuel consumption within each fleet , but it is based on theoretical data which do not allow actual fuel consumption and supply to be monitored per vehicle .
to overcome this obstacle , each bus company should set up an autonomous energy management unit , develop training actions and adopt an adequate strategy regarding fleet renewal and maintenance .
furthermore , additional aspects linked to the use of compressed natural gas in public transport , and the organisation of fuel and car washing stations are also of interest for Moscow .
St Petersburg and the Leningrad region are a focal point in the transport network of the Russian Federation .
St Petersburg and the Leningrad Oblast has a vast potential for development , but a pre @@@ -@@ @ condition for growth is a well functioning and efficient transport network .
within the city , the role played by public transport is even more important than in west European cities because of the low level of private car own ­ ership .
the study carried out by ER@@ M in St Petersburg looked at the potential for energy savings in different sectors of the transport system ( road vehicles , metro and surface public transport ) .
St Petersburg has the basis of a very good public transport system , but investment is needed to improve its efficiency and bring it up to modern standards .
to let the system fall into decline would simply serve to increase overall energy consumption and enc@@ our ­ age the use of the private car , leading to increasing cong@@ estion and atmospheric poll@@ u ­ tion .
recommendations
the recommendations for energy saving measures in the transport sector included the following areas .
► Sub@@ stanti@@ al energy savings can be achieved through the replacement of existing freight transport vehicles .
however , the full benefits of the switch to new vehicles will not be realised unless appropriate vehicles are selected , and the optimum use made of them .
a unit should be established to transfer this ' know @@@ -@@ @ how ' and provide truck operators in St Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast with advice on truck fleet management , operation and vehicle replacement .
► One of the most significant problems for efficient freight vehicle operation in the city is the cong@@ estion caused by the inadequate road system .
a study should therefore be undertaken to assess the feasibility of introducing designated truck routes through the city and their potential benefit in terms of both reduced cong@@ estion and fuel savings .
► Sub@@ stanti@@ al energy savings are likely to be achievable through modernisation of street lighting .
replacement of existing tun@@ g@@ sten lighting units with modern mercury or high pressure sodium lamps typically results in energy savings of 70 to 90 % in electricity use .
a detailed study should be undertaken of the existing street lighting , its control systems , and the energy saving potential .
► The EC Energy Centre is currently undertaking an energy audit of the Metro system which is likely to identify substantial scope for further energy saving achievable through investment .
the largest savings would , however , be achieved through the replacement of existing trains with new , lighter rolling stock with regener@@ ative br@@ aking .
when this study is complete , a long term plan should be prepared for capital invest ­ ment in the metro system to improve the energy efficiency of the fixed equipment and the rolling stock .
► The lack of adequate and accessible data about the city will be a serious impedi@@ ment to both implementing energy saving measures in the transport sector and monitoring their effectiveness .
data should include the characteristics of the transport system ( e.g. route lengths ) , its use ( e.g. passengers or tonnes of freight transported ) , energy consumed , fuel type and prices .
the data should be expanded over time in order for changes to be monitored and comparisons made with other transport systems and other cities .
conclusion
the main conclusions and recommendations of the four case studies described can be summar@@ ised under the following headings .
those recommendations marked with the sign ( ° ) are the measures which are no cost or low cost , as opposed to those which require significant investment .
as can be seen from the list of recommendations above , many measures require investment , but there are effective measures that can be implemented that have very little cost associated with them .
energy savings in transport can be made in isolation , but should be looked at on a broader basis to maxim@@ ise savings .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent . this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the content of this document is one such action .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
situations can be similar , but are seldom identical .
this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the project described here@@ after .
seminars and training on the preparation of business plans , protection of intellectual property rights , n@@ é@@ go@@ ci@@ ation of commercial agreements , resolution of disputes were part of the developed subjects .

more knowledge leads to an improved level of trust and a better working relationship .
in the West , such conflicts are often avoided with the use of prior Investig@@ ation work and partner evaluation before significant relationships are entered into .
but of course even the best investigation process C@@ AN@@ NOT prevent or avoid every difficulty and even conflict .
if no compromise or agreement can be reached between the partners , then the claims process will be the final step in resolving business disputes between the companies .
the second section of this document deals with the resolution of eventual disputes .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
this section ¡ s designed to provide information on the due diligence process . it is not a comprehensive manual on conducting due diligence investigations .
nevertheless , the ideas and topics presented should give both NIS and foreign companies a basis for thinking about how to prepare for and design due diligence proceedings in the NIS cou@@ n ­ tries .
in building relations between any two companies , every manager wants the relationship to go smoothly .
a great majority of conflicts arise from misunderstandings about the other company 's goals , intentions , and capabilities .
for instance , does the company you are planning to work with want to invest in your firm , or do they just want to buy your products ?
such a simple distinction as this often becomes a problem if each company does not commun@@ i ­ C@@ ate its own In@@ ten@@ tions clearly or does not try to find out what the other company 's in@@ ten ­ tions are .
prevention is better than cure .
a St. Petersburg company entered In@@ to a joint venture with a British company to buy metals in Russia and export them to the West .
unfortunately , the Russian company did no due diligence on the British company beyond meeting a director of the company .
thus , the process of due diligence for co @@@ -@@ @ operative efforts in NIS countries ¡ s of special signi@@ fi ­ c@@ ance .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
this question may be put another way : what does a company stand to lose ¡ f things go wrong ?
figure 1 : a company with no due diligence process ...
some of the things that can be lost , if a business deal turns sour , are obvious .
loss of money is fairly easy to quanti@@ fy and , if the sum is modest and the business fundamentally sound , the company will sur ­ Vi@@ ve the experience .
the failure of an Import@@ ant deal might cost the management of a company their jobs .
another potential situation in the event of a failed deal or serious loss is the loss of con ­ fi@@ dence of both existing shareholders and also prospective shareholders and lenders .
this may lead to a fall in the value of a company 's shares as potential investors lose con ­ fi@@ dence in a company 's ability to successfully carry out future ventures .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
how is due diligence perceived by the parties in a transaction ?
for the target company , ¡ t sometimes seems as though the due diligence process is closer to corporate spying than to a legitimate business exercise .
due diligence is conducted not because of mistrust or suspicion , but often as a legal or business requirement which companies must abide by .
it may also serve to focus att@@ en ­ tion on current problems at the target company , which may be able to be resolved with the assistance of the potential investor .
as discussed below , the purpose of the due diligence process is to provide necessary and Import@@ ant information to each company ; this information is used to plan projects and transactions so that they have every chance of success .
five types of organisations may require an investigating company to conduct due dil@@ i ­ gence before entering In@@ to a significant business relationship . these are :
government .
in particular , the NIS com ­ p@@ any will have to show that it was reasonable to trust the foreign company by allowing it to perform its payment obligation after the NIS company had delivered goods .
business partners .
contracts with business partners may contain terms which obli@@ ge an Investig@@ ating company to carry out certain due diligence on potential business partners .
for example , ¡ f a company 's business involves manufacturing from raw materials and then selling its production , the company will have contracts with suppliers of raw materials and also with wholesale customers .
shareholders ' agreements and corporate foundation documents give shareholders certain rights .
this protects the share ­ holders from liability and / or loss in the event of management error or deliberate mismanagement .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
banks and other lenders obviously have an interest in the financial stability and prosperity of companies to whom they lend .
again , this is because the lender wants to ensure that the financial state of the tar ­ get company does not deteriorate rapidly after the target company has the lender 's money .
investment funds .
these regulations may also require the performance of due dil@@ i ­ gence procedures ¡ f an Investment fund is to be a direct or indirect party to the transaction .
conducting due diligence costs money , but ¡ s not as expensive as the cost of failed bus@@ i ­ ness deals .
the investigating company must make an assessment of how much it may lose if the deal goes wrong and then tailor the level of due diligence accordingly .
there is much that the investigating company can do relatively cheaply ; this is the first level of due diligence .
for major deals such as the creation of joint ventures , equity investment , or high @@@ -@@ @ value loans , the in @@@ -@@ @ depth analysis needed involves the use of professionals such as accountants and lawyers .
business partners
shareholders

undertake the first level of due diligence yourself .
companies should undertake the first level of due diligence on their own .
relatively simple and inexpensive due diligence techniques can be applied at this stage to provide more Information about a potential business partner .
figure 3 : first level of due diligence
credit references
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
the following types of first level due diligence might be conducted by the investigating company :
for example , the United Kingdom has three centr@@ alised company registers , whereas ¡ n Germany , companies are registered at local courts .
typically , one can learn some or all of the following information :
Bank references .
even where banks will give references , they tend to be very cautious .
references are often written in very general terms .
sometimes it is possible to ask the bank if they consider that their customer will be good for a certain level of credit ( i.e. risk ) .
the investigating company should bear two points in mind when evaluating bank references .
firstly , the reference can be no better than the bank that gives it .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
in most countries , membership of local trade associations or chambers of commerce is not compulsory .
the major subject areas that may be covered in a comprehensive second level due dil@@ i ­ gence exercise are outlined below .
much of second stage due diligence can and will be carried out by firms hired outside to conduct the investigation and acting on behalf of the investigating company .
carrying out due diligence entails much more than simply instruc@@ ting pro ­ f@@ ession@@ als , agreeing to their fees and waiting for their report .
depending on the level of due diligence , the target com ­ p@@ any can expect to be visited for any length of time from days to weeks .

preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
depending on the specific needs and Inter@@ ests of the investigating company , the amount of information requested and the form ¡ n which is to be presented will vary .
thoroughly examine the real existence and asset value of your partner .
this may consist of registered rights ( such as patents , copyright , design rights , and trademarks ) or un@@ registered " know @@@ -@@ @ how . "
thoroughly investigate your partner 's soc@@ alled " intellectual value and protection of property and rights . "
the investigating company will want to assess and value the target company 's intellec@@ tu ­ al property rights .
importance is an evaluation of the legal Issues related to Intellectual property .
is the target company the licen@@ ser or licen@@ see of any intellectual property rights ?
the investigating company will be concerned about the target company 's prote@@ c ­ tion of its intellectual property rights , not just in its home country but also Inter@@ na ­ tionally .
the general rule ¡ s that registration in one country does not protect an intellectual property right in another .
a ) Legal structure For many investigating companies , the legal structure of the company ¡ s one of the most important due diligence issues .
B ) Priv@@ atisation status of the company If the target company has been privati@@ sed , the investigating company will want to review all details of the privatisation .
the starting point for this process is the privatisation plan , although the investigating company will want to review other documents relating to the plan .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
the results of marketing research are the basis for forecasts and projections used to support investment decisions .
internal marketing Issues , those generally within the control of the company , are also of importance in the due diligence process .
the Information provided should also Inclu@@ de prospects for further product and service development based on customer response to current offerings .

look out for hidden tricks !
the Investig@@ ating company will need to find out all ¡ t can about possible future liabilities that may be imposed on the target company .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
often the investigating company will want to carry out a full environmental audit .
thus , a target company should not be sur@@ - * prised if lenders , as well as those seeking to buy the target company , take this matter very seriously .
guarantees are really contracts which come into effect from the moment of their signing but will not be enforced unless the party whose obligations are being guaranteed defaults on those obligations .
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
preventing conflicts : the due diligence process
the investigating company may be especially interested in finding out more about the target company 's individual customers .
the investigating company will also want to review the legal rights and obligations cre@@ at ­ ed by contracts with customers , as with any other contracts .
for example , existing exclusive supply or distribution contracts may be bre@@ ached by new agreements that the target company enters In@@ to with the investigating company .

conclusion
many NIS companies are now increasing their level of cooperation with foreign or domestic companies , either in search of investment or customers .
any company wishing to work with another , especially ¡ n the context of seeking investment , must be prepared for the due diligence process - either as the target company or the investigating comp@@ a ­ ny .
in NIS countries , due diligence holds special significance , as standard methods of ini ­ tial investigation used in Western countries are difficult to carry out here .
NIS companies should know that they will be subject to some investigation before any sizeable trans@@ ac ­ tion .
what is most important is that each case requires its own planning for due dil@@ i ­ gence ; no two relationships , no two companies , are precisely the same .
what might be important to one company or in one business venture might be meaningless for another .
however , the Information described in the sections above should serve as a general guid@@ eline for any due diligence exercise .
solving conflicts : negotiation , mediation or claims process
this chapter is In@@ tended to be of practical use to NIS companies faced with the prospect of having to solve a dispute that has arisen with a partner company .
where it is ne@@ c ­ ess@@ ary to refer to litigation and arbitration collectively this report will refer to the " claims process . "
although litigation and arbitration have many common features , the precise rules that one must follow when pursuing a claim vary not just from system to system but from country to country .
it is for this reason that companies will always expect to hire local lawyers to represent them in the claims process .
the claims process is the final step in resolving business disputes between companies .
the claims process is expensive , time consuming and disruptive even when it takes place within the borders of a single country .
psychology and market economies
one example of this is when they pick fights on matters of pr@@ in ­ ci@@ ple ; for example , spending $ 10,000 in lawyers fees to argue over a $ 1,000 contract .
this must be avoided . it is un@@ wise to let disputes form around personalities or hurt feel ­ ings - one should fight only when valuable economic Inter@@ ests are at stake .
people might behave ir@@ rationally and above all in highly emotional , conflicting situations
it is also important to remember the function of business reputation in a market Econ@@ o ­ my .
a company 's good reputation can soon be lost if it is known that it has engaged in fraud or sharp practice .
preparing conflicts before they arise
this preparation must take place as a company begins its relationship with another com ­ p@@ any , before any dispute has arisen .
to some extent , this ¡ s a little like taking a copy of the divorce laws to read on honeymoon " just in case . "
however , once again , a reputable Western firm will not be offended if a NIS company carries out routine checks on its organisation and asks ( say ) for bank or trade references .
preparing conflicts means considering how one can obtain a legal judgement and how it can be enforced .
you must consider how you will enforce any legal judgement you might obtain before you enter into any binding commitments with a business partner .
it is enough to say here that you should take very special care when contemplating entering into a business relationship with an offshore comp@@ a ­ ny .
otherwise you may find yourself in the disastrous position of not being able to enforce contractual obligations against the offshore company while it is able to enforce your obligations against you .
it ¡ s highly in@@ advisable for companies to draft arbitration clauses without the assistance of lawyers .
resolving disputes without using the formal claims process
the first and often overlooked alternative to su@@ ing ¡ s to do nothing .
this , as mentioned above , should be an economic decision , influenced perhaps by psychology .
it ¡ s probably fair to say that most breaches of obligations and non @@@ -@@ @ payment of small debts are dealt with by the agg@@ ri@@ eved company simply " writing off " the matter to experience .
negotiation
if you must do something then negotiation will be your next hope .
negotiations to settle disputes differ just as much as deals , firms and personalities .
solving conflicts : negotiation , mediation or claims process
perhaps one or both of the negotiators feels that concession or defeat would be a personal defeat .
more simply , the negotiators may desp@@ ise each other ; perhaps they have thrown personal insul@@ ts at one another .
( one option here , only possible in larger companies , is to change the negoti@@ ator ( s ) . )
solving conflicts : negotiation , mediation or claims process
this method will probably not work when there is a genuine dispute over the debt .
debt collection firms will charge a " success fee , " perhaps as much as 40 ­ 50 % of the debt .
the formal claims process
it is not so easy to describe the practical differences between litigation and arbitration .
both processes are expensive and both will occupy the time of lawyers and company managers .
as has already been mentioned , it is not enough simply to specify that the parties wish to have any disputes settled by arbitration . they must specify which organisation will con ­ duct the arbitration .
sometimes , the law of the country where the arbitration takes place will also govern the proceedings , especially if there is a gap in the rules .

arbitration court of Chamber of Commerce in NIS countries
if you can persuade a foreign company to accept arbitration at Chamber of Commerce in Russia then you should do so .
any award obtained from the tribunal can be enforced in any country that is a party to the New York Convention on the En@@ forcement of Arbitr@@ age Awards .
this is perhaps the most important decision that you will make In the entire claims process .
obviously , a personal recommendation would be best .
if you do not know any ­ one who has used a lawyer in a particular country then it may be that a lawyer in another country will have a contact in the country you are interested in .
this ¡ s particularly Import@@ ant when the work is of a specialist nature ( e.g. shipping or aviation @@@ -@@ @ related litigation ) .
the most important principle in most Western jurisdictions ( the US being an important exception ) is that the loser of a case pays the winner 's costs and his own .
however , a vic@@ tor will rarely get back all that he has spent .
once a case goes to court costs can be very high .
to ar@@ bit@@ rate a case at ( for example ) the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce can cost $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 , perhaps more ¡ f the case is particularly complex .
in some jurisdictions , e.g. in England , a foreign company must pay a deposit to the court before comm@@ encing proceedings against an English person or company .
if the foreign company loses the action the money will be used to pay the costs of the winning def@@ en ­ d@@ ant .
all Western countries have a system that enables judges to grant orders which compel a party to do something or refrain from doing something .
expert witnesses are very important . they can also be very expensive .
the most commonly used ¡ s " legal privilege " : where the document ( or part of it ) is one written by lawyers to the company for the purpose of giving advice to its client .
in the US the discovery process includes the taking of de@@ positions .
these are formally recorded cross @@@ -@@ @ examinations of witnesses ( including parties ) by lawyers .
their effect ¡ s that a witness is tied down , long before trial , to a certain story or set of facts .
if he changes that story later on he will be asked why .
enforcement of jud@@ gements
this question should have been in your mind from the very beginning .
NIS companies may face four different scenari@@ i when they come to try to enforce judge ­ ments ( or are up against foreign countries trying to enforce jud@@ gements against them ) . these are as follows :
figure 6 : four geographical alternatives of litigation
solving conflicts : negotiation , mediation or claims process
a purely domestic issue for NIS lawyers .
su@@ ing in NIS countries , enforcing in the West
if you have an award from the R@@ CC arbitration court then this can be enforced in any country which ¡ s a party to the N.@@ Y. Convention on the En@@ forcement of Arbitr@@ age Awards .
su@@ ing in the West , enforcing in the West
again , this is a purely domestic Issu@@ e and the process will depend on the law and pro@@ ce ­ d@@ ure of the country ¡ n which you are su@@ ing .
court awards can be similarly enforced , but this will depend on the existence and content of bi @@@ -@@ @ lateral treaties between the relevant countries ( or multi @@@ -@@ @ lateral treaties to which the two countries are parties ) .
su@@ ing in the West , enforcing in NIS countries
these are similar in all Western countries but what is now described is the English sys ­ tem .
you C@@ AN@@ NOT get blood out of a stone .
the state will not pay you if your defeated opponent C@@ AN@@ NOT • enforcement of the judgement will be effected by officers of the court .
solving conflicts : negotiation , mediation or claims process
if the defendant company refuses to co @@@ -@@ @ operate , the directors of the company can be forced to attend court to answer questions about the company 's finances and assets .
if the person summoned refuses to answer , he can be fined or sent to prison .
conclusion
as NIS countries enters the world market , more and more NIS companies are going to be involved in partnerships and cooperation operations with companies in other cou@@ n ­ tries .
but as NIS companies extend their network of alliances , conflicts between partners will inevitably arise .
successful partnership is a very difficult challenge .
but this is not enough .
conflicts are inherent to human relationships .
communication and negotiation can solve many of them but NIS companies must be prepared and fully aware of international mediation , arbitration and litigation methods .
this requires time , energy and resources and is to be weighed against the cost of loos@@ ing a conflict and ul@@ ti ­ mat@@ ely failing in a partnership operation .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
T@@ AC@@ IS works with 13 partner countries ( 12 NIS and Mongolia ) :
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the content of this document is one such action .

some information on this brochure Use This manual is an introduction to marketing practices , adapted to the general requirements of SM@@ E / SM@@ I in NIS Countries .
it describes the practical steps involved in the definition of a marketing strategy , definition of a marketing mix and preparation of a marketing plan in small or medium NIS enterprises .
targets Managers of small and medium size enterprises - Marketing departments of large companies - promo@@ ters of new ventures -@@ Training In@@ stitutes .
the privatisation and restructuring of enterprises are key elements in the transition stage now current in most NIS Countries .
the importance of Small and Medium Enterprises , or Small and Medium Industries ( SM@@ E / SM@@ Is ) is growing rapidly , in this context .
these documents are presented either in the form of technical brochures ( such as this one ) or are available in the T@@ DP E @@@ -@@ @ mail library .
set of subjects :
• Business Plan • Legal form of companies • Strategic management • Be successful in your business relations with the West • Creation of Joint Vent@@ ure
promotion
in this context , the project implemented a complete set of training documents mainly dedicated to large industries .
the present " Manual on marketing practices " is an adaptation to SM@@ E sector of the " Marketing training hand@@ book " prepared by the mentioned project ' .
the principle behind marketing is that all actions undertaken within an enterprise have to be oriented towards the final aim of satisfying customer needs .
( 1 ) Most of the figures presented in this manual have been taken from the Marketing training hand@@ book submitted by AT K@@ ear@@ ney to@@ EC / T@@ ac@@ isin@@ 1996 .
marketing is a two @@@ -@@ @ way process : strategy versus mix
marketing strategy includes : ► Seg@@ m@@ entation : dividing up the total market into segments called " product @@@ -@@ @ mar ­ kets . "
the SM@@ E must answer the question : " what products for what markets ? "
it must accurately define what it is going to analyse .
the segment identified ( the product @@@ -@@ @ market ) will be the basic working unit to be referred to . ► At@@ trac@@ tiveness : analysis of the opportunities and threats of the product @@@ -@@ @ mar ­ K@@ et .
analysis of the life cycle of the product @@@ -@@ @ market . ► Competi@@ tiveness : assessment of the SM@@ E 's ability to compete on this particular product @@@ -@@ @ market .
definition of competitive advantage .
this involves a suppl@@ y@@ based approach . ► Choice of the portfolio of products ( high attractiveness matching high compet@@ i ­ tiveness ) and of the right development strategy ( differentiation , costs , focus ) .
marketing Mi@@ x , a " wil@@ ful process , " is the operational version of the decisions made by the strategic marketing process .
it uses the four tactical means described above to implement the positioning determined in the analytical process .
product Price Promotion Place ( and distribution channels ) .
but also : ► The budget integrates the marketing process within the SM@@ E 's overall budget ► There should be a written marketing plan that summar@@ ises the company 's mar ­ keting strategy .
the plan is a guid@@ eline for all the people involved in the company 's marketing activities .

preparation Phase
you must be sure you have correctly defined your problem ( s ) ...
before entering the process of strategic marketing , it is necessary to define the depth of the necessary marketing analysis and to identify the major sources of information for data research .
the marketing process is a permanent activity of the SM@@ E .
but specific projects such as launching new products , conquest of new markets , international joint ventures , etc . , will require different levels of analysis .
the corresponding depth and degree of detail of the analysis should be determined according to the complexity of each problem , and the importance of the project for the SM@@ E .
figure 4 : problem classification matrix
importance of the project for the SM@@ E
novelty / complexity of the problem
the above problem classification matrix must be interpreted as follows :
type II requirements : - thorough analysis of problems - general consideration of the most important strategic alternatives - gradual refining of critical functional strategies .
type III requirements : - assessment and description of the problems relating to the project - drafting out the main concept .
type IV requirements : - straightforward assessment of project conditions - preparation of a concept based on the most important or critical aspects only .
identification of sources of information for data research
to obtain data for marketing analysis , there are two basic types of research .
in primary research data are collected specifically for the marketing analysis . sources of primary data may be :
in secondary research , use is made of data already existing .
segm@@ entation of target market
to focus the company 's interaction with its customers , it always makes sense to divide the markets into segments .

( 2 ) This methodology has been successfully implemented in different T@@ ac@@ is projects .

attractiveness of market segments
environmental scanning is the first step in a market analysis .
information from the com ­ p@@ any 's macro @@@ -@@ @ economic environment is monitored , evaluated and disseminated .
these activities should help the enterprise avoid surprises and ensure its long @@@ -@@ @ term health .
many companies ' operations depend heavily on the political environment .
for example , with the end of the cold war , the demand for arms decreased dramatically , forcing many companies to switch their production to civilian goods .
most companies were taken by surprise and had extreme difficulties in finding appropriate new products .
in general , four major areas in the macro @@@ -@@ @ economic environment have to be analysed :
political / legal
social / cultural
GNP trends Interest rates Money supply In@@ flation rates Un@@ employment levels W@@ age / price controls Dev@@ alu@@ ation / revaluation Energy availability and cost Dis@@ pos@@ able and discretionary income
this is the base for all economic analysis .

export market In the current international environment , export markets are becoming more profitable .
products are normally subject to a life cycle .
during the life cycle , the sales and profits may vary substantially .

each stage of the life cycle has its own characteristics , requiring different marketing approaches .

the critical success factors will be your " motto " and must be borne in mind at all times .
they are the most important things which must , or must not , happen if the com ­ p@@ any is to succeed on the particular product @@@ -@@ @ market .
the SM@@ E must discover and select 2 to 3 key success factors from the analysis of attractiveness of each market segment .
additional critical success factors will be defined after analysing the competitiveness of the company .
market economy is all about competition .
since both company sales and profits are influenced by direct and indirect competitors , a market analysis needs to examine them closely .
bargaining power of suppliers
bargaining power of buyers
the analysis of competitors aims at understanding the competitors ' business and str@@ ate ­ gy .
several questions have to be answered when analysing competitors :
do YOU HAV@@ E C@@ LE@@ AR AN@@ SW@@ ERS TO THE FO@@ L@@ LO@@ W@@ ING ?
do they have strong financial resources ?
are they well managed ? • What are the competitor 's goals and plans for the future ? • M@@ ight cooperation with the competitor make sense ?

the purpose is to define the position of each product or activity of the company with respect to those two independent dimensions .
different products ' standing as they relate to both the market and the company strength can then be described .
figure 15 : matrix attractiveness -@@ competitiveness
( business strengths ' )
( 1 ) Cri@@ tical success factors of the firm , largely controllable .
( 2 ) External factors , not controllable .
the development of a marketing strategy is based on the attractiveness of the segment market and the business strengths of the company .
as a matter of example , the follow ­ ing table gives generic marketing strategies generally chosen in different situation .
figure 16 : generic marketing strategies
sel@@ ec@@ tivity Main@@ tain overall position Se@@ ek cash flow Inv@@ est at maintenance level
sel@@ ec@@ tivity Identi@@ fy growth segments and special@@ ise Inv@@ est sel@@ ectively where profitability is good and risk low φ c
another element of the market strategy is the target position to be achieved on the mar ­ K@@ et .
the project 's profitability could vary with the market share .
if the focus is on a limited number of customers for a limited number of products , a small market share could mean high profits .
an increase in the market share will generate additional cost , and the total profitability could be lower .
finally , a very high market share position could generate economies of scale , and boost the profitability of a project .
three generic strategies could be envisaged :
a considerable market share is necessary before this strategy becomes profitable .
this Is an essential dimension for determining a marketing strategy .
market penetration The enterprise , acting on a particular market , al@@ ms at intensifying its market efforts : promotion , advertising , ...
the focus is on existing products .
market development The enterprises , based on existing products , try to reach new customers , new geo ­ graphical market , develop new distribution channels , ...
product development The enterprise aims at developing its product and finding new solutions for its cus ­ tom@@ ers .
diversification The enterprise aims at succeeding on new markets with new products .
competition and market expansion
any Incre@@ ase in the market share could come from expansion at the expense of compet@@ i ­ tors or from expansion of the market volume .
these are related strategies :
competition The strategy aims at winning market shares from the competitors .
such is the case , for example , when the market has reached saturation or maturity .
market expansion The strategy aims at obtaining a leading position vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis competitors during the development phase of the market .
the development of new products or the improvement of existing ones should always be aimed at creating a higher value for the customer .
this higher value can be achieved by offering higher quality , or a better technology , or a lower price .
when determining marketing strategy , the feasibility study should always consider possible alternative strategies .
the marketing mix describes the set of tools that a company uses to communicate with its customers .
it refers to the distinct features of an enterprise that become visible on the market place .
they are summar@@ ised by the four Ps : product , Price , Promotion and Place .
figure 17 : components of marketing mix
• How is the product benefit communicated to the customer ?
how and where is the product distributed and sold ?
the product needs to deliver value to the customer , or else it will not be bought .
if it does not fulfil the expectations of the customer , he or she will not purchase it again .
moreover , word will get around to prospective customers and they will avoid the product .
therefore , careful development of new products and continuous Im@@ pro@@ vement of existing products are vital .
furthermore , not only does the basic product need to fulfil the customers ' expectations , but additional features and services are also expected ( extras that add to the direct value of the product ) .
the three dimensions of a product are summar@@ ised below :
• Quality • Design • Technological sophistication • Reli@@ ability / durability
what kinds of packaging ?
what should the shelf life of the product be ?
what guarantees are being offered concerning quality and / or shelf life ?
setting the price has to be done after a careful analysis , taking customers ' perceptions , competitors ' prices and production costs into account .
in addition , strategies for market penetration have to be considered .
competition
for an existing product a price has normally already been established on the market place .
figure 20 : supply and demand
for some products , such as raw materials , a company will accept the market price since the product would not be bought at a higher price .
a lower price , on the other hand , would not make sense either , since buyers are willing to pay the market price .
for a wide variety of products that , unlike raw materials , are distingu@@ ishable , there can be many reasons to ask a price that is different to the market price .
a lower than market price can be chosen if a company wants to gain market shares .
in this market penetration strategy companies surrender some of the profit possible in order to gain long @@@ -@@ @ term profitability through high market shares .
in this strategy , companies build up high capacities and set a price below market pride .
thus , they gain market shares .
due to the higher volume , their costs fall and prices can be lowered further .
finally , the company has low costs and dominates the market so that profits can be achieved .
a low price may also be feasible If attractive follow @@@ -@@ @ up orders are expected .
low prices , however , might be regarded as a sign of low quality , so they should be accompanied by other marketing instruments .
in the long run , however , the prices have to cover all costs .
in the short term , at least the variable costs should be covered .
therefore , costs set a minimum boundary for prices .
higher than market prices can be asked if the product differs from competitors ' offers .
it might price its tractor at $ 100,000 , although a similar competitor 's tractor might be priced at $ 9@@ 0,000 .
and Enterprise " X " will obtain higher sales than the compet@@ i ­ tor !
1@@ 10,000 10,000 is the price to cover the value package discount
the stunned customer learns that although he is asked to pay a $ 10,000 premium for the " X " tractor , he is actually getting a $ 10,000 discount !
he ends up choosing the " X " tractor because he is convinced that its lifetime operating costs will be lower .
for products with in@@ elastic demand the demand does not change much with prices .
figure 21 : impact of elasticity on prices
price for product
there can be several reasons why buyers might be less price sensitive :
promotion
the aim of promotion is to introduce both the company and the product to the customer .
the same goes if the customer has a bad impression of the company or product . • Promotion serves to make customers aware of a company 's product .
the goal of promotional activity is to communicate messages to the potential buyer at all stages of the buying and consumption process :
figure 22 : the promotion process
customers are unlikely to purchase a product until they have gone through the logical process of A@@ ID@@ A .
figure 23 : the A@@ ID@@ A process
... and finally acting upon the desire .
they range from public relations with the aim of creating a company or product image to personal selling with the aim of making direct sales .
remember at each stage of the promotion process , clear messages have to be delivered to the customers to persuade them to ultimately buy the product of YOUR company .
figure 24 : promotional channels
public relations
1@@ A variety of actions designed to improve , maintain , or protect a company or product image .
1 Or@@ al presentation In a conversation with one or more prospective purch@@ asers for the purpose of making sales
sales promotions may include trade fairs where buyer and seller can meet at their mutual convenience .
personal selling is the part of promotion that is directly aimed at making contracts with customers .
these objectives have to be kept In mind when deciding on the size and structure of the sales force .
compensation of the sales force and the selection of sales representatives has to be followed by training and motivation measures .
how Is the advertising budget established ?
choice of media ( newspapers ; national , federal or local radio ; television , etc . ) ?
message and layout / format of advertisement ?
time planning of advertisement campaign ?
how is the advertising agent selected ?
special price actions ?
valid for how long ?
any promotional qui@@ z , contest or games ?
how are the midd@@ l@@ emen fitted in with these ?
public relations How are contacts with the press being maintained ( press releases , conferences ) ?
are there any information meetings , open days for visitors , excursions , etc . ?
are the members of the Board involved in public relations activities ?
are there any contacts with local authorities or other governmental organisations ?
publication of annual financial results ?
geographical or product specialised sales ?
how frequently are sales reports being made ?
how frequently are sales results being analysed ?
how often are sales meeting being held ?
how is the sales staff selected and recruited ?
is the staff trained in negotiation techniques ?
is hard selling being used or contempl@@ ated ?
products can reach customers in several ways .
customers can either obtain them directly from the factory or through a variety of distribution channels .
the structure of the distribution channel plays a major role in the marketing mix .
figure 25 : distribution channels for consumers foods
figure 26 : distribution channels for industrial foods
manufacturer 's representative
the choice of a distribution channel is a long ­ term decision that C@@ AN@@ NOT easily be changed .
also , the manufacturer 's influence on prices can be slight after the product enters the distribution channel .
his prestige on the consumer market may well be greater than the manufacturer 's .
nevertheless , the distribution channels are in most cases absolutely necessary for the manufacturer .
for example , it is difficult to im@@ ag ­ INE a company selling chew@@ ing gum in special stores or through travelling sales@@ men .
most producers would not even want to operate the distribution channel since their pr@@ of ­ It margin in the core business is higher than that of their retailers .
a distribution channel helps to link the producer with the customer and facilitates the necessary business transfers between them .
the marketing flows can be very complex since a single transaction normally initiates several flows of different nature .
figure 27 : different marketing flows
manufacturer
advertising agency ►
economic , control , and adaptive criteria should be considered when a company selects a distribution channel for its products .
figure 28 : criteria for the selection of a distribution channel
each channel alternative will produce a different level of sales and costs .
each channel involves some duration of commitment and loss of flexibility ; during this period other distribution channels may become more effective .

to evaluate the prospective intermediary closely one should take the following factors into account .
implementation of the marketing strategy must be carefully monitored so that one can react to unforeseen developments .
the people responsible for the various actions must report on the success of the actions .
if the actions defined turn out not to be efficient , alternatives must be worked out in order to reach the objectives .
monitoring can be the responsibility of a steering committee which should meet at monthly intervals .
the marketing plan should summar@@ ise a company 's marketing strategy .
the plan serves as a guid@@ eline for all the people involved in the company 's marketing activities .
it ranges from the market analysis to the projected financial results and control mechanisms .
detailed measures required to achieve the objectives of the marketing mix
traditionally , marketing departments were organised in functional sub ­ departments .
figure 30 : traditional organisation of marketing departments
manufacturing
marketing
advertising / promotion
as companies grew , however , these organisational structures proved not to be flexible enough .
different products might be sold on different markets , thus requiring special marketing attention .
therefore , companies started to re ­ organise their structure ( sub ­ system for industrial product groups ) in order to regain flexibility and reduce its difficulties in coordination with process .
figure 31 : normal evolution of flexibility / coordination with processes when companies are growing
organizational restructuring
difficulties in coordination with processes
figure 32 : central role of a product manager
the product manager is responsible for all the activities relating to his product .
product management means the performance of a specific product group in the market place can be closely monitored .
this makes it possible to avoid having a marketing department that focuses only on a few best @@@ -@@ @ liked products .
product management , on the other hand , has the disadvantage that similar tasks have to be fulfilled by each of the company 's product management units .
therefore , similar know ­ how is built up at different points .
the ability of product managers and functional managers to communicate with each other is crucial for the success of a matrix organisation .

marketing is inter@@ linked with all core processes .

perhaps this resulted from the limited time available , the diversity of the participants or an initial deficit in information which was too great .
this was more than adequately compensated for by the amazingly open and trust@@ ful dialogue which developed among the participants .
as a result of this new information the dis@@ orientation of the Western European participants grew - leading to intensified formal and informal discussion .
in order to find a common basis which would enable us to make as much progress as possible in such a short time we could not afford to waste time .
it is well @@@ -@@ @ known that where there are chances there also lur@@ k dangers .
in truth , we have much to learn from each other and must reconsider many things .
all the above mentioned examples lend support to our argument .
yes , youth exchange is indeed more important than ever in such times as these when we must all re@@ orient ourselves and seek to redefine the context of our lives .
the essence is this . • We need a new European programme for cooperation in the field of youth .
this pro ­ Gram@@ me is to be implemented in close co@@ ope ­ ration and coordination with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .

the dissolution of the military blocs awakened an immense optimism for the PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E here in Brandenburg , and also in the other new German L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
our premier , Mr. Stol@@ pe and I , too , pointed this out yesterday .
those dramatic changes went hand in hand with great economic and social upheavals , to which many people feel themselves exposed without defence and are thus experiencing a great feeling of insecurity .
in his summary yesterday , Mr. Bun@@ z , head of the EC Com@@ miss@@ i ­ on delegation in Germany , very frankly po@@ in ­ T@@ ed out that the European Community is not the fortress nor the strongh@@ old it is often per ­ c@@ ei@@ ved to be .

we , here in this strange East / West interface of Berlin and Pot@@ s@@ dam , have noticed that there are some people who even feel threatened by the ending of the separation between East and West .

'@@ Learning by doing ' ­ is a phrase which describes exactly the way we have been working since 1989 in the L@@ ä@@ n@@ der of the former G@@ DR .
I myself am not an administrator by profession , but a techn@@ i ­ cian having to deal with administrative struc@@ tu ­ res , and the same holds true for many of my colleagues in youth work .
we have set our@@ sel ­ ves the goal that such involvement will also be rewarded by the creation of a career structure with recognized qualifications .
in general , however , we must note that youth exchange between East and West is still in its infancy .
when compared to the youth exchange programmes in the countries of the European Community , we are only just begin ­ ning .
it is the aim of this conference to high ­ light the possibilities for , and limits to , East ­ West exchange programmes and to promote encounters and cooperation among young people of all European cou@@ n ­ tries .
but these exchange programmes are not just about friendly get ­ toge@@ thers of young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E from different countries .
coming back to youth exchange , we must be aware that the wishes of many young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E in Brandenburg , as in other parts of the former ' East ' , are directed toward the West .
we have to recognize that many Eastern Euro ­ pe@@ an youths are ori@@ enting themselves toward the West across Brandenburg , so to speak .
we are not offended by this , as our own situation is similar .
we know that youth exchange alone C@@ AN@@ NOT bring Europe together , and that it alone C@@ AN@@ NOT prevent a new social frontier from arising in Europe .
youth exchange is also about providing concrete help to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in building youth aid structures .
in view of the grave social disruptions in these countries our concrete solidarity is needed .
this does not mean , however , simply exporting ideas , structures and procedures from the West to the East .
not everything coming from the West is good , especially if Western experience does not fam@@ i ­ li@@ arize itself with the actual situation at hand .
but I am convinced that an enormous impetus for youth exchange can arise from this conference .
learning to understand other PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E better tends to have a snow@@ ball effect .
I am therefore very grateful to the European Community for looking after youth exchange between East and West and for providing the financial means for it .
I especially thank the Task Force Human Resources , Education , Tra@@ i ­ ning and Youth of Commission of the Europe ­ an Commun@@ ities for the generous support it is giving to this conference .
I wish you a very pleasant stay in Brandenburg .

words of welcome by Dr. Angela Merkel , German Minister for Women and Youth ,
in doing so , it is essential to sound out the possibilities for cooperation and to exchange information about experiences already gained .
during the past 40 years , a quite elaborate and time ­ tested system of youth aid has been developed , which is embedded in an efficient social and legal system .
in Germany , policy in the youth field , as in all others , eman@@ ates from the basic concept that the state does not have the responsibility to regulate all vic@@ is@@ sit@@ udes of life .
thus the primary task in the youth field is to help people in helping themselves .
while keeping state influence to a minimum , we want to support the various social groups and organizations in regulating their own affairs .
I understand President K@@ rav@@ chuk 's imp@@ ati ­ ence very well .
I am from Eastern Germany , from the former G@@ DR .
I am well acquainted with the problems and dangers inherent in the transition from a communist to a democratic social system and from a centrally managed economy to a socially oriented market economy .
the government of the Federal Republic of Germany , under the leadership of Helmut Kohl , is making great efforts to assist our Eastern neighbours in this difficult period .

this period in time is offering us the great and unprecedented opportunity of bringing all of Europe together in peace and freedom .
this is a perspective never offered before to a young generation .
now we have to meet our responsibility so that Europe 's youth may have a good future .
I am convinced that we can also learn from the countries where youth aid is still in the construction stage .
for we , too , need to constantly reconsider ways of getting out of the ru@@ t in order to be able to react to new tasks .
despite all persist@@ ing differences , a Euro pe with open borders will increasingly have to face problems jointly and we will be required to search for solutions together .
therefore , it is encouraging that the working groups of this conference should start to investigate such joint solutions .
youth exchange with Eastern Europe is of great importance for the Federal Republic of Germany .
our experiences with our French neighbour have shown that encounters between young people are a decisive factor in the process of reconciliation be t@@ ween nations and in providing a basis for solid friendship .
following the French @@@ -@@ @ German example , we have therefore established a joint youth work organization with Poland .
also , as a community of Western states we are charged with strengthening , within the framework of the EC and the Council of Euro pe , our bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation with our Central and Eastern European neighbours .
what we need is a kind of Ph@@ are programme for youth which would provide proper support to the development of youth structures .

about the organizers
it is evident that this process of European unification has consequences not only for the 12 EC Member States but also for the whole European continent .
both developments mutually influence each other , directly and indirectly , and thus , influence the shaping of the future of Europe , which can only be achieved together .
daily East @@@ -@@ @ West experience does not happen without friction .
such friction has been felt by young people as a painful rupture in their own lives and identities .
endless hopes and great moments of happiness accompany it , but it is also fraught with enormous disappointment and trauma .
Germany as a whole has changed , and so have these two federal L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
the Council of Europe , the European Parliament and the EC Commission have created the basis for this .
a change of systems , a change of values , recession , insecurity and the pain@@ st@@ aking process of helping new structures come into their own .
nothing remains untouched by these changes , neither schools , nor training , nor work , nor leisure time .
the philosophy of European youth exchange
in contrast , youth policy structures in the G@@ DR , as with all other areas of policy , were shaped by central government and large organizations . .
they are reflected in bilateral agreements and in Community programmes .
common concerns of the original initi@@ ators ( political deci@@ sion@@ makers in cooperation with strong youth associations ) , were , among others , the following :
unification has placed the Land of Berlin in a position of having to synchronize these two systems .
the Land of Brandenburg must accomplish a total reconstruction of state and county administrations , of the legal system , and carry out a comprehensive regional reform .

the European Community and its relations with third countries General information
European integration is not a concept which has been defined once and for all , but one which continues to develop .
the European Community is part of the " European home " or , to put it in broader terms , of " a new European architecture . "
its future shape will depend on influences from without and within .
the corner@@ stones are internal stability and an open door to the outside .
these are the fundamental principles according to which the European Community has been built up over the past decades .
it has been a process marked by endeav@@ ours both to " deepen " and to " broaden " the basis of the Community .
Maastricht , or the Treaty on European Union , has come to symbol@@ ize a new rate of activity in the European integration process .
in December 1991 the EC heads of state and government gathered in Maastricht to sign the treaties on the economic and monetary union as well as the political union .
this major reform has so far failed to bring the internal stability it was designed to promote .
there has been criticism that decisions taken at the EC level lack transparency .
fear of the new , a general sense of pessimism and political dis@@ affection have become widespread .
that 's why he 's calling for : • a return to our once lively political activities internally and efforts to increase our influence externally .

the first round of discussions ­ with several EF@@ TA countries ­ is due to be completed by 1995 .
conclusion : " the Community remains an anchor of stability on a map which has changed since 1989 .
preserving our achievements
the European Community is more than an economic community .
it is an economic and political union of 12 states .
it is also a community with shared legislation .
legislation at national level and everyday life with it are markedly influenced by Community decisions even today .
the EC is also a community of values .
its members feel committed to the fundamental humanitarian principles of freedom , democracy and pluralism .
and finally the EC is a community of solidarity between those who are economically stronger and those who are weaker .
but this principle does not only apply to exchanges between EC members .
that 's why the EC is so serious about its cooperation with and su@@ p ­ port for the developing world , as exemplified in the collaboration with the AC@@ P. states fol@@ lo ­ wing the Lom@@ é Convention .
reports · facts · opinions
the Single Market with its four fundamental freedoms was the driving force behind European union .
the abolition of border controls is the most visible sign that the Community is growing together on a political level and looking towards federal structures .
the Single Market itself calls for cooperation in domestic and foreign policy ( asylum , visas , trade , etc . ) .
so the EC is today much more than an economic community .
but it lacks suit able institutional structures , because collaboration between its members has made far greater head@@ way on a practical level than described in the various treaties .
Maastricht at least helps to plug this institutional gap .
European integration can also be viewed from a geopolitical angle .
the original Community of six has grown to twelve .
the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community describes the Community as open , namely open for any European country to join as long as it is prepared to help implement its principles .
another 8 countries have since filed applications to join ( Turkey , Morocco , Cyprus , Malta , Austria , Sweden , Finland , Norway ) .
the discrepancies of wealth and the political differences in an enlarged Community will require much stronger institutions than a Community of 12 .
the opening up of Central and Eastern Europe under@@ lines the urgency of institutional reform .
decision @@@ -@@ @ making in the Community
the member states have transferred decision @@@ -@@ @ making powers to the EC level .
nowadays it is the prerog@@ ative of the EC to decide on all matters relating to trade and tariffs , competition , coal and steel , agricultural and fisheries policy .
it is also responsible for en@@ acting guidelines in respect of research , transport , health , the environment and even some aspects of social policy .
although the Community has no armed forces , police or security service of its own , the member states are subject to its authority .
community law takes priority over national law .
every year the members states accept between 3000 and 4000 legal instruments ( regulations , directives , decisions ) .
the EC institutions have witnessed a certain growth in their power from year to year .
this has to do with a momentum of their own and with objective constraints rather than any attempt to monopol@@ ize decision @@@ -@@ @ making processes .
the second counter@@ balance , increased parliamentary control , was addressed with the Single European Act of 1986 .
the separation of powers in the European Community does not function according to M@@ on tes@@ qui@@ eu 's division among executive , legislative and judiciary .
this is not true of the Community .
instead the Community has a twin executive and a twin legislative .
the Community 's regulatory functions are based first and foremost on respect for the equality of all member states .
certainly , there is no lack of areas nowadays where decisions are taken by an absolute or a qualified majority .
this is breaking new ground in constitutional terms .
in fact , it is unprecedented in the history of associations formed by different states .
majority voting is becoming more common , with about 100 cases a year .
member states who find them@@ sel ­ ves in the minority accept the decision of the majority and proceed to implement comm@@ u ­ nity law as if they had voted in favour .
there is a Commission , a European Par@@ lia ­ ment , an Economic and Social Committee and a Council of Ministers .
the Commission puts forward proposals for legislation , where@@ upon the Parliament ­ and in most cases the Economic and Social Committee ­ comment on these proposals .
finally it is the Council of Ministers that decides .
but this is not sufficient to understand how Community legislation takes shape and how politics are carried on in Brussels , Luxembourg and Strasbourg .
the EC ­ Treaty refers to no less than five decision ­ making processes with different majorities , and the Treaty of Maastricht adds new ones .
so it is definitely wrong to assume that decisions are taken in Brussels by a handful of anonymous officials .
hence , E@@ G policy is a compromise between the Commission 's " European design " and the different desires and policies of the 12 member states .
the Treaty of Maastricht grants further responsibilities to the European Parliament .
it will be in a good position to monitor one executive body , namely the Commission , but have only limited powers to oversee the activities of the Council of Ministers .
there are both Econ@@ o ­ mic and political reasons for this .
European integration is considered a source of stability , security and welfare .
the basic terms and conditions are set out in Article 2@@ 37 of the E@@ EC ­ Treaty : " any European State may apply to become a member of the Community . "
countries acc@@ eding to the EC are required to adopt in full the acqu@@ is commun@@ aut@@ aire , the instrument already agreed in legally binding form by the existing member states .
this means that the accession threshold is raised with every move towards greater integration within the Community .
relations with Central and Eastern Europe The nations of Central and Eastern Europe in particular have placed high expectations in the EC and require extensive assistance .
the EC 's own interests are also at stake here , e.g. when it comes to preventing mass migration .
December 1991 : EC concludes the first " Europe Agre@@ ements " with Czechoslovakia , Poland and Hungary .
the association agreements are an attempt to break the vicious circle of economic crisis and political destabilization in the reform states and to make progress step by step towards restructuring and a free market economy .
the main objective is better access to the markets of the leading industrialized nations .
the Europe Agre@@ ements go much further .
EC member ­ ship is mentioned as a long ­ term goal in the pre@@ am@@ ble , but there is no provision for autom@@ a ­ tic accession .
and the Europe Agre@@ ements for the first time provide for political dialogue and cooperation in culture and the arts .
when a country joins the EC , it must accept the " aqu@@ is commun@@ aut@@ aire " in full .
any prospective member must be aware that today 's EC is not the yard ­ stick , but the economic and security union of the year 2000 .
two extensive programmes of assistance ( PH@@ ARE , T@@ AC@@ IS ) 6.1 PH@@ ARE :
support for democratization and the economic reform process in Central and Eastern Euro ­ pe , including the CIS and Georgia .
PH@@ ARE : originally intended only for Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia ( Poland and Hu@@ n ­ Gary Assistance for Reconstruction of the Economy ) .
since extended to 10 countries from the Baltic states to Albania .
the funds available are used to provide grants for : • technical assistance through consultants and experts • start ­ up financing and initial inventories • humanitarian aid .
reports · facts · opinions
6.2 T@@ AC@@ IS ( Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States ... and Georgia ) A programme to support economic reforms in regions which occupy a key position in the reform process .
difference from PH@@ ARE : the decisions on projects / campaigns are taken mainly be the EC Commission .
in the case of Central and Eastern Europe , the individual countries decide in what fields to provide grants .
its purpose is to provide assistance with the development " and renewal of higher education and the expansion of cooperation between partners from the countries eligible for support and institutions in the EC members states as well as the remaining G@@ 24 countries .
the focus of efforts is on mobility grants , university and academic cooperation and youth exchange .
Mr Alexand@@ ras T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is from the Task Force Human Resources will have more to say about the programme on 29 March 1993 .
sum@@ ming up : the great German writer Friedrich H@@ ö@@ l@@ der@@ lin wrote , " Never before have so many things been set in motion . "
he was referring to the revolutionary transformations of the time in which he lived , the late 18th century .
the old orders which divided us but also provided a degree of stability are disappearing .
at this stage of rapid change , the Community is seeking step by step , but no less determin@@ edly , the road to political union .
it offers the nations of Europe political stability and development prospects of a type they have never known before - and perhaps never will again - in their history .
the development of European youth encounter programmes by Alexand@@ ros T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is , Task Force Human Resources , Education , Training and Youth of the Commission of the European Commun@@ ities , Head of the Youth Department
historical and cultural context , aims , methods of action and perspectives
• Of the European Community 's 3@@ 40 million inhabitants , some 125 million are young people under the age of 25 : young people at school and university , in vocational training , young people at work or unemployed .
• The Community , which started life as a purely economic organization , has taken some time to turn its attention to the concept of human resources .
finally , it was only in 1985 that the European Council adopted the People 's Europe conclusions recomm@@ ending that youth exchanges within the community be promoted and a fully ­ fledged network of exchanges within and between the Member States set up .
in 1986 , the Commission proposed that the Member States should back exchanges of young people outside the context of school or vocational training .
two years of discussions were needed to overcome mis@@ gi@@ vings and differences of approach before the Ministers of the Member States adopted , in 1988 , the Youth for Europe programme .
reports · facts · opinions
the Youth for Europe programme has another special feature : it is the first Community programme organized on such a widely decentralized basis , i.e. by national agencies appointed by the various Member States .
• The first three @@@ -@@ @ year phase of the programme ended in December 1991 .
in this period some 85 000 young people took part in activities co @@@ -@@ @ financed under the Youth for Europe programme with an overall Community budget of almost EC@@ U 22 000 .
• The second phase of the programme was approved during the first Council of Ministers responsible for youth affairs in June 1991 .
• At the end of 1991 , the European Parliament gave the green light to the Pri@@ ority Actions in the youth field by approving a special budget heading of EC@@ U 5 million in 1992 .
in 1993 , it increased these resources by EC@@ U 500 000 and created a new sub @@@ -@@ @ chapter " youth policy " covering both the Pri@@ ority actions and the Youth for Europe programme .

• It is too early to draw general conclusions from the first year of operation of the Pri@@ ori ­ ty Actions in 1993 .
the Commission will continue to examine not only the projects initi@@ a ­ T@@ ed but also the trends that emerge in terms of the concerns , problems and interests of the young people involved .
• At this stage , the applications submitted for the Pri@@ ority Actions have confirmed the Commission 's conviction that the majority of young people in the Community are active and prepared to act as responsible citizens .
in addition , their often un@@ orthodox approach provides great potential for positive developments in our society .
• At the time of writing , the Commission is deliber@@ ating on the third phase of the Youth for Europe programme .
it is important to stress that one of the major by ­ products of this approach is the struggle against racism and xenophobia .

models adap@@ table to the new East / West programmes Streng@@ ths , experience gained and prospects
I would like to take up where Alexand@@ ras T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is left off .
I propose we start with the Youth for Europe programme .
the project is the framework for a learning experience essential to all exchange activities financed under the programme .
this learning experience associated with the exchange begins long before the actual encounter with the group or groups of partners .
this is why the programme places great importance on : • the involvement of the young people themselves in dev@@ ising the project ; • preparation for the activity ; • the educational framework of the project .
following this , each group met again to adjust its point of view according to the replies of its partners .
in this way , the final project was settled .
let us leave the 60 young people in Genoa for the time being and talk more generally of the programme of activities for the exchange itself .
the programme of activities must be designed so as to stimulate interaction between the young people .
it is here that the concept of exchange takes on its full meaning .
let us return to the 60 young people , who have arrived in a small village near Pal@@ er@@ mo .
• Before going home , they assessed the exchange together : its strong and weak points , the reasons for certain events , their experience , projects for the future .
they recoun@@ ted their experiences and discussed the suggestion put forward by the young English people .
other young people in each group are organizing an exchange to Birmingham with the help of the " old hands . "
like the preparations and the encounter itself , the assessment is an important and ind@@ i ­ sp@@ ens@@ able element in the exchange activities .
any example is necessarily schem@@ atic .
the exchange can take many different forms : some exchanges revol@@ ve around common interests , such as theatre , others around common concerns , such as the environment .
not all the youth leaders have experience of exchanges ; some do not know , or are not very familiar with , the countries with which they wish to organize the exchanges ; others have no exchange partners .
priority Actions in the youth field Un@@ fortunately there is not enough time to discuss the Pri@@ ority Actions in detail .
from a practical point of view , it must be borne in mind that the Pri@@ ority Actions are not a programme in the same way as the Youth for Europe programme is .
their implementation depends on an annual budget appropri@@ ation and they are administered centrally by the Commission of the European Commun@@ ities .
the Actions are not limited to the fields of exchanges and mobility , but cover the wider domain of work and youth policy proper .
their aim is to stimulate the cre@@ ati@@ vi ­ ty , involvement and spirit of initiative of young people .
one of the Pri@@ ority Actions is directly targeted at young people .
reports ■ facts · opinions
this involves study and training courses for youth leaders .
finally , as regards exchanges with non ­ Community countries , it should be noted that we are today still at the experimental stage .
this does not rule out support for pilot exchange projects granted on the basis of criteria and requirements similar to those apply ­ ing to the Youth for Europe programme .
conclusion To conclude , I would like to make the following points : 1 .
a youth exchange is never an isolated action but forms part of work on the ground with the young people .
it is a learning experience and contributes , as does all youth work , to the development of active citizenship . 2 .
at the beginning of my talk , I said that I preferred to talk in terms of useful experience rather than in terms of adap@@ table models .
because exchanges are meaningful only when they form part of an overall approach in the context of work on th@@ è ground .
it is essential to work together , with all the parties concerned , to create models that respond to the special needs and expectations of all involved .
building together where the experience of each can help the others , enabling all involved to review their pra@@ c ­ tice and adjust their approach .

youth policy structures in Europe by Peter L@@ aur@@ it@@ zen , Youth Directorate of the Council of Europe , European Youth Centre , Stras@@ burg
" Europe , today , is not a region of 12 but of 40 nations " said Jacques At@@ tal@@ i recently .
this is becoming increasingly true for the Council of Europe , where youth cooperation extends to the present 37 signat@@ ory parties to the Cultural Convention .
two weeks from now , ministers of some 40 European states will come together in Vienna , to develop a common vision on youth in greater Europe and to agree on a number of recommendations and resolutions .
youth policy structures differ from each other at many levels : at local , regional , national , European and international / world level .
but still , a representative study , covering all the countries of the " new Europe , " and using clear descriptions for youth policy develop ment does not exist .
perhaps the implementation of such a study would be a valuable project for discussion between the Commission and the Council of Europe when talking about concrete projects of cooperation .
my contribution will have to be restricted to introducing some of the difficulties which the authors of such a study would meet .
for this reason I will refrain from putting names to countries in such an introduction ; that should be reserved for a more complete and careful approach .
instead I will talk of " some regions in Europe , " of " certain countries " of , " one country " etc . , and you can make up your own minds .
reports · facts · opinions
how valid are these col@@ lo@@ qui@@ al groupings of countries ?
do certain neighbouring countries really have all the aff@@ in@@ ities and homogen@@ e@@ ities which outside observers attach to them ?
remember , also , we are talking about democracies here , so what may have been a certain youth policy understanding in a country may change substantially with a new government .
are we really any the wis@@ er knowing that there is no national youth authority at all or that the competence for youth is placed directly with the prime minister 's office ?
can youth policy be clearly distinguished from educational and labour market policies or are education and preparation for professional life the specific feature to refer to ?
to put it even more radically : where and when does youth policy influence the life of young people , if at all ?
youth is a social construction , which changes with the course of history .
consequently each generation and each culture has created its own understanding of youth .
it may touch on very sensitive items , concerning the inner coherence of a society , but may also deal with side issues , which may be very low down on the list of a government 's priorities .
instead , when young people are referred to , it is as trouble ­ makers , related to drugs , crime , violence and sex and thus they are treated as a problem .
this is where the problem lies .
however , these phenomena become open , aggressive and popular with young people when a society begins to lose faith in itself , and in its capacity to master the future .
on an international level , youth policy appears predominantly as a sub ­ category of for ­ e@@ ign cultural policy and is , not surprisingly , highly form@@ alized .
in any case , both the Council of Europe and the Commission , albeit for different reasons , are hes@@ itant to speak of a youth policy such as could be properly defined and legitim@@ ized in institutional terms .
the corner@@ stones of such a policy would be participation , mobility , training and inter@@ cultural learning .
turning back to national youth policies , I intend to follow the precautions which I spe@@ l ­ led out earlier , thus avoiding any strict classification of existing youth policies .
you will see that some of these understandings are contradictory to each other , hen ­ ce the cause of some of our difficulties in arriving at a common notion of youth policy .

the government as a Super ­ NGO , the " N@@ CO of NGO 's "
this is a government which steps into the domain of civil society and behaves either oc@@ ca ­ sionally or permanently as a kind of public conscience .
such governments run activities and projects by themselves , work with , through and above non ­ governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and largely by the same rules .
in this case youth policy measures are discussed and developed together with youth OR@@ GA ­ n@@ izations , agencies , youth services etc .
it would also insist that when people become legally adults they must all be treated in the same manner .
interventi@@ onist government Here I refer to governments which react exclusively to topical contemporary problems con ­ cer@@ ning young people , such as drug abuse , increase in violence and juvenile del@@ inqu@@ ency , unemployment etc .
the government reaction to these problems may be to provide large budgets but time is always limited in these cases and the government needs to produce some visible results quickly .
" father State 's " government
the government , confident in its role , acts as a sort of benevolent authority .
this role is basically the role of the big educ@@ ator who understands that young people need space to develop , that they need to be encouraged and , sometimes , punished .
the relationship between the government and NGOs is asymmetric ; there is a hierarchy and it has to be respected .
the controlling government
such government represents a nervous , insecure state authority .
it is in fact afraid of the reactions of young people and needs to be constantly informed about what " they " are plan ­ ning next .
the controlling government C@@ AN@@ NOT accept young people as an autonomous , cr@@ i ­ tical part of society .
its youth policy instruments will be used as a " pre ­ warning system . "
obviously no one member country of the European Community and the Council of Europe corresponds entirely to the approaches portrayed in this summary of youth policies in Europe .
but what about if we were to f@@ use some of these very basic ideal ­ types ?
are they really so far from the truth , once you have produced your own mixed assessment ?

having spoken about what might distinguish , I would now like to introduce what might unite .
in December 1992 in U@@ tre@@ cht in cooperation with the Commission and the Council of Europe , the youth authorities of the Netherlands held a conference on a similar theme .
on this occasion we were able to agree on 8 indicators which together are necessary for a national or international youth policy .
I would like to re@@ introduce these constituent elements :
youth policy should no longer be defined by what it is not and C@@ AN@@ NOT be , but rather by what it is asked to do and by what it can potentially do for young people .

background information on youth issues in Albania presented by Ari@@ an D@@ her@@ i , Ministry of Culture , Youth and Sports , Albania
prior to December 1990 , a special law prevented young people from being organized w@@ i thin different organizations .
the only existing organization was the Communist Youth Union , which was fully controlled by the Communist Party .
young people between 14 and 25 years old were obliged to become members of this Union .
one of the most severe punitive measures was expulsion from this Union , which carried further consequences .
the establishment of the new associations began in 1991 .
in August 1991 the Communist Youth Union was dissolved .
in August 1991 a youth department was set up in the Ministry of Culture , Youth and Sports , which is the prime state body dealing with youth issues .
now there are more than 100 youth associations in Albania .
the exact number of the young people participating in them is still unknown .
the main associations are : 1 .
Albanian Youth Federation 2 .
" youth and Art " Association 5 .
Albanian Soci@@ ologists Association 6 .
Albanian Theatre Association 7 .
" generation 22 , " 8 .
besides the independent youth associations , there are also youth forums affiliated to the different political parties , the number of which greatly sur@@ passes that of the associations .
the exodus , according to one source , has reached a figure of over 5@@ 50,000 people , of which 300,000 are young people .
they have gone to Greece , Italy , Germany , Austria , USA etc . the most tragic aspect of this exodus is that of the young people and children .
out of the 12,000 students registered at Tir@@ ana University in 1990 , 6,000 abandoned their studies in 1991 .
amongst them were '@@ new talents , artists , musicians and sportsmen seeking a better life abroad .
the implementation of the economic reforms necessary for the transformation of the Albanian socialist economy into a free market economy has caused several problems , notably that of employment .
unemployment has greatly affected the Albanian youth .
today it is a serious problem for the Albanian government , with approximately 60 % of Albanian youth unemployed .
according to the social assistance law , unemployed young people get 6@@ 30 LE@@ K per month ( equal to 7 USD ) while 1@@ kg meat costs 150 LE@@ K ( equal to 1.7 USD ) .
14 @@@ -@@ @ 15 year old pupils are registered in secondary schools ( 15@@ ,@@ 9@@ 95 females and 15@@ ,@@ 7@@ 15 males ) .
in the same year 26@@ ,@@ 280 young people finished the secondary schools ( 14@@ ,@@ 8@@ 32 females and 1@@ 1,@@ 4@@ 48 males ) , and after passing an entrance competition 5,@@ 4@@ 48 pupils entered university ( 2,@@ 9@@ 74 females ' and 2,@@ 4@@ 73 males ) .
youth policy situations in Europe
the secondary school education system is divided into : a ) general education b ) vocational education
the university has a capacity limited to 5,@@ 500 students per year .
those whose average is lower than 8 are not admitted .
young people now prefer either to engage in business or to emigr@@ ate rather than to pursue their studies .
a law prohibiting such behaviour no longer seems to exist .
AIDS is a disease , which according to the statistics , has not yet penetrated Albania .
to date no cases have been reported by the Albanian mass media ( newspapers or TV ) .
as for its preliminary prevention a series of programmes run by international institutions has already been implemented in Albania .
it is not as of yet a problem .
various experts consider Albania to be more of a market or a trafficking route than a consumer .
prostitution is still unknown in Albania , because it has been an isolated country .
contrary to the other Eastern countries this phenomena is not widespread .
mortality among the young people in Albania is the lowest in the Balkans , with a higher male mortality rate than female .

the Republic of Belarus is located in the heart of Europe and has borders with Poland , Lithuania and Latvia in the west , Ukraine in the south , Russia in the north and east .
it covers an area of 20@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 hectares and has a population of 10.@@ 2 million .
there are over 15,000 young job@@ less registered with the employment exchanges , and it is forecast that this figure may reach 7@@ 0,000 by the end of 1993 .
there has been a growth in migration , with about 15,000 people leaving Belarus to settle in other countries in 1992 .
the republic has a broad based education system catering for a quarter of all young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E .
however , in 1993 , only 30 % of university and college graduates will be assured of a job on completing their studies .
the number of suicides has doubled since 1970 , reaching 5@@ 57 in 1990 .
there has been a major growth in juvenile del@@ inqu@@ ency , which has almost doubled over the past three years .
all these problems are a matter of serious concern for the parliament and government of the Republic of Belarus . in April 1992 the Supreme Soviet adopted a Fundam@@ ent@@ als of Youth Policy Act .
the guiding principle of youth policy is to develop young people 's sense of initiative .
the Council of Ministers has approved a programme for the implementation of an official youth policy in 1993 ­ 94 , and the national budget for 1993 includes a separate article con ­ cer@@ ned with the financing of this programme .
the programme will be carried out , alongside ministries and government committees , by public youth organizations of which there are 28 at the moment .
youth policy situations in Europe
the main principle of relations between governmental bodies and nongovernmental organizations is that of non @@@ -@@ @ interference in each other 's affairs , with public financing for socially significant programmes launched by youth organizations .
a total of 175 million roubles has been ear@@ marked for this purpose in 1993 .
the National Council of Youth Organizations includes among its members two associations of young businessmen , namely the Youth Chamber and the Republican Association of Young Busin@@ esses and Organizations .

all over the world it is young people who represent the dynamic element in society , who pos@@ ess a keen sense of justice .
youth in Bulgaria is no exception to this rule , the majority of young people having actively supported the democratic changes implemented after the collapse of the long standing totalitarian regime of T@@ odor Shi@@ kov on 10 November 1989 .
the transition from centr@@ alism to a society of individual initiative and responsi@@ bil@@ ty is fraught with numerous difficulties and is accompanied by a dist@@ aste for organized activities and organizations .
that explains why there are at present only relatively few political OR@@ GA ­ n@@ izations for young people in Bulgaria , and why the structure of these organizations is often difficult to define .
young people play a particularly active part in the radical changes being made in the domestic economy and this activity is to a certain extent at the expense of their commitment to political questions .
the present period is characterized by the " get rich quick " mentality , which also influences the attitudes of youth to education and training .
in contrast to the recent past , the successful completion of university studies is not seen as something particularly worth striving for .
a number of political parties in Bulgaria have tried and are still trying to build up their own youth structures as a means of ensuring their future survival · .
the Youth Association of the Democratic Party is a member of the International Union of Christian ­ Democratic and Conservative Youth Organizations .
the Federation of Rad@@ ical Democratic Youth Clubs was the initi@@ ator for the foundation of a Liberal Cultural and Information Centre .
the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party under Dr. Peter Der@@ t@@ li@@ ev , which until mid 1991 was the largest and best organized political force within the UD@@ F , has also established its own youth organization .
however , the serious crisis in which the B@@ S@@ DP , now no longer a member of the UD@@ F , is going through , has also had consequences f@@ ó@@ r the young social democrats .
the successor of the Komsom@@ ol organization , the Bulgarian Democratic Youth ( B@@ D@@ Y ) , is based on the old Komsom@@ ol struc@@ tu ­ res and has concentrated on setting up groups outside the capital .
the B@@ D@@ Y has taken up a position in the political centre and its chairman , Ivan A@@ tan@@ as@@ sov , founded the daily news ­ paper , " Fax , " which was , however , only short@@ lived .
the Socialist Youth Organization ( SY@@ A ) is known for its harder line and closer contact with the B@@ SP , but it has fewer followers .
its chairman is Jur@@ i@@ j Boris@@ sov , a member of the B@@ SP parliamentary group .
the SY@@ A publishes the newspaper " De@@ k@@ or@@ atia , " in mock@@ ery of the UD@@ F newspaper " Dem@@ ok@@ rati@@ a . "
youth policy situations in Europe
the union , which was founded in 1990 , has virtually no influence and little support .
even more e@@ there@@ al is the Bulgarian Revolutionary Youth Party , founded in Varna by Angel Z@@ on@@ ev , which adam@@ antly takes up communist positions and which was the only political grouping in Bulgaria to come out in defence of the communist leader , T@@ odor Shi@@ kov .
doub@@ tless enjoying greater popularity , but with similarly opaque structures , are the Bulgarian student organizations .
the Association of Independent Student Uni@@ ons ( A@@ IS@@ U ) supports the introduction of democratic structures into academic life and the raising of the standards of university education in line with the requirements of the developed industrial countries .
the association was set up immediately after the 10 November 1989 , and was without a predecessor in the old regime .
this organization is a co@@ founder of the UD@@ F , and stands under the spiritual patronage of the author and democr@@ at , Jordan V@@ ass@@ ilev .
its influence primarily extends to young people and intellectuals in the university centres of Sofia , Veli@@ ko Tar@@ nov@@ o , P@@ lov@@ di@@ v , S@@ vis@@ ch@@ tov , Gab@@ ro@@ ve , Varna , Bur@@ gas and Bl@@ ago@@ ev@@ grad .
these sects have been successful in creating tightly knit nucle@@ uses among young people .

furthermore , we are also trying to render assistance in order to overcome the lack of opportunities for young people to take part in international life by way of personal contacts and to contribute to international understanding .
however , it should be noted that since the fall of the total@@ i ­ T@@ Ari@@ an regime , opportunities for young people , especially in this particular area , have mar ­ k@@ edly improved .
in the Czech Republic , international contacts between children and young people have been implemented in the framework of government programmes for the support and pro ­ tec@@ tion of the younger generation since 1991 .
exchange projects and stays at health resorts for handicapped and disabled children and youths were also supported and subsidized .
about 3@@ 5.@@ 000 young people took advantage of the above ­ mentioned projects .
above and beyond such exchanges in the framework of subsidized projects there are many other projects and activities , especially in the border areas , i.e. , between individual schools on either side of the frontier .
youth policy situations in Europe
programme number 1 is aimed at increasing the possibilities for travel , especially for young people without g@@ ain@@ ful employment .
it provides orientation towards participating in seminars , conferences and youth meetings of state and national importance on the basis of invitations issued by the host country .
it also includes support for youth exchanges , with priority being placed on such activities and projects as are carried out on the basis of inter ­ national agreements , with the main emphasis on getting to know the different peoples and cultures in Europe .
the government grants travelling expense allowances for confirmed projects .
meanwhile , work has started on govern ­ ment agreements with Poland , Hungary , the Ukraine and the Slovak Republic .
for our co ­ operation with each of the countries mentioned above the draft provides an amount of K@@ C 0.5 million .
further activities are being developed in cooperation with Belgium , Austria , Luxem@@ burg and Great Britain .
the cultural agreements signed with these countries include ■ paragraphs on joint youth work and youth exchanges .
at the present time work has started in the Czech Republic to implement a project for introducing the National System of Youth Cards .
a Youth Card Association was established in order to unite and reconcile , as an independent legal entity , the individual interests of young people , the interests of organized youth and the interests of the state organs in pro ­ mo@@ ting young people 's mobility .
we consider the Youth Card a means of providing direct support to the processes of in@@ te ­ gration which the Czech Republic is ke@@ enly interested in .
this system provides the op@@ port@@ u ­ nity , for both organized and non@@ organized youth , of active participation in social life , without any restrictive regional barriers and across the national frontiers of the European countries .
this project offers the young generation of the Czech Republic similar advantages and possibilities to establish contacts as are granted to young people in 22 other European countries .
creating the necessary conditions for the National Youth Card System is not easy .
to be able to benefit from all the advantages and possible facilities with respect to services and information which the Youth Card provides , and which makes it as attractive as it is , requires complex and difficult negotiations .
support by the state organs of the Youth Card , including '@@ financial support , is proof of the departure from the pat@@ ern@@ alism of the past when dealing with young people .
youth policy situations in Europe
information is the basis for young people 's mobility .
therefore a Czech centre for youth exchange was set up in 1992 .
step by step the Young People 's National Information System ( N@@ IC@@ EM ) .@@ is being linked to the international network ( e.g. Fi@@ do@@ Net , ER@@ Y@@ ICA ) .
( the point , above all , is the quest for a balance between trends towards di@@ ri@@ g@@ ism and pat@@ ern@@ alism on the one hand , and the pro@@ pen@@ sity to absolutely reject any ties between the citizens and the state on the other . )
another highly influential factor is the process of economic transformation .
we consider the young people 's entry into the adults ' world the key area in the soci@@ alization process .
measures are implemented not just for the sake of the young people , but , above all , to encourage their active cooperation .
youth work is characterized by the voluntary participation of young people in the activities offered , and they should be actively involved in their planning and implementation .
in the near future work shall commence on implementing the National Programme of Action for the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
further measures aimed at promoting the incorporation of young people in the process of European integration are being bro@@ ached .
through these programmes for the support and protection of the young generation certain priorities of state interest are being established .
this system of programmes and projects has proved to be worthwhile .
it provides the guarantee for a well @@@ -@@ @ directed and efficient use of state funds and stimulates young people 's own initiative .

the country has 1.@@ 56 million inhabitants of whom 0.@@ 96 million are ethnic Estonians .
Estonians have been living in the region for 5,000 years , and Estonia today has 66@@ 0,000 children and young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E up to the age of 29 .
Estonia is divided for administration purposes into 15 districts and six larger towns , the total number of towns being 57 .
education In the current 1992 @@@ -@@ @ 93 school year there are 2@@ 10,@@ 19@@ 1 pupils enrolled at the general and high schools ; 18@@ ,@@ 0@@ 58 pupils at 50 vocational schools ; 1@@ 1,@@ 8@@ 82 students at 36 technical schools and 24@@ ,@@ 2@@ 26 students at 13 universities and colleges .
back in 1936 the Estonian par ­ liam@@ ent enacted legislation on the work of youth organizations setting out a framework for relations between the authorities and independent youth organizations .
that same year a youth work department was established by the Ministry of Education and youth welfare committees were formed in the various districts .
prior to 1940 there were eight large , officially recognized youth organizations in Estonia ( with over 5@@ 5,000 members ) and a further 300 smaller organizations in the districts and regions .
but after the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 , all Estonian children 's and youth organizations were banned .
only three communist @@@ -@@ @ run children 's and youth organizations were permitted - the Oc@@ to@@ bri@@ sts , the Young Pi@@ one@@ ers and the Leninist Komsom@@ ol .
the re @@@ -@@ @ establishment of youth organizations The traditional and new children 's and youth organizations were resurrec@@ ted in 1988 , three years before Estonia regained its independence .
now , in 1993 , there are more than 60 active children 's , youth and student organizations plus youth organizations attached to political parties , such as the Young Christian Democrats and the Young Social Democrats .
despite the large number of youth associations , only 10 to 12 per cent of children are organized ( up to 30 per cent if you include the various sports and children 's clubs ) .
the EN@@ K is currently in the process of developing its activities and setting up its own offices .
government structures , In January 1990 , the Estonian government placed the responsibility for youth work with the Ministry of Education .
this was followed by the establishment of a youth department at the ministry at the end of October 1990 .
amongst other things , this department carried out youth research and worked on draft legislation of relevance to young people 's interests .

laws are required to develop such programmes , to get them moving and to implement them .
the Education Act of the Republic of Estonia ( which became law on 23 March 1992 ) interpre@@ ts the term education as including the encouragement of interests .
this is something which may take place at schools catering for particular interests , such as art and music schools , and hobby clubs ( work@@ groups ) active in the various institutions , places of work and schools or through the youth associations .
at the present time Estonia has 41 hobby clubs , 60 music and art schools , and 59 sports schools and children 's stadiums .
at the hobby clubs , over 3@@ 2,000 children and young people are involved in the activities of about 2,000 different work@@ groups .

the system of school catering for special interests is currently undergoing major ch@@ an ­ G@@ ES , particularly as far as the responsibility for such schools is concerned .
this has led to new problems in terms of finance , since the local self ­ governing bodies do not have suff@@ i ­ cient resources at their disposal .
the general economic situation of the country is such that there is a lack of advanced technology and other resources .
despite the problems , central and local government are doing their best to avoid a situation where children have to pay the full costs involved in pursuing their interests .
with the exception of the materials which the children themselves must provide , most workshops are currently free of charge for participating children .
training of youth workers The youth and sports department of the Culture and Education Ministry is working on training strategies for youth workers .
in ­ service training programmes , leading to a professional qualification , are currently in progress for 30 persons already engaged in youth work .
efforts are now being focused on identifying the principles for local structures and build ­ ing up an information transmission system .
the main problem , however , is the lack of com ­ pu@@ ter hardware , as such a system requires at least 20 AT computers with printers and mo@@ dem@@ s .
we do , however have the personnel required , with training in psychology , test experience and a certain amount of expertise .

information about scientific and technical cooperation
following the collapse of the totalitarian system in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc in general , Georgia embarked on a path of independent and democratic de@@ ve ­ lo@@ pment .
Moscow 's well ­ known imperial policy towards the republics forming the Soviet Union meant that contacts with Western countries were extremely limited .
until 1988 , permission to visit capitalist countries was granted only to research workers and lec@@ turers ( 13 Places ) , students on placement ( 10 ­ 12 places ) and persons taking langu@@ a ­ ge courses ( 11 ­ 13 places ) .
places in socialist countries were available for upgrading schemes ( 10 ­ 12 ) , study placements ( 5 ­ 6 ) and language courses ( 6 ­ 7 ) .
there were only two ways of being sent to a developing country , either one went as a lecturer or as an under@@ graduate on a 10 ­ month practical assignment .
it should be pointed out that four ­ year scholarships were only available in socialist countries for a total of 7 to 8 persons .
taking the entire education system , on average there were never more than 55 ­ 65 persons travelling abroad each year throughout the eigh@@ ties .
in 1989 ­ 1990 , 10 secondary school pupils went to the US , followed by 11 in 1990 ­ 1991 .
another form of cooperation can be seen in the agreements between the universities and colleges .
the Georgian Technical University has agreements with Great Britain ( South Bank Polytechnic , London , 16 people ) and Germany ( Kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he Technical University , 32 people ) . .
the Ministry of Education has arranged exchange programmes for several Tbilisi schools which do not involve any hard currency expenses .

youth exchange in Hungary by Gab@@ or Rac@@ z , Prime Minister 's Office , Youth Coordination Bureau
due to both the relatively small geographical size and the linguistic isolation of Hungary , the motivation for its people to travel abroad in order to develop international relations is much stronger than in other countries .
the period follow ­ ing the signing of the Helsinki Final Act was marked by the creation of an atmosphere that facilitated the establishing of foreign relations .
furthermore there was a positive reaction to the Hungarian efforts .
international youth exchanges were already being undertaken in 1980 ( with Austria and Finland ) and by 1982 had been extended to Italy , Germany and France .
( only political youth organizations organized exchanges with these countries . ) • The aim of the exchanges was primarily language learning ­ both language practice and vocational ­ cultural learning .
thus all the political obstacles concerning youth exchanges were demolished .
this influenced the volume of exchanges , the support system , the aims and technical conditions .
in 1990 Hungary abolished visa obligations for citizens of all European countries ( with the exception of Albania and Turkey ) .
this also had a big impact on the exchanges .
we are currently moving toward full conver@@ tibility of the Hungarian national currency , which would mean the demol@@ ition of another obstacle .
youth policy situations in Europe
• The exchanges are taking place with more and more countries .
it is pleasing to note that the number of youth exchanges with non ­ European countries ( eg .
Israel and South Korea ) has also increased .
• We consider it to be of primary importance that in the ex ­ " Eastern bloc " countries , governmental bodies to deal with youth have been established .
their activities have enabled the establishment of agreement relationships ( for example , with Poland and the Ukraine ) and the preparation of such agreements ( with Romania , the Czech and the Slovak Repub@@ lics ) .
as a result of which we currently organize exchanges with approximately 5,000 participants from these countries .
this increase in volume , combined with the changes in political conditions , has altered the aims of the exchanges and many obstacles in the way of technical and professional co ­ operation , such as the Coc@@ om list , have been abolished .
due to the plur@@ ality of the youth structure most of the Hungarian partners come from youth organizations and associations rather than from schools .
many more multilateral exchanges have been developed which were almost non ­ existent in the past .
however , we give special attention to youth organizations ' relationships , nationalities , the handicapped and state ­ care children .
further perspectives The government of the Hungarian Republic will , within the limits of its resources , make every effort to broaden and strengthen youth exchanges .
according to our plans we would like to intensify this kind of relationship with countries where we have a low number or no exchanges at all ( Norway , Estonia , Sweden , Italy , Spain etc . ) .
our aim is also that more and more multilateral youth projects be realized alongside the bilateral cooperation .
we sincerely hope that our young people will be given the opportunity to join the youth ­ related projects of the EC ( CO@@ ME@@ T@@ T , Pe@@ tra etc . ) .
we are convinced that the elaboration of the Youth Mob@@ ility Convention proposed for the 4th Conference of the Youth Ministers of the European Commission would help toward the realization of these aims .

youth exchange structures in Italy by Ram@@ on Mag@@ i , Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Youth for Europe Office
the prime consideration in youth exchange in the social and cultural fields is " mobility , " the crucial element of cultural exchange among young people today .
the main initi@@ ators of international youth exchanges in our country are local youth associations , with coordination and financing being the responsibility of local authorities ( regions , provinces and municipalities ) .
national youth associations also play a prominent role .
in this case coordination and direct control are the responsibility of the foreign ministry .
Russia is the only former Soviet rep@@ u ­ B@@ lic so far to have recognized the validity of the accord .
the purpose of these exchange programmes is , as it always has been , to foster familiarity with different cultures with a view to promoting greater mutual respect and tolerance in relations between young people on our continent .
all these schemes are designed to help solve the major social problems facing young people in the relevant age group ( between the ages of 15 and 28 ) .
those young people could then organize international encounters and exchange program ­ mes with unlimited mobility on their own initiative .
one only needs to recall that a very large number of the exchange programmes included in the protocols have become a practical reality .
of course to a large extent we owe much of this to the cooperative attitude taken by the authorities in the countries concerned .
they are right to regard youth policy as a major component of any successful programme to stabilize society .
special consideration should be given to the fact that association structures and vol@@ un ­ te@@ er work are not very well developed in Eastern Europe .
youth policy situations in Europe
therefore , in the main , our activities are geared toward objectives having clear social relevance .
the attainment of these objectives results from suitable activities being sponsored by voluntary organizations .
in this connection , it is worthwhile mentioning our recent su@@ c c@@ ess in establishing flexible structures in this area , in a number of countries with whom we are working on the basis of bilateral protocols .
we are supporting all these efforts as they create the conditions for independent activities in this field in the countries concerned .
the ultimate purpose is to establish values among the young people involved , such as social solidarity and mutual respect , values which guide the aforementioned organizations in their work .
the meeting will bring together experts and young delegates from Italy , Austria , Roma nia , Hungary , Bulgaria and Albania .
the knock @@@ -@@ @ on effect , which we believe the meeting will produce in terms of improving the situation of youth , should serve as a positive point of reference for similar initiatives in the same field and with the same priorities .
in 1992 , we took the interesting initiative of setting up an exchange with the former Soviet Union .
the exchange covers a wide range of fields , from purely social projects to the environment and programmes designed to improve familiarity on both sides by means of cultural projects .
the funds made available for such initiatives were completely used up in 1992 , a sign of how sensitive young people in the former Soviet Union are to youth problems .
the projects geared to the principles of social solidarity were particularly fruitful .
you will see from what I have said in the above , that in overall terms , we can take an optimistic view of our youth relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
the economic and financial difficulties did not prove a major obstacle to the develop ment of our exchange work .
we intend to continue our efforts , reviewing the projects as we proceed .

youth policy situations in Europe
the period since Latvia regained independence has been both difficult and interesting .
modes of production and forms of government are changing .
the generation that now constitutes the active work force was brought up under the totalitarian regime .
this necessarily influences the implementation of democratic reforms , and implies some educational work is required to promote democratic ideas and actions .
although the economy is in a transitional period , and the financial situation is difficult , one must nonetheless create prop@@ itious conditions for young people 's development : they are , after all , society 's future .
there are 2.@@ 65 million inhabitants in total ; 35 % of whom are 24 years old and younger .
only a year ago , this figure was 3@@ 5.5 % .
the proportion of children and adolescents in the total popul@@ ati ­ on is thus decreasing .
the family structure and the social conditions within families are also undergoing change .
children and adolescents are nonetheless expected to play an increasingly important political , social and economic role in the Republic of Latvia .
what are the crucial aspects of young people 's situation under these circumstances ?
second ; there is no legislation which expands the state 's sphere of influence and protection as regards children and adolescents .
there are further problems whose impact in the future may depend on the successful solution of those already mentioned .
let us first examine the opportunities for broadening educational opportunities in Latvia .
education is given in the official language , Latvian , and 15 other languages .
the economic and financial conditions mentioned above are partially to blame for this , as is the rather unclear future orientation of government policy at both national and municipal level .
as a result , the number of unemployed young people is growing .
there are 4,@@ 6@@ 92 , or 2.@@ 53 % , unemployed between the ages of 18 and 25 .
9@@ 20 registered unemployed persons are legally minors , between the ages of 15 and 18 .
according to predictions for the current year , 2,@@ 800 or 18 % of all primary school leav@@ ers will not study further .
but little thought is given to the question what is to become of them .
the Ministry of Education has some plans for opening additional commercial classes and house@@ keeping groups .
the greater emphasis recently on the role of self ­ administration in addressing youth pro ­ blems appears to@@ . offer some hope .
the creation of self ­ administered youth organizations could also help to solve the problems of drug addiction , crime and alcoholism that result from unemployment .

last year , half of the cases which the drug care centres reported concerned persons neither working nor studying .
one third of juvenile law @@@ -@@ @ break@@ ers were neither employed nor in school .
how can we make our lives ful@@ ler ?
first and foremost , we must ourselves learn and then teach young people to think and act democratically and independently .
if we do not do so we may endanger our newly won freedom .
how can this learning and teaching be done more quickly and effectively ?
developing concepts in conjunction with those countries which have a longer experience of democracy are a welcome beginning .
some steps have already been taken in this direction .
we are collaborating with the American @@@ -@@ @ Latvian Association in the organization of a Centre for Democratic Development in our country .
this is aimed at democratic education both in the schools and in educational programmes outside of school .
furthermore , the core of the proposed cooperation with the Latvia @@@ -@@ @ Denmark Association deals with learning the basics of democracy through working with pupils ' councils .
this includes exchanging ideas on working with those who have difficulty becoming integrated in their social surroundings .
the partner in drafting this cooperation is the association of Head Te@@ achers in Denmark .
the cooperation programme , which is approved and supported by the Ministry of Education , is operative in other areas as well , both at the level of national government and at the level of individual educational institutions and individual persons .
we are happy to accept any plan for cooperation in all fields related to the development of young people .
this also applies to the areas of leisure activity or extrac@@ ur@@ ricul@@ ar education .
at present , programmes for gifted children are particularly being developed .
it is to be hoped that this extrac@@ ur@@ ricul@@ ar educational system will survive the difficult financial situation , because a solution to the problem of leisure time simultaneously advances the intellectual potential of the population .
for the time being participation in interesting , enriching events abroad , and probably traditional forms of action at home , should be put temporarily aside .
this is a tremendous opportunity for the development of shared interests and organized leisure activities .
it is a type of school where young people can express and discuss their views on the Objec@@ tives of society , or on certain groups within it .
it is a place where they can realize their own ambitions , where they can learn leadership .
the organized youth movement in Latvia comprises few members - slightly over 10,000 - but over 20 organizations , of which 16 have been admitted to the Youth Council founded six months ago .
youth policy situations in Europe
it may be asked why membership is as low as 10,000 ?
the answer probably lies in the apathy which carried over from the days of the mandatory Pi@@ one@@ er and Komsom@@ ol organizations .
yet we are moving in our own new direction , where the process of forming an organization is allowed to develop without pressure , so that it may be thoroughly understood and accepted by society .
the youth movement was well developed as early as the 1930 's ; thus many organizations need only to be renewed , or to be re@@ mod@@ elled , after organizations in other parts of the world .
sc@@ outs , Gu@@ ides and the Y@@ M@@ CA / Y@@ W@@ CA are just some of these .
the Children 's School of the Environment , the Latvian Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Youth , the Riga Environmental Protection Club and many other groups are active as well .
many of these organizations work in close cooperation with organizations abroad .
they have youth delegation exchanges and carry out educational programmes .
the Y@@ M@@ CA / Y@@ W@@ CA has also joined the worldwide federation .
further exchange and educational projects have been realized thanks to the Sweden @@@ -@@ @ Latvia Association and the European Alliance of Christian Youth Associations .
amongst our active partners in Sweden is the association " For a Life Free of Alco@@ hol@@ ism and Drug Ad@@ diction . "
cooperation in this case consists of organizing programmes , both in Sweden and in Latvia , and creating opportunities for travel .
for example , a return ticket to Berlin would cost the average worker six months ' wages .
the development of the youth hostel movement would be very beneficial in this respect given that many young people travel mainly on foot or by bicycle .
obviously , such difficulties are equally prohib@@ itive for other kinds of youth exchange .
governmental agencies sometimes offer neither financial support nor sympathy .

various public organizations have been established , along with communities , clubs , study centres and leagues .
these organizations , on the basis of pre @@@ -@@ @ war school and public life experiences , take the names of eminent Lithuanian historical figures ( M@@ air@@ onians , Ge@@ dimin@@ ians , M@@ ind@@ au@@ gan@@ ians etc . ) .
these alternative youth centres do not defend traditional national values , rather they base their work on those of the late 20th century .
Lithuanian youth activity primarily takes the form of participation in artistic life , music groups , sports and tourism clubs . approximately 10 % of schoolchildren take part in art circles , sport teams and other clubs .
help for youth , facing its various problems , comes from the ministries responsible for social , cultural and educational affairs .
the activities of youth organizations are coordinated by the Ministry of Culture and Education through its Youth and Cultural Centres Department .
the Youth Experts Committee under the Ministry of Culture and Education is responsible for youth problems and for seeking various alternative forms of activity .

as a small country in the heart of Europe , Luxem@@ burg has always sought to promote good relations with its neighbours .
Luxem@@ burg has been welcoming immigrants for over a hundred years .
intensive regional border traffic has led to a wide range of relations with Belgium , the Federal Republic of Germany and France .
immigration from Italy , Spain and especially Portugal has been the main reason for the development of active relations with these countries .
in the opposite direction , many young Luxem@@ bur@@ gers leave each year to take up studies in neighbouring countries and also in other European states and overseas .
these factors have led to many different forms of bilateral relations with European countries .
there are currently bilateral agreements including the field of youth exchange with Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , France , Germany , Great Britain , Hungary , Italy , the Ne@@ ther ­ lands , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Russia , Slovakia and Spain .
relations have been particularly intensive with our Ben@@ el@@ ux partners and the EC states .
the Youth for Europe programme plays a maj@@ or@@ .@@ role here .
the youth exchange platform established in 1985 is a new form of youth exchange co ­ operation for Luxem@@ burg .
it org@@ inates from the cooperation developed between the county of Kent in Great Britain , and Luxem@@ burg as part of the International Year of Youth .
to date meetings have been held in Luxem@@ burg , Liechtenstein , San Marino , Vor@@ ar@@ l@@ berg , Kent and Finland .
it is planned to hold the 1994 meeting in Hungary .
a special meeting is planned to take place at the European Youth Centre in Stras@@ burg to mark the platform 's tenth anniversary in 1995 .
the main youth exchange instruments used by Luxem@@ burg are : • cooperation in the border regions • bilateral agreements • the youth exchange platform • the Youth for Europe programme
this agency is run on a joint basis with the Service National de la Je@@ un@@ esse and the National Youth Information and Exchange Service .

contacts with Central and East European countries are based on the bilateral agree ments , previously referred to , with Bulgaria , Russia , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Poland , Romania and Hungary .
the contacts established by the youth exchange platform also play an important part .
you may be interested to hear that government representatives of the three Ben@@ el@@ ux countries recently agreed to work closer together , particularly with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
there are plans , for example , to organize training programmes for youth workers for Romania in Stras@@ burg , Luxem@@ burg and Brussels in cooperation with the Youth Centre of the Council of Europe .
nothing has been said so far about the activities of the actual youth organizations .
traditional youth organizations , like the S@@ cou@@ ts and Gu@@ ides , have long @@@ -@@ @ standing international contacts .
the umbrella organization of Luxem@@ burg 's youth associations , the Conference Gener@@ ale de la Je@@ un@@ esse Luxem@@ bourgeo@@ ise , is planning to increase its cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe as a joint effort with its partner organizations in the other Ben@@ el@@ ux countries .
a meeting has been scheduled for next year to review the state of progress on youth exchanges with Central and Eastern Europe .
Luxem@@ burg will be lobbying through the European Community and the Council of Europe for a youth policy taking in Western , Southern , Central and Eastern Europe so as to make a contribution to peaceful development in Europe .

youth is a force capable of determining the form and nature of changes in a democratic society .
the decline in spiritual and cultural values , social apathy and passi@@ vity among youth , are the result of the hypo@@ critical , formal attitude taken by the totalitarian system towards the problems , interests and needs of youth .
young people between the ages of 16 and 30 make up over 21 % of the population in the Republic of Mold@@ avia and are the social strat@@ um which will , to a large extent , determine the future of the fle@@ dg@@ ling state .
• The problem of youth unemployment . • Material and social difficulties experienced by young families . • Im@@ proving the legislative foundations of youth policy . • Draft Youth Act prepared .
in August 1991 , the government of the Republic of Mold@@ avia approved the Strategy for Official Youth Policy .
the establishment of an inter@@ departmental Youth Affairs Committee under the auspices of the Ministry of Youth , Sport and Tourism has been proposed .
contacts with youth in Europe and other continents have been established and are now being developed .
a number of international events have been organized in the past two years .
in May ­ June 1992 , K@@ ish@@ in@@ y@@ ov was the venue for a European forum of governmental and non ­ governmental organizations devoted to the soci@@ opol@@ itical situation in Europe and the prospects for cooperation among Youth .
agreements and protocols on cooperation have been signed with Romania , the Ukraine and China .
agreement has been reached on the signing of similar documents with Bulgaria , Turkey , Russia , France , Belarus and India .
East ­ West exchange is a factor promoting stabilization in Europe , peace in the Balkans and efforts to prevent the escalation of conflicts .
this can be achieved through participation in the implementation of joint youth programmes and support for East ­ West youth ex@@ e@@ han@@ ges .
as a consequence , the implementation of welfare services remained the domain of autonomous non ­ governmental organizations ( NGO 's ) , originally closely linked to different religious and ideological pillars in Dutch society .
parallel to this , a transformation of the traditional welfare organizations to fully profession@@ a ­ li@@ zed institutions took place , and with it , the growth of educational institutions for the training of professional social workers .
in social work practice , a process of differentiation created all kinds of specialized services , ( sub ) disciplines and institutions .
this development did not occur as a controlled , policy ­ based process .
basically , there was no specific plan implemented for the development of the social welfare system .
the expansion was entrusted to the " market mechanisms " of the supply of welfare services offered by private welfare institutions , and the demand for help , care and support by private citizens .
the national government financed this development through a complex system of subsidies , hon@@ ouring the initiatives of the private welfare institutions .
even today , the majority of our ' public ' welfare services are provided by these private organizations .
in most cases , the ideological identity has diminished as a result of secul@@ ar@@ iz@@ a ­ tion and profession@@ alization .
the main source of finance for these services is now from local governments .
owing to the independent legal status of the welfare institutions , the local governments can exercise only limited control .
for the development of a welfare policy , the local administrations are mainly dependent on the cooperation of welfare institutions .
this concept conflic@@ ted with the ' free market ' of welfare services supported by private professional welfare organizations which consider these services as being un@@ suitable subjects for coherent and controlled policy planning .
the central government decided to ration@@ alize the social welfare system .
however , since the mid ­ sev@@ enti@@ es the concept of the ' caring state ' increasingly became a topic of critical scrutiny .
the caring state was dis@@ enc@@ ou ­ raging their primary caring initiatives and roles as private citizens and their associations .
youth policy situations in Europe
the main role of the Department of Welfare was re@@ defined as ' pro@@ pel ­ ling innovation ' in the field of welfare services and welfare policies .
the decentralization of youth policy to local and regional authorities did not , however , automatically provide the conditions necessary for the development of such policies .
this in turn impeded the development of a policy framework and long term policy plan ­ ning .
analysis of the need for youth services in the local society was traditionally entrusted to the individual welfare institutions and their professionals , as were the content and the quality of these services .
consequently , in most municipalities , youth policy was completely dependent on the expertise of the autonomous local welfare institutions .
these institutions were the inter@@ me ­ di@@ aries between the needs of the population and local government .
the policy of the local welfare departments was generally to follow the initiatives taken by the institutions , provi@@ d ­ ing for them to the extent the budgets permitted .
the situation has , however , increasingly become an object of doubt and criticism . the main reasons being as follows :
• generally speaking , profession@@ alization tends to reduce the contribution of users and volunteers .
the ' voice ' of the client / user is replaced by professional analysis of the client ­ situation and his needs .
the institutional setting of services in many cases reduced their ' target group ' to the people who actually used the facilities .
youth policy situations in Europe
the necessity for cooperation between local youth welfare services and facilities , and between the different local policy departments , is emphasized , as is the need for youth participation .
professional cooperation at that level seemed to reach beyond the more narrow interests of the individual institutions .
successful experiences in this realm proved to have a positive effect on the willingness to consider further co operation at an institutional level .
the research findings promote a model where@@ in local NGO 's are invited or encouraged to subscribe to programmes designed within the local government 's area of responsibility .
this model is called : ' programme @@@ -@@ @ based Local Youth Policy ' .
a main condition for the implementation of programme @@@ -@@ @ based youth policy is that the local government should ac@@ know@@ leg@@ de its political and actual responsibility for local policy development and its implementation .
a main characteristic of programme @@@ -@@ @ based local youth policy is that it re @@@ -@@ @ establishes the responsibility of the local government , and through this it re@@ defines the blurred relations between NGO 's and the@@ . local government .
youth policy situations in Europe
this development of semi ­ market regulated relations between local government and wel ­ fare ­ NGO 's is already manif@@ esting itself through recent local welfare policy developments .
this often creates the need for crystal ­ clear contracts and more control over the agreements .
in most cases , however , these developments are not driven by the urge to develop a more coherent local welfare policy .
it is more a consequence of the incremental tradition of finding pragmatic solutions to distinct problems , such as the necessity to cut back local government spending and the demands for services by the local population .
in the cities , many institutions , organizations and agencies for health care and welfare services are available for young people with specific socio ­ psych@@ olo ­ g@@ ical problems .
to cope with this problem a computer@@ ized registration system ( GR@@ IP ) has been devel@@ o ­ PE@@ D by the local health service of the city of Amsterdam .
a collective database is set up between several services that deal with comparable problems and target ­ groups .
every new client of each of these services is registered in the database according to identical criteria .
the datab@@ a ­ se can be consulted to screen whether the client is under treatment elsewhere , and what programme or therapy has been advised or applied .
if necessary the services can consult each other as regards the best next step to be taken .

this system ( G@@ ES ) will eventually operate in connection with GR@@ IP and is developed according to the principles of ' neural networks ' .
this scheme is now being implemented in several Dutch cities .
according to statistics published by the National Statistics Centre on 1 July 1990 , children and young people in Romania can be divided into the following age categories :
total
with regard to the psychological state of young Roman@@ ians , studies carried out by the Youth Research Centre and the National polls Institute show that , generally speaking , there is a widely felt need for support from society .
what they mention most frequently are more reasonable prices , and guaranteed jobs and housing ; they also express a lack of confidence in the government 's ability to solve these problems .
two thirds of young people have no wish to emigr@@ ate , and those who do have no in@@ ten ­ tion of leaving for good , but only for a few years .
youth associations , legal and institutional framework 1 .
youth associations After 1989 young Roman@@ ians were quick to form associations to defend their rights and to organize vocational and leisure activities specific to young people .
after an initial burst of association ­ forming in 1990 ( over 600 ) , there are now only about 200 , representing about 2 % of young people .
they can be divided into the following categories : a ) Non ­ political organizations : • cultural and sports • humanitarian • ethnic • religious • school ( clubs for teenagers )
the central administrative body dealing with the representation of young people at government level is the Ministry for Youth and Sports .
these are specialist bodies of local government and are under the a@@ eg@@ is of the Ministry for Youth and Sports .
in addition to this governmental framework , in each Romanian region there is a Youth Foundation .
this is a public , nongovernmental institution , specially created in 1990 in order to administer the property of ex @@@ -@@ @ communist regional youth organizations .
the aims of the youth policy pursued by the Ministry for Youth and Sports - Youth Department In the present circumstances of transition , young people are particularly susceptible to frustration and social margin@@ alization .
through its Youth Department , the government proposes the following aims :
equally that law will define the relationship between the Ministry for Youth and Sports and association structures as that of a partnership , ruling out any kind of sub@@ ordination of the association structures .
in this context , amendments must be made to Decree @@@ -@@ @ Law 150 / 1990 which defines the statutes for the organization and operation of youth foundations .

the situation of youth in Russia At the beginning of 1990 there were 3@@ 3.3 million people between the ages of 14 and 29 living in Russia .
in 1992 the proportion of people above working age in the regions of the Russian Federation was higher than the number below .
between 1987 and 1992 there was a decline in the number of births by 7@@ 00,000 , or 28 % , making a total of 1.8 million new ­ born children last year .
the number of marriages per 100 people fell from 9.@@ 7 in 1985 to 8.@@ 9 in 1990 .
young couples who have been together for less than five years account for a third of all divor@@ ces .
this has a lot to do with the deterioration of the material and general situation of young people .
the standard of education among young people is considerably higher than that of other groups .
8.4 % have a higher education , 2@@ 6.3 % an incomplete higher or specialized secondary education , and 4@@ 6.5 % have a secondary education , whilst 17.@@ 5 % failed to complete their secondary education .
however , the quality of education sur@@ passes the current level of requirements .
this can be seen in a number of ways , firstly in the limited opportunities , and secondly through the disparity between the education young people have received and the nature and content of their work .
over half of all young factory workers and professionals have jobs which do not reflect their educational standard .
society is failing to make full use of the abilities of most young people .
the new prices and incomes in 1992 were accompanied by a growth in the number of young people living below the poverty line .
it is a uniquely Russian phenomenon that virtually all young people are financially dependent on their parents .
1991 and 1992 witnessed a major exacerb@@ ation of the most serious problem facing young people ­ that of housing .
experts calculated that in the summer of 1992 there were about 3 million young men and women who were neither in education nor employment .
this figure may now have doubled because of school and college ­ leav@@ ers , a decline in the number of jobs available and the demobil@@ ization of military personnel .
the conditions are ripe for the emergence of large marginal groups since youn@@ gsters are more likely than other age groups to lose what are already rather weak functional links with society .
a particular cause for concern is the mounting crime among the younger generation and their mass involvement in illegal activities .
young people 's position in the power structure is such that their involvement in the administration of society and production activities is often limited to a merely formal role .
a loss of conf@@ i ­ dence is apparent among youth towards all authorities and public structures .
youth policy situations in Europe
there has been a fundamental change in the situation of the youth and children 's move ment .
at the end of 1992 there were 55 children 's and youth organizations registered with the authorities and established throughout Russia or in several regions , and over 150 active on a regional scale .
it is important that the various associations should cooperate with each other and seek to promote mutual understanding amongst themselves and with the authorities .
this was the reason for the establishment in January 1992 of the Russian National Council of Youth Associations set up along similar lines to the national councils and nationwide youth organizations in other countries .
such organizations not only represent the interests of the country 's young people vis @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ vis parliament and government , but also receive assistance , usually financial , from the state .
official youth affairs organizations The Youth Affairs Committee of the Russian Federation was established in September 1992 by a directive of the Russian President .
it was set up in response to the need for an integrated approach to youth policy in Russia .
the Committee is a central body enjoying federal executive power , carrying out government regulation and coordination between the various aspects of youth policy in the Russian Federation .
there are 68 youth affairs ministries , committees and departments forming part of the government in the Russian republic , the area administrations and the regions .
financial assistance was granted to 75 Russian territories to the tune of over 9@@ 50 million roubles and places were provided for refugee children who had fled from regions ridden with conflicts .
the Government of the Russian Federation has prepared a decree on the organization of the summer recreation programme in 1993 , and work is proceeding on the reorganization of the Or@@ ly@@ on@@ ok and O@@ ke@@ an national children 's holiday centres .
youth policy situations in Europe
• As far as cooperation with child and youth organizations is concerned , contacts have been established with all major associations of this type which are active throughout Russia .
together with the relevant committee of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet , youth and children 's organizations work is in progress on drafting legislation on children 's and youth organizations in Russia .
problems and difficulties One of the main problems in putting official youth policy into practice is the lack of under standing it encounters from numerous leaders at all levels .
this leads to an over@@ simplification of youth policy , through reducing it to a spending , distributive function ( i.e. the politics of poverty and pat@@ ern@@ alism ) , though in reality it is quite different .
all youth policy in Russia is aimed at developing the innovative powers which will help young people become self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient and discover for themselves new areas of productive and creative activity .
in other words , the purpose is definitely not to put them in a position where , being " forever young , " they are entirely dependent on the parents and the " generosity " of the state .
international cooperation The development of international youth cooperation is one of the primary concerns of the Russian Federation Committee on Youth Affairs .
furthermore , on a broader level , cooperation is required to facilitate Russia 's integration into European youth structures , its involvement in key programmes in the field and the development of a single European " youth area . "
reports · facts · opinions
the committee sees the following paths for international cooperation : • First , the development of bilateral cooperation based on existing government youth exchange agreements and those in the pipeline .
these theses are intended to provide information in order to give participants an idea of the actual youth situation in Russia , and their problems and difficulties at the present time .
we feel that these will help all participants to carry on a more fruitful dialogue aimed at closer cooperation and mutual understanding .
youth policy situations in Europe
at its meeting held on January 7 , 1992 , the government of the Slovak Republic reviewed and approved the document " The Principles of State Policies in Rel@@ ation to Youth in the Slovak Republic . "
enclosed in this document is an additional document called " Program@@ mes of Protection and Support for the Youth in the Slovak Republic . "
equally important , and even more dramatic , were the passages of the " Principles " which dealt with clari@@ fying the relationship between the state and the youth associations .
the point is that a revision of traditional state pat@@ ern@@ alism is currently taking place and the principles of subsidi@@ arity are beginning to be applied to relations be ­ t@@ ween the state and youth .
this fundamental process , which deserves widespread support , is dependent , for its su@@ c ­ cess@@ ful application , on how many young people from the various associations are re@@ pres@@ en ­ T@@ ed by the Slovak Youth Council .
a great number of youth associations will face immense difficulties in sur@@ mounting psychological barriers stemming from young people 's resistance to join any organization whatsoever .
youth work in a particular district , or in any community or town , becomes an important part of the social infrastructure .

programmes for youth protection and promotion in the Slovak Republic in 1993 will be implemented by means of purpose ­ directed projects .
these projects are t@@ ö be implemented b@@ x civic associations , and societies oriented toward the younger generation , notably child and youth organizations .
in this way the programmes '@@ can demonstrate how to generate incentives for setting up a social network which is specifically designed for the young gene ­ ration .
this network may help to strengthen the links with other existing programmes , both domestic and international .
the list of programmes for the year 1993 has been divided into five basic groups :
e Citi@@ zen 's participation promotion programmes • Promo@@ ting the preparation of professional and voluntary child and youth leaders
these programmes are funded out of the Slovak Republic 's state budget , from the portion allocated to youth care .

status of youth in the Ukraine by Dr@@ s. Alexander Ya@@ rem@@ enko , Director of the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute for Youth Problems
for example , the average wage of a young worker amounts to only 60 per cent of the aver ­ age Ukrainian standard , and is two times less than a minimum youth consumer 's budget .
on the one hand it may appear to be quite objective if we take into account their low qu@@ ali ­ fication level , and their insufficient professional and social experience .
at the same time , however , the possibilities for them to develop this experience , to satisfy their vital interests and requirements , which are necessary in order to support a family , do not exist .
it makes young citizens regard social ­ economic changes taking place in the society with great sc@@ ept@@ i ­ c@@ ism , criticism and irony .
when there is no real mechanism for the state to support its youth , a constant decline in living standards of the young people occurs , which is reflected through the level of their self ­ appraisal .
only 39 per cent of the poll 's participants have stated that their economic conditions have not changed for the last year .
48 per cent of respondents consider that their economic and financial conditions have become considerably worse .
thus , as for hopes for a better future , 4@@ 0.9 per cent of the young people que ­ sti@@ oned answered that they have no grounds to expect their living conditions to improve .
specialists with higher education who work in production ( 49 per cent ) are the most afraid of becoming unemployed .
the situation in the Ukraine in terms of family and mat@@ ri@@ mony is very difficult .
as a result , in 1992 the population decreased by 70 thousand , as the number of deceased exceeded the number of children born .
this tendency has been observed over three consecutive years .
the age for people mar@@ rying has also decreased ( the average age for women is 20.@@ 5 years old and for men , 2@@ 2.9 years ) .
at the same time there is a constant increase in the divorce rate , about 40 per cent of divor@@ ces occur@@ ing amongst couples married for less than five years .
all this does not favour child ­ bearing and will lead to a future deficiency in labour resources , which will be also aggravated by a con ­ si@@ der@@ able number of people reaching retirement age .
the number of children born to un@@ married mothers ( aged below 30 ) is 11.@@ 8 per cent of all children born .
today , as well as during the last decades , the situation is as follows : most families are provided with accommodation and separate flats only when they reach active child ­ bearing age .
under modern conditions , especially in cities , the fact that several fam@@ i ­ lies live together in one flat more frequently becomes a source of social and psychological tension , and fav@@ ours neither stability of marriage nor an increase in the birth rate .
as before , an absolute majority of the young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E questioned ( 80 per cent ) support actions directed toward the building up of an inde@@ pen ­ dent Ukrainian State .
however , under conditions of economic destabilization , gal@@ lo@@ ping inflation and further impover@@ ishment of a considerable part of the population , the political problems in the orient@@ ations of young people are being forced into the background .
it should be added that the young people of the Ukraine ( especially students ) have already had experience in organizing and conducting different types of actions of protest and actions of civic disobedience .
in this respect the attitude of the youth of the Ukraine towards different means of political struggle is of considerable importance .
results of research show that a positive attitude towards different forms of political struggle rests primarily with the more highly educated students and workers .
during the last few years a lot of different public unions have appeared in the Ukraine , including youth and children 's organizations .
however , the status of these organizations and their material and financial resources are still insufficient .
without some assistance and support on the part of the state and its structures , such organizations will as a rule become " debtors " of adults ' organizations , which use them for their political purposes , or they will dissolve .
the crime rate among youth and minors has increased by 12 per cent over the last ten years , and in 1992 by 4.7 per cent over 1991 .
80 per cent of drug addicts are young people , of which 40 per cent are minors .
more than 25,000 young people take part in serious crimes annually .
the crime rate among girls has increased 2.5 times since 1980 .
young people 's considerable loss of interest in reading , art and culture as a whole , gives rise to a serious concern .
this fact can be explained not only by the increase of purely " financial " interest , i.e. , the desire to accumulate money .
the cultural infrastructure which had been created in the Ukraine over many decades is gradually being crushed .
the number of regular visits to cu@@ l ­ Tur@@ al institutions , sports and recreational facilities has declined by between 5 ­ 10 % .
the cost of renting premises for cultural requirements and leisure of the citizens has considerably increased .
at the same time , there are no communal facilities for the spiritual development of youth in many urban areas , and especially not in villages .
the cultural services offered to the population in the new district of the regional centres and cities leaves much to be desired .
but the analysis of statistical data and results of research allow a number of general conclusions to be drawn , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be dis@@ regarded .
firstly , the consequences of society 's spiritual and economic crisis for the students are complicated and contradictory .
the level of criticism and non ­ compliance with the events and the acts of the authorities , which previously took place in the Ukraine , the countries ó@@ f the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , remains quite high .
at the same time , representatives from this youth sub@@ group show an increasing interest in emigration , a desire to live , study and work abroad .
4@@ 2.3 per cent of the students ques@@ ti@@ o ­ N@@ ed replied that if they had the slightest opportunity they would leave the country .
the majority of students ( 70 per cent ) do not consider military service , even in the national guard , to be their civic duty .
among students there are many who are in a state of perpl@@ ex@@ ity and experiencing a loss of social orientation .
thirdly , together with a considerable increase in pragmatic tendencies amongst student youth , such values as professionalism , and the notion of honest and conscienti@@ ous labour are becoming lost .
under the influence of many social ­ economic and other factors , the value orient@@ ations of students are considerably changing from being all ­ humane to more mercanti@@ le and Pr@@ ag@@ ma ­ tic .

youth Exchange Centre a ) The Youth Exchange Centre ( Y@@ EC ) is a department of the British Council .
what is youth exchange ?
a youth exchange takes place between a group of young people from one country and a similar group from another @@@ -@@ @ country .
a group of young people visit their partner group for a period of 10 to 15 days and then host them when they come to visit .
where possible , the same young people are involved in both legs of the exchange .
by taking part in a youth exchange , young people can experience the way of life and culture of another country at first hand .
they can see for themselves what it is like to be a young person in that country .
an exchange stresses social contact and targets a common interest or theme .
exchanges aim to promote international friendship and understanding and to help the personal , social and cultural growth of those taking part .

and C@@ AN@@ NOT be done ?
some activities are not eligible for grants .
their main aim was to open up youth exchange to all interested young people , and visa fees were wai@@ ved on the basis of reciproc@@ ity .
certain barriers , such as visa problems in the case of some countries , which previously greatly restricted the practical application of youth exchange agreements no longer exist .
most important , however , has been the Rem@@ o ­ Val of the political obstacle which imposed limitations on the freedom to travel .
as a result the opportunity to become involved in youth encounters is open to all .
at present it is not always possible to sur@@ mount these barriers , and even when they are sur@@ mounted it is only possible at the cost of major sacrifice on the part of most participants .

• The Federal Ministry for Women and Youth receives a large @@@ -@@ @ number of en@@ qui@@ ries from people interested in acquain@@ ting themselves with youth policy and the youth welfare system in Germany .
they wish to share in our experience in building up and developing a plur@@ alist , democratic youth structure and a youth welfare policy based on the principle of subsidi@@ arity .
unfortunately , however , the financial and personnel resources available do not allow us to do as much as we would like to , or enable us to fully satisfy all expectations .
a large number of specialized programmes , some for initial and further training purposes , are currently being run in cooperation with the youth associations and relevant institutions .
seminars and conferences as well as second@@ ments of various dur@@ ations form part of these programmes .
in addition to this , experts are appointed to provide advice on the ground .
such schemes have proved most successful when incorporated into existing partnerships .
this is the best way of ensuring continuity , reviewing past experiences and the broad dissemination of the most successful practices .
although the ministry does support these schemes , it is not actually responsible for their implementation .
this is the job of the relevant youth associations and institutions themselves .
exchanges of experience with the participating organizations in Germany takes the form of working meetings .
with the unification of the two German states on 3 October 1990 , Brandenburg and the other East German federal L@@ ä@@ n@@ der were faced with the challenge of restructuring themselves from top to bottom .
the centr@@ alist structures of East Germany were replaced with the federal system as practi@@ sed in West Germany , and by the principle of local self ­ administration .
much has been achieved in just over two years , but we will be faced with another major challenge this year with the re@@ organiz@@ a ­ tion of the districts .
the formation of a single , federal Land with Berlin also lies ahead of us .
in practice , apart from a small number of church ­ run youth activities , there was no such thing as a range of private agencies .
extrac@@ ur@@ ricul@@ ar activities organized by the Socialist Unity Party ( SE@@ D ) and affiliated organizations were considered as separate from youth welfare .
the new youth affairs units were established in many districts and municipalities by drawing on the staff and resources from the youth welfare / institutional care departments of the former councils .
they were given additional responsibilities and authorities , and they recruited extra staff , e.g. for youth work .
the federal Land of Brandenburg enacted legislation on the organization of youth wel ­ fare in order to lay solid foundations for practical work in the field .
this satisfied the con@@ di ­ tions required for the establishment of a Regional Youth Board , involving representatives of public bodies and private youth welfare agencies in its decision ­ making processes .
these principles can only be put into practice through a process which involves facing up to and accepting different traditions , view@@ points and structures .
but there was no time for this , so as a result the development of new youth welfare structures and new substance for youth welfare work in the broad@@ est sense remains a priority task for the years to come .
youth policy situations in Europe
this is in no small part thanks to extensive assistance from the regions and districts with whom the Land of Brandenburg has maintained partnership relations .
cooperation between the local , regional and federal levels is gradually becoming less fren@@ z@@ ied .
some objectives have already been attained while others are still to be met .
there is soon to be a local government reorganization in the federal state of Brandenburg , with the present 44 districts and municipalities being reduced to 18 .
it is expected that the larger districts will produce more efficient administrations and , hence , more efficient youth boards .
alongside the efforts at structural reform , work is underway to raise standards among youth welfare workers .
apart from the organizational challenge , grouping all these functions together in a single youth work setup called for budget dec@@ i ­ sions to ensure the provision of sufficient financial and personnel resources .
given the lim@@ i ­ T@@ ed scope for movement at the local authority level , special importance was attached to this question by the regional authorities .
funds were ear@@ marked I@@ H particular for children 's and youth recreation , extrac@@ ur@@ ricul@@ ar education , innovative models and projects , and for inter ­ national relations .
there was a massive need for the right advice and , although the readiness to break new ground was rather tentative to begin with , the chance to travel and get involved in international youth exchange programmes proved irresisti@@ ble in the end .
the funds made available at federal and regional level for international youth exchanges were split half and half between Eastern and Western countries .
we were quite aware of our special situation in Brandenburg , being mid@@ way between East and West , so to speak .
since late 1990 , for example , we have been involved in the work of the German ­ Polish Youth Foundation ­ and successfully so .
Brandenburg shares with the countries of the " East " many experiences of political development in the past .
however , they were not given a chance to develop exchanges with Western countries .
nowadays Brandenburg is an area in the " east " of a " Western " country .
having belonged until recently to that part of Europe outside the European Community , it is now becoming part and parcel of this economic and political system .
youth policy situations in Europe
encounters in the past were never really cent@@ red on the needs of the individual and more often than not made no attempt to famili@@ arize their participants with the everyday situation of their counterparts in the other country .
we would like to follow the example of those exchanges that did achieve something , and create the conditions for more rewarding opportunities of this kind .

youth policy situations in Europe
between the cultural met@@ ropolis and the divided city epo@@ ch@@ s lies a 12 year span , during which Berlin - as the capital of Fasc@@ ist Germany - was neither cosmopolitan nor attractive .
thus the opportunity for Berlin and Brandenburg to organize the conference on International Youth Exchange , together with the European Community , gives us particular pleasure .
one example of this is the high number of meetings between young Ber@@ liners and their peers from all over the world which took place in 1992 .
in that year alone , 2@@ 81 international meetings involving some 6,@@ 240 participants were organized with the support of public funds .
in addition , many meetings of young people have been organized without public financial assistance , or have been financed by Berlin bor@@ ough@@ s .
the development of exchanges between young people from Berlin and those in Eastern and Central Europe has shown that the changed circumstances in these countries has resulted in a new and different type of youth exchange .
Berlin 's unique position as a meeting point between East and West since reunification explains its particular interest in international youth exchange .
the idea of giving this speech arose when Senator Kr@@ ü@@ ger and I were discussing our own per ­ s@@ onal developments and bio@@ graphies .
our situations are comparable in a way .
I came from the West and went to the East .
before I started working for Brandenburg , I was , as under ­ secretary in West Berlin , in charge of youth work in Berlin .
we were discussing which view we should be taking as regards the changes taking place in youth exchange .
the results of this discussion were very interesting .
I would like to begin by describing the experience of youth exchange from a Western point of view .
a key term was mentioned yesterday , a term also used by Mr. L@@ aur@@ it@@ zen in his paper : ' the fortress of Europe ' .
on the one hand , a certain attraction could be seen in socialism as it existed , on the other hand one could not at all be satisfied with such state ­ organized exchange programmes .
this youth organization was clearly defined .
it was a Party domain , thus ideologically and politically defined .
the F@@ DJ was a gigantic travel organization including its own travel bureau , known as ' In@@ tourist ' .
the F@@ DJ organized camps for work and for recreation .
once , as an appren@@ tice , I took part in one of those camps myself .
it comprised working for one week and spending one week 's leisure time together with other people .
reports · facts ■ opinions
in this context , I would like to make three remarks : 1 .
youth exchange between Eastern countries was intended to be a way of confirming the separation between East and West and of recognizing its existence in the East .
whilst there , a Ukrainian , on discovering that I came from Germany , asked me : ' from Germany or from the German Soviet Republic ? '
the aim was not to learn that we were different but to confirm that we were the same .
I believe it is very important for youth exchange between East and West to realize this , i.e. , that the emphasis on ' being the same ' within one global ideological system , within soci@@ a ­ L@@ IS@@ M , played an essential role .
but of course we knew , though perhaps not fully conscious of the fact , that to be the same was only fiction .
there was a joke people were telling in the West : ' people in the Soviet Union , what are they really , friends or brothers ?
they are brothers because you can choose your friends yourself . '
but as far as I am concerned , I can state that I did have friends there .
exchanges were always officially organized and ideologically motivated .
the aim was to experience the socialist system as a force .
I believe , however , that this thesis lost force during the final years of the G@@ DR .
and they see a long queue of people in front of the Eastern Hell who could not get in , while there was not a single person waiting in front of the Western Hell .
'@@ Well , you either get tar@@ red and feather@@ ed , or you get n@@ ailed to the wall , or they put you in boiling oil . '
'@@ But why are people qu@@ eu@@ ing then to get into the Eastern Hell ? '
I believe that exchanges in the 1980 's increasingly involved opportunities for various types of criticism .
reports · facts ■ opinions
in other words , youth exchange made political erosion in the G@@ DR more dynamic .
of course , it was a special kind of youth exchange when all those young people from the former G@@ DR went West across the open border .
it marked the end of East ­ East youth exchange , but it was also its zen@@ ith .
this was a decisive difference between us .
whereas in the West the means provided for , and the support for , youth ex@@ ch@@ an ­ G@@ ES are relatively minimal .
this is , I believe , an essential difference .
let me cite an example .
prior to unification , 4@@ 50,000 youths travelled to Poland every year , participating in state ­ organized exchanges .
I am not certain whether today it is 20,000 or 25,000 youths but in any case it is a rapid decrease .
as regards development in Berlin , or even Berlin ­ Brandenburg , we are in the strange position of being both West and East .
for Germans in the Western states we are the Far East , but for colleagues from Poland , from the Czech Republic or from Russia we are parag@@ ons of the West .
so our position is turning out to be one of a lin@@ ch@@ pin .
whilst discussing youth encounters , I believe we also need to consider poverty frontiers in Europe , and the possibilities of removing them .
this also represents a political task for the EC .
reports ■ facts · opinions
field reports and Great Britain and away from Poland and Russia , and it is impossible for us to meet this interest with the means available to us .
after all , there is no use in the long run in having small groups cultivate exchange while the real interests of exchange actually follow the general direction of migration .
Thomas Kr@@ ü@@ ger I believe that youth exchange can indeed counter this development in a productive way .
I believe that the prerequisite for this is the understanding of one another and that youth exchange should not necessarily be seen as a stepping stone on the way to migration .
I regard youth exchange as a possibility of learning about , and of respecting , differences .
respecting and accepting differences can give strength and appeal to such terms as solid@@ ari ­ ty and tolerance .
I believe that constructing walls around Europe , of locking ourselves up behind these walls would inevitably create crises .
learning about a world whose status quo is not a normal one , and which has to find new paths , can be achieved through exchange programmes .
in this way understanding among young people who , of course , are also dissem@@ ina ­ tors ( youth organization bureaucrats are not the only dissemin@@ ators ) is advanced in a very direct manner .
you said the young people are to be placed at the centre .
but tell me , who are the young people ?
so I wonder , who are the young people ?
the time of the F@@ DJ , where you were a youth until you were about 50 years or so , at which stage you changed over to the adult party apparatus , is over .
so it is a fact that we are having some problems in communicating , the most basic of which being about the age difference .
advancing this further , we find we are having even greater problems when we consider which type of young person we are discussing .
are we talking about AC@@ A ­ dem@@ ic youth for example , or about the younger management layer in the economy , or are we talking about ' disadvantaged youth as indicated by Mr. T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is and the EC programmes ?
and talking about all these groups , what dimensions are we thinking of ?
I believe that we have to realize that youth exchange is not directed at youth in the broad@@ est sense , and that we will always be addressing relatively small groups of young people .
I see there are several suggestions .
this seems to contradict the proposals for placing youth at the centre which have been made here .
perhaps though it may also complement those proposals .
a realistic proposal would be one which points towards organizing cooperation amongst regions , alongside other things .
for aid , support and solidarity always become tangible when you can actually experience where they are being applied and what people are doing with them .
on this basis , I believe , it is also possible to attract young people and to tackle joint East @@@ -@@ @ West projects as well .
I think that it will be useful then to consider these young people as active parties to such joint endeav@@ ours .
I believe , and would like to note that , a link between work and recreation , for example , is certainly a very useful one .
but I believe that , on the other hand , it also harb@@ ours a great dan ger , and I would like to expand on that by using the example of the Fre@@ ie Deutsche Ju@@ g@@ end .
the youth exchange conducted by the F@@ DJ with East European countries enjoyed very broad participation .
we just heard that the number of young people who travelled to Poland every year reached 4@@ 50,000 .
but there also was an East @@@ -@@ @ West youth exchange which was conducted by F@@ DJ bureaucrats .
just ask youth associations and youth organizations in the Western part of Germany and they will tell you about youth exchange with the F@@ DJ .
according to the stories people told about it , it was a rather ambi@@ valent kind of youth exchange , and those stories were told only in secret .
this poses two questions for me .
the first one is : in view of the scarce resources available , on what basis should young people be selected ?
who makes the decisions , that is the crucial point for the East European countries , i.e. , who ultimately decides who takes part in youth measures ?
the second issue : I believe that in view of the first tr@@ in@@ ational experience in the area of youth exchange it is important to take a look at tr@@ in@@ ational projects involving two East European countries .
there is no unified Germany .
the youth situation in Eastern Germany is distinctly problematic .
there is a serious lack of appren@@ tic@@ eship positions .
I believe this is an important piece of background information .
we do need a certain stability here .
I am very much in favour of organizing young people 's activities .
as a result , youth exchanges will have to be developed on the basis of joint projects in order to main ­ tain a corresponding continuity of interest , preclu@@ ding one ­ off tour@@ istic activities .
let me once more refer to the East ­ West problem in Germany .
I believe that the many pro ­ blems facing youth exchange can be clarified by using the example of the youth situation in the Eastern part of Germany .
one must look at their attitudes , at the way they perceive the unification of Germany , the opening of borders , their own new chances and opportunities , their changed life situations and their py@@ sch@@ ology .
in 1989 , when the Wall came down , the first exchanges were governed by a sense of euphoria .
happiness ab@@ ounded , but the first experience of exchange was that here we have the poor relative from the East and there we have the rich relative from the West .
East Germans put up with this ; they presented their children in their Sunday clothes and accepted presents .
people went on the move , put themselves in motion and , for example , went to collect their welcoming money .
this welcoming money is a typically German phenomenon .
as an East German visiting West Berlin or West Germany for the first time in 1989 you got welcoming money .
reports · facts · opinions
my point is that there were two aspects to the exchange .
on the one hand East Germans went to collect their welcoming money , and on the other West Germans set out for the East , succum@@ bing to the addiction for specul@@ ating and real estate buying .
this is also what the EC expects new members to go through .
legal issues are at the basis of this , but another result is that the chances and opportunities one sees in one 's own country lose importance in many ways .
this is an essential consideration which concerns the situation of young people from East European countries or from Eastern Germany in youth exchanges .
they experience a withdrawal of attention , of security , of authority , of identity and of their competence to orient themselves .
I believe a devaluation of collective identity occu@@ red .
in this way national issues are brought to the fore again .
especially as regards such national issues young people tend to react with special involvement , with special emotion .
I feel that this new generation , which bears all the signs of a post @@@ -@@ @ revolution generation , make it necessary to have an especially sensitive youth exchange .
and I believe one should consider very carefully the real aims of youth exchange .
can the need for qualification actually be met by youth exchange ?
I believe this is not so .
I believe youth exchange must be clearly defined if it is to be an investment in European cultures understanding one another !
I came to think of this because , as concerns the development between the two German states , euphoria was very great in 1990 , and the willingness to share was similarly great .
two , three years have passed and we realize that the readiness in the Western part of Germany to share , in order to f@@ ür@@ ther the development of a common Germany , has deci@@ dedly decreased .
I am afraid that a similar development might take place in Europe as a whole .
in such a situation , encounter takes on ever greater importance .
in the East , structures will have to be developed , and in the West , the willingness to work together on an equal basis will also have to be developed .
I believe that the understanding among the European population concerning a common Europe is underdeveloped anyway .
and the understand ing you do find for Europe in Western Europe always means Western Europe .
through our measures we must jointly develop , in young people , the understanding that Europe does not by any means end at the O@@ der river .
the fear of loss is very great in the West .
for even within the EC , youth work is still a very underdeveloped area , despite the brave Stru@@ g ­ gle on the part of Mr. T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is , and we will have to develop this area jointly in terms of these new tasks .
Thomas Kr@@ ü@@ ger I believe , however , that such an exchange between regions is only one face of youth exchange .
if this is allowed to happen the young people from East European countries will simply move West .
therefore youth exchange is also a challenge to the West European countries not to let this happen .
let me again take issue with the thesis that ' there must be structures ' .
there must be structures to be developed on the basis of common sense , of a new European common sense concerning youth exchange .
namely on the basis of the different points of departure we dis ­ cus@@ sed .
and then it will have to be interconnected with expanded forms of youth exchange in Western European countries .
I believe that one C@@ AN@@ NOT simply concentrate on an exchange between regions , but one will rather have to take a good look at the deep gap between West and East , that is , the deep gap between rich and poor .
looking closely , one can even see this gap in Germany .
but it is much deeper when one takes an Eastern perspective .
it is good that the contradiction has taken us to the core of the discussion .
I am in full agreement with your last comment .
I do believe , however , that it is important to discuss the next concrete steps to be taken and to determine where to start .
may our conference be a starting point in this task .
in comparison with previous years the amount Gr@@ an ­ T@@ ed was enormous ; for example , in 1990 we accepted 22 projects with a total cost of 2@@ 25,000 EC@@ U , and in 1991 20 projects for 10@@ 9,000 EC@@ U .
it was under these circumstances that the idea to introduce a new str@@ and of activities , after the model of pilot projects implemented within the framework of the European Community Youth for Europe Programme , was developed .
they were also meant to act as a support for both the existing and recently established youth structures , and to facilitate the process of building completely new infrastructures .
it was therefore of particular importance that projects should be developed by young people themselves , in response to their own needs and interests , and that a wide spectrum of youth groups should be involved .
despite the very little time available for the preparation of projects ( 2 months ) we still received 87 applications .
they involve partners from all the European Community countries , except Luxem@@ burg , and many Polish institutions and represent both big urban areas and smaller regions .
it is interesting to note that the projects also involve young people from the socially marginalized communities , as well as the disabled .
unfortunately some doubt remains as to the quality of these projects .
the figure is not impressive , but the philosophy underlying selection was to finance well @@@ -@@ @ developed , interesting projects which demonstrate a commitment and involvement by the Polish partner .
since these activities can easily be financed within the traditional T@@ emp@@ us youth exchange , we proposed to transfer 22 such projects to the first round of this action for 1993 / 94 .
as an example of support for a new youth structure , a project prepared by the Centre for International Youth Exchange in Tor@@ un ( which has recently been established with the goal of promoting cooperation and international youth exchange ) should be mentioned .
the accepted projects are designed to support the concept of European integration and international cooperation through the establishment , for example , of The Club of the European , editing a publication " Green Magazine " or of an ecological and educational centre in Poland .
conclusion · The idea of pilot projects supporting the innovative activities of newly @@@ -@@ @ established and existing Polish organizations within the framework of cooperation with EC partners seems to be interesting to both sides .
reports · facts · opinions
the poss@@ sibility of implementing various ideas with the support of T@@ emp@@ us funds has encouraged a large number of youth communities in Poland to establish international links .
this is extremely important for two reasons .
firstly , we can see that there are more and more organizations of various types emerging particularly in the regions of Poland where apart from the sc@@ out movement youth structures had been non @@@ -@@ @ existent .
secondly , these young people are searching for new solutions and ideas .
it seems that in these areas the experiences of Western partners respond to the needs of young people in Poland .
they can therefore be of some help in solving their problems .
this is probably why there is so much interest in training courses on the one hand , and in the high quality of some of these projects on the other .
in general this is demonstrated by the fact that in a number of cases there was clearly no involvement on the Polish side in the preparation of projects .
in such cases misunderstandings are quite frequent , and some of the pilot projects are a good example of this .
one can question the rationale of this approach , as it does not help to create a sense of commitment and responsibility among young people .
we hope , however , that this will change with time , and that young people will become more active participants .
this year 's experience indicates that some changes to the guidelines for pilot projects may be necessary .
this would provide an opportunity to present innovative ideas without unnecessary delay for those who display so much enthusiasm and energy in their endeavour to activate the otherwise dor@@ man@@ t local communities .
and finally , let me express our sincere conviction that all our efforts will contribute to the development of new and democratic structures of youth cooperation in the United Europe .

furthermore they lack the experience in sti ­ mul@@ ating and developing such organizations .
these organiz@@ a ­ tions are considered to be of great importance for youth policy in general and youth exchange in particular .
both through the exchange of experts and of young people , experience already gained in this field in Western countries should be made accessible .
a basic condition for co ­ operation is the accessibility of relevant information to all involved .

the main issues in this exchange of information were :

the decentralization of the assessment and the weighing of programmes and applications to national levels should be con ­ si@@ dered .

jointly , we arrived at the following conclusions : sions :
what are the main considerations to be taken into account when designing new programmes for East @@@ -@@ @ West youth exchange ?
two basic concerns could be noted among our group .
youth exchange professionals , on the other hand , pointed out the specific educational requirements of international exchange programmes which have to be systematically developed anew for cooperation be t@@ ween East and West .
all of these Lev@@ els are jointly responsible . 2 .
in addition , successful youth exchange programmes depend on responsible decentralization all the way down to local community level , with a multi@@ tier financial system enabling the building and maintenance of youth policy structures .
they are valuable instruments in combat@@ ting poverty , social exclusion , lack of tol@@ eration , xenophobia , racism .
they can make a decisive contribution to strengthening the self @@@ -@@ @ confidence and individual identity of young people and to encouraging them to be active within their community in their daily lives .
in East and West , youth exchange is still considered a luxury and has the lowest political priority .
because of this fact , youth politicians and youth associations are forced to make efforts to convince decision makers and to search for new ways of financing .
representatives of private foundations reported on the innovative character of the models of international cooperation they support .
for the foreseeable future , financing successful programmes exclusively from national budgets will not be possible !
at the beginning of the 90 's , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been in@@ un@@ dated by political , social and ecological problems which seem almost impossible to solve .
economic plight , budgetary deficits and the lack of legal safeguards for developing organizational structures hamper the shaping of the youth policy sector and still impede equality in the fle@@ dg@@ ling East @@@ -@@ @ West cooperation in youth exchange .
they must be designed in such a way that they can make a contribution to an equal co @@@ -@@ @ existence of peoples .

new ways of financing in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe :
they are more or less efficient interim solutions in view of the fact that building systems of financing for youth policy could take several more years .
several examples of youth aid provided by such foundations and funds were presented in our working group .
these foundations are dependent on donations , inher@@ it@@ ances , voluntary contributions from firms and businesses and also from individuals .
these are the means available for the financing of certain projects outside the state budget .
at best , they complement the state budget .
private contributions , however , are only marginal to foundation budgets .
therefore , funds and foundations usually have to use their capital to earn money which in turn is again used to earn money or finance the foundations activities .

a few ideas and factors in training methods for cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural learning
the brief introduction to certain aspects of cros@@ scul@@ tural learning as an aim of exchange highlighted the wealth of possibilities , but also , certainly , the complexities .
in cros@@ scul@@ tural learning , the method of approach used in understanding what is for e@@ ign is of particular significance .
it is only when confronted with other customs and other environments that it is possible to see more clearly where the differences , similarities , and common points are .
to this conception of working on the differences must be added the question of dealing with conflicts .
it can often be noted that , for the majority of organizers and leaders of international youth events , as well as for those who take part in them , the appearance of conflicts is deemed to be a threat or a sign of failure .
however , in order to be able to insti@@ gate , and follow through , a reasonably effective cros@@ scul@@ tural approach , mere additional general training is certainly not enough - specific train ing is required .
this method of dealing with conflicts closes " How to comprehend a culture . "
according to E.@@ T. Hall , each culture has its own particular system for " living " and structuring time .
the more we can learn to overcome them without destroying each other , the more chance we have of finding constructive solutions .
without going into greater detail , it seems there are some cultures with faster rhythms than others .
experience has shown that the simple fact of human beings meeting each other does not necessarily lead to a better mutual understanding or the elimination of pre@@ conceptions .
contact is just as likely to reinforce pre@@ conceptions and create misunderstandings .
however , the " suppression of pre@@ conceptions " continues to be one of the aims most cited in the theory of training for international youth events .
we can ask ourselves whether it is genuinely possible to wipe out such pre@@ conceptions that may form a part of an individual 's character in only a few days .
this is not a ple@@ a to strengthen pre@@ conceptions , but rather to take them into account , in both form and content , as they very often contain a certain element of truth .
in no case must the desire to suppress them lead to the rejection of all gener@@ alizations in contacts with the representatives of different cultures .
in any case , it is worth reflecting on the function of pre@@ conceptions ( as an aid to self @@@ -@@ @ definition , experiencing one 's own identity through a clearer separation of the self and non @@@ -@@ @ self ) .
• the use of private and public , individual and collective spaces .
which ( groups or individuals ) parade their national identity ?
to attract attention ?
to be noticed ?
because this facilitates contacts , or because it helps to avoid them ?
stressing what the national group has in common , is it reassuring ?
is it a way of not feeling left out , not having to worry about the others or of being accepted ?
does the presence of foreigners bring out hidden aspects of the collective national identity ?
are differences within a culture more easily expressed ?
do minorities which are used to being rejected and void of influence find a voice more easily ?

the meeting of different cultures provides an opportunity to realize that one 's own cultural universe is relative , is limited , and is derived from things that have evolved and which are modi@@ fiable .
a society @@@ -@@ @ cent@@ red attitude , as the point of departure for encounters between people of different cultures , is still the rule today .
we also know that this attitude does not change automatically as a result of international contacts .
on the contrary , very often such contacts do not result in different points of view being put into perspective , but rather in their being reinforced .
this is where teaching methods for cros@@ scul@@ tural learning come in .
the whole art consists of creating a background against which those from other cultures are not seen from the outset as a threat , a challenge , a restriction of freedom of movement or autonomy .
it is an invitation to be circum@@ spect and questioning , but also curious .
recently , " empathy " has often been considered as the key factor in the concept of " cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural learning . "
empathy being de fined as the ability to think and feel from the other person 's point of view , while at the same time acknowledging that this is an aim that can be achieved , rather than as a point of departure for teaching .

verbal communication
one of the main problems arising in cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural encounter situations is that of knowing how to go about planning joint projects , while still managing to take into account the diversity of the feelings and cultural behavi@@ ours present .
this can lead to several variants on working in single , bin@@ ational or multinational groups , etc .
the " blending " aspect , i.e. , making the group " one big family , " should not automatically nor necessarily be the goal to be attained .
it is preferable to encourage neighbour@@ ly relations , that will permit those involved to approach and withdraw , according to the time and circumstances or individual and collective feelings .
such an approach to " distance management " should in no way prevent the formation of personal friend@@ ships .
remaining with the subject of group lead ership methods , it is as well to be aware that they are not neutral , and may be the bearers of values that belong to the culture from which they eman@@ ate .

cros@@ scul@@ tural learning in Franco @@@ -@@ @ German exchanges has always been on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ spot learn ing during an event .
they should also think about the significance of using interpreters or other arrangements , with the advantages and drawbacks these involve .
• The approach to what are called points in common : here experience shows that , to begin with , points in common are taken for granted in all spheres where differences are not clearly defined .
during the events these differences often continue to be concealed so as not to spoil the good atmosphere , and this can only diminish the opportunities to learn .
circum@@ spection and a questioning , investigative and experimental attitude take on an extra importance .
• Met@@ ac@@ ommun@@ ications and met@@ ath@@ em@@ es : the contempl@@ ation of experience and relating it to a wider system , these are essential themes in cros@@ scul@@ tural learning .
practice has shown that it is not sufficient to merely note what is different in order to have quality met@@ ac@@ ommun@@ ication , one must also reflect on the differences and the reasons for them .

over the last 45 years all Central and Eastern European countries have developed in a similar manner , being so unfortunate in 1945 as to be liberated from one occupation and then occupied again .
it was to represent the interests of young people both at government level and abroad .
all young people had to become , first , pioneers and then , later , members of the socialist youth organization .
whoever refused to join this undemocratic game had to forget about high school or college , and their parents ' careers also came to an end .
the two largest organizations are the Christian Democratic Youth and the Youth Union ( the former S@@ Z@@ M ) with about 10,000 members each .
the decision @@@ -@@ @ making body is the general assembly which is convened twice a year .
in the intervening periods business is conducted by a seven @@@ -@@ @ member managing board which is formed by representatives from different youth organizations .
when the Communists seized power in 1948 , the students were among the few who protested , but they were silenced ruth@@ lessly .
in the period between 1950 and 1958 the Communists succeeded in winning over a proportion of youth to socialist ¡ deals .
thousands of young people participated in giant construction projects such as the ' Youth Power Plant ' , ' Youth Railway ' or ' Youth D@@ am ' .
in spite of clever propaganda , censorship and ideological state terror , however , the regime did not succeed in convincing youth in the long term .
in 1968 the students of Prague and Bratislava were the first to support the reforms initiated by the Dub@@ c@@ ek government .
this enthusiasm was very short @@@ -@@ @ lived , unfortunately , and after the invasion by Russian tanks not only the youth but the whole of society fell into deep apathy .

the results from a number of surveys carried out during the last three years show a clearly defined trend : many young people would prefer to realize their ambitions and efforts outside of Bulgaria .
this has resulted in emigration , with over 400,000 emigrants , of whom 90 per cent are under 35 years of age .
another survey has shown 2 / 3 of Bulgarian young people to be potential emigrants .
• Projects connected with combat@@ ting drug addiction , prostitution , crime , violence , aggression toward foreign groups and religious influ@@ enc@@ es@@ . ences .
the fifth problem results from the low rate of economic activity and the growth in youth unemployment ( 49 per cent of the unemployed are under 30 years old ) .
the sixth problem is the demographic situation , notably the increased birth rate .
furthermore there is serious lack of information concerning the organization of youth policy in Europe .

country : all NIS ( New@@ ly independent states ) Project Cost : 4 M EC@@ U Project title : T@@ AC@@ IS Democracy Programme
following the successful development of a programme in Central Europe for the promotion of democracy , it is intended to extend the programme to the countries of the ex @@@ -@@ @ Soviet Union .
this is to be reflected in many ways .
it is related to the character of government , but also to the broader environment of every citizen , from civic rights to consumer protection , from the right to assembly to the right to a free press .
final recipient : • The parliaments , nongovernmental organizations and others of the ex @@@ -@@ @ Soviet Union contributing to the construction of a more plur@@ alistic society .
implementation timetable : as soon as implementation mechanisms are set in place with PH@@ ARE , a call for proposals will be made .
this should lead to the examination of proposals around January 1994 with a view to contracts beginning March 1994 .
projects will in general last approximately one year .
the T@@ AC@@ IS programme has been created to assist the countries of the former Soviet Union to create the conditions for the development of a market economy .
while some of the instruments of support are directly related to the strengthening of understanding of the institutions and instruments of the market , these in turn are underpinned by a functioning plur@@ alistic society .

the T@@ AC@@ IS Programme will provide one @@@ -@@ @ off non @@@ -@@ @ reimbur@@ s@@ able grants to support projects designed to achieve one or more of the objectives outlined above .
projects to be supported by the T@@ AC@@ IS Democracy Programme will be supported by a local beneficiary , and will involve more than one EC Partner organization .
this will prevent the programme from covering activities already supported under other bilateral programmes .
applicants will be required to explain the sources of project funds other than those of the Community .
the T@@ AC@@ IS Democracy Programme will operate with the same advisory committee as now operates in the case of PH@@ ARE .
this en ables a substantial measure of coordination , since the Council of Europe is represented , and there is an observer who is well informed of the activities in this field of the USA .
Implement@@ ai@@ on of projects under this facility will be monitored via detailed reporting requirements , and through the delegation of the Commission in Moscow and other NIS capitals .
the procedures to be followed are almost entirely inspired from the experience gained in the implement@@ ai@@ on of the PH@@ ARE Democracy Programme .
in 1992 , some 3@@ 45 projects were received by PH@@ ARE , and 52 were selected for co @@@ -@@ @ financing .
this gives some sense of the scale of the operation anticipated in the T@@ AC@@ IS Democracy Programme .

the preparation of the report would not have been possible without the close collaboration and support provided by Eur@@ y@@ dice , the network on education systems and policies in Europe and the Bologna Fol@@ low @@@ -@@ @ Up Group .
since the beginning of the 2000s , the Bologna Process has expanded from the European Union towards the neighbouring countries and the Bologna Declaration has by now been signed by 47 countries .
the present report is a first attempt to describe the implementation of the Bologna Process in the countries participating in the T@@ emp@@ us programme , including signat@@ ory and non @@@ -@@ @ signat@@ ory countries of the Bologna Declaration .
the results show the attractiveness of the concepts and tools promoted by the Bologna Process and the in@@ disputable efforts made by countries not involved in the process to come closer to the European Higher Education Area .
it is also responsible for gathering and analysing information needed to guide the implementation of these programmes .
this study was put together by the unit in charge of the management of the T@@ emp@@ us programme , in close cooperation with the unit coordinating Eur@@ y@@ dice , the well @@@ -@@ @ known network on education systems and policies in Europe .
the data was provided by the National T@@ emp@@ us Offices , in agreement with the national authorities and the EU Deleg@@ ations of the countries concerned .
the report is primarily targeted at all stakeholders of the T@@ emp@@ us programme , including current and future beneficiaries of T@@ emp@@ us projects .
I am convinced that the analysis of the unique data collected in this report will help them to refine their strategies and to optim@@ ise the impact of the programme and individual projects on higher education in the T@@ emp@@ us countries .
hopefully this can also lead to the development of ambitious regional and cross regional strategies .

progressively , other countries which have launched reflections and reforms of their higher education systems have used the Bologna Process and the EU Higher Education Moder@@ n@@ isation Agenda as a source of inspiration and reference .
the T@@ emp@@ us partner countries belong to both categories ( Map 1 ) and this report covers therefore a variety of situations .
data was collected in accordance with two main approaches :

state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
executive summary
the aim of this report is to map , for the first time , the state of play of the Bologna Process in the 28 countries participating in the T@@ emp@@ us programme .
the report shows that certain geographical areas with common backgrounds tend to apply the Bologna Process in a similar way .
this is particularly the case in the Maghreb countries , where the higher education systems are relatively similar and have been influenced by their long lasting connections with Europe .
another area with a relatively homogeneous level of Bologna implementation is the region of the Western Balkans characterised by its common aspiration to acc@@ ede to the EU .
the first category consists of the three cycle degree structure and EC@@ TS .
these are widely used in the T@@ emp@@ us countries and they are clearly the most well known elements of the Bologna Process .
the second category contains the introduction of the Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement , the development of a National Quali@@ fications Framework and the setting @@@ -@@ @ up of an independent body for quality assurance in higher education .
in this respect , T@@ emp@@ us countries are still at very different stages of development and none of them have fully adopted these tools .
interestingly , the same phenomenon can be noted in the EU countries ( Eur@@ y@@ dice Focus 2010 ) .
on the basis of this report , T@@ emp@@ us countries can be divided into three main groups .
countries of the second group - Maghreb countries , Eastern Europe and the Central Asian countries - have adopted certain elements of the Bologna Process , but are still far from full implementation .
the Bologna Three Cy@@ cle Structure
one of the main components of the Bologna Process is the division of higher education programmes into three sequential levels namely first , second and third cycles , leading to three main kinds of qualifications and degrees : bachelor , Master and Doc@@ torate .
a common model has been developed for the Bac@@ helor and Master programmes whereas the third cycle has , to a large extent , been left in the hands of universities with no attempt to introduce further regulation within the Bologna Process .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
at Bac@@ helor level , two main models have been adopted in the T@@ emp@@ us countries : programmes designed on the basis of 180 EC@@ TS credits ( lasting 3 academic years ) and programmes of 240 EC@@ TS credits ( 4 years ) .
the choices made in the different countries seem to reflect their geo @@@ -@@ @ political context and the historical clo@@ seness between countries in certain areas .
for example , the 240 credit model dominates in countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia , in which the higher education systems have a common historical background .
on the other hand , countries such as Lebanon and the Maghreb countries have opted for the 180 credit model , which reflects their close connections with education systems of certain EU countries .
at Doc@@ toral level , as in Europe , many developments are at an early stage and common patterns are difficult to identify .
European Credit Transfer and Acc@@ um@@ ulation System ( EC@@ TS )
EC@@ TS is a tool which enables students to collect credits for learning achieved through higher education .
in practice , 60 EC@@ TS credits are attached to the workload of a full @@@ -@@ @ time year of formal learning ( academic year ) and the associated learning outcomes .
almost all T@@ emp@@ us countries have adopted a credit system and the majority of them are currently implementing EC@@ TS at least to a certain extent .
however , harmon@@ ised implementation is still far from being reality and only four countries ( Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 6 , Moldova and Serbia ) have reached the level of full implementation .
most T@@ emp@@ us countries are nevertheless committed to implement EC@@ TS and 16 of them have introduced legislation governing the implementation of the credit system .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
as in the EU countries , there is room for improvement regarding the use of student workload and learning outcomes as the basis for defining credits .
the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement is a document attached to a higher education diploma that aims to improve international transparency and facilitate academic and professional recognition of qualifications .
it consists of eight sections describing in particular the nature , level , context , content and status of the studies that were successfully completed .
it also includes a description of the higher education system in the country .
currently more than half of the T@@ emp@@ us countries are committed to use the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement ( DS ) .
this principle is currently applied in 12 T@@ emp@@ us countries , which shows a considerable improvement over the recent years .
regarding the language in which the Bologna DS is issued , the majority of T@@ emp@@ us countries issue it in the language of instruction and / or English .
national Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works ( N@@ Q@@ F )
however , three countries ( Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Tunisia ) have reached the level where a National Quali@@ fications Network for higher education has been formally adopted and the implementation process has started .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
the Lisbon Rec@@ og@@ nition Convention is an international convention , which allows qualifications granted in one country to be recognised in another country on the basis of defined standards .
the convention has been elaborated jointly by the Council of Europe and UNESCO and it has already been signed by more than 50 countries in Europe and beyond .
it is addressed in priority to Members of the Council of Europe and the UNESCO Europe and North America region .
the Lisbon Convention has been widely ratified by the T@@ emp@@ us countries , in particular by those which are Bologna signat@@ ory countries and also members of the Council of Europe .
the principle of recognition of foreign qualifications is nevertheless applied in most of the other T@@ emp@@ us countries as well .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
part 1 - The Bologna three cycle structure
the three cycle degree structure is one of the main components of the Bologna Process which the signat@@ ory countries are committed to implement in view of the creation of the European Higher Education Area .
these are probably the main reasons to explain the success of the initiative initially launched in 1998 by four countries ( Sor@@ bon@@ ne Declaration ) and its progressive extension beyond the borders of the EU and even beyond the Bologna signat@@ ory countries .
in the countries in which these concepts were rather unknown , the implementation of the three cycle structure had far reaching consequences , going beyond the simple re@@ organisation of the degree structure .
this was particularly true in continental Europe where traditional academic university programmes had a restricted flexibility to respond to lear@@ ners ' needs .
the Bologna Process provides a flexible framework to implement such changes and is in no way a prescrip@@ tive instrument .
the development of the third cycle has , to a large extent , been left in the hands of universities with no attempt to introduce further regulation within the Bologna Process .
in practice , the first cycle qualifications typically comprise 180 @@@ -@@ @ 240 EC@@ TS credits ( three to four years ) and the second cycle qualifications 90 @@@ -@@ @ 120 EC@@ TS credits with a minimum of 60 credits .
at Doc@@ toral level , as in Europe , many developments are at an early stage and common patterns are difficult to identify .
9 An academic year typically comprises 60 EC@@ TS credits ( see part 2 ) .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
in 2009 / 2010 , the Bologna dynamic has widely reached the neighbouring countries of the EU and the Central Asian countries ( Map 2 ) .
apart from Israel and Lebanon , countries in the Middle East have already an existing three cycle structure .
however , in these countries like in Europe , Master programmes last one to two years but they are usually an integral part of the process towards a doc@@ torate .
Uzbekistan belongs also to the category of countries where the system is based on a national three cycle structure .
bachelor degrees usually last 4 years , and Master degrees not less than 2 years .
the third cycle - post@@ graduate education includes the candidate qualification ( Fan@@ lar Nom@@ z@@ od@@ i ) and the doc@@ torate ( Fan@@ lar D@@ ok@@ tor@@ i ) .
Turkmenistan is the only T@@ emp@@ us country which does not have a three cycle structure .
following the Presidential Decree of February 2007 , the basic university studies consist of 5 @@@ -@@ @ year programmes except for medicine and some programmes in arts which last 6 years .
after 3 years of additional studies , graduates can obtain a degree of " Candidate of Sciences , " followed by " Doctor of Sciences . "
various Bac@@ helor structures revealing the geo @@@ -@@ @ political context
nevertheless , the arguments used to oppose the changes are often the expression of a certain inertia or conservatism .
as in the EU , medical studies and related fields , as well as architecture and engineering are examples of study fields where long study programmes are often still proposed .
as regards the mod@@ alities of implementation of the Bologna cycle structure , the analysis below focuses on the structures which have been most commonly implemented in the T@@ emp@@ us countries .
nevertheless , in the majority of countries , there is clearly a reference model ( if not a single compulsory model ) that applies to the majority of institutions and programmes .
with regard to the Bac@@ helor programmes ( Map 3 ) , two main structural models have been adopted , as in the EU : bachelor programmes usually designed on the basis of 180 EC@@ TS credits ( 3 years ) and programmes lasting 240 EC@@ TS credits ( 4 years ) .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
this is due to the eight Eastern T@@ emp@@ us countries , namely Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Russia , Ukraine and the countries of the Caucasus .
Lebanon and the Maghreb countries on the contrary have adopted the 180 EC@@ TS credit system influenced by their long lasting relations with certain EU member states .
in the Western Balkans the situation is intermediary and more diversified , various combinations existing in most countries .
the same applies to Belarus , Israel and Moldova .
the 120 EC@@ TS credit ( 2 academic years ) model commonly adopted for Master programmes
this model is the most commonly used reference to design programmes in the Maghreb , the Caucasus and the Central Asian countries having adopted the Bologna structure .
it is also the case for Croatia , Israel , Lebanon , Moldova , Montenegro and Russia .

part 2 - The European Credit Transfer and Acc@@ um@@ ulation System ( EC@@ TS )
the EC@@ TS system was initially developed at the end of the 1980s , at the time when the Er@@ as@@ mus Programme was launched .
initially used for credit transfer to facilitate student mobility it also became a credit accumulation system , encouraged by the Berlin Comm@@ uniqu@@ é in September 2003 .
EC@@ TS is a tool which enables students to collect credits for learning achieved through higher education .
it is a lear@@ ner @@@ -@@ @ cent@@ red system which aims to increase transparency of learning outcomes and learning processes .
it aims to facilitate planning , delivery , evaluation , recognition and validation of qualifications and units of learning .
as a result , EC@@ TS makes teaching and learning more transparent and facilitates the recognition of studies , whether formal , non @@@ -@@ @ formal or informal .
it also serves curriculum design and quality assurance , by facilitating the comparison of programmes and structures .
EC@@ TS credits are based on the work@@ load@@ 12 needed in order to achieve expected learning out@@ com@@ es@@ 13 .
EC@@ TS is one of the corner@@ stones of the Bologna Process and it is increasingly used by institutions in other continents .
the analysis below tries to capture to which extent EC@@ TS is used and describes also the main national understandings of the system .
experience shows that there is considerable diversity in the interpretation of EC@@ TS at national and also institutional level .
most countries committed to implement EC@@ TS
Morocco has recently adopted and implemented the modular approach to design the study programmes and is considering the possibility of introducing the credit concept .
all the other countries have adopted a credit system and the majority of them are currently implementing EC@@ TS as defined within the Bologna Process .
in 16 countries , namely the countries of Western Balkans , and Caucasus , Algeria , Kyrgyzstan , Moldova , Tunisia and Ukraine , EC@@ TS is underpinned by legislation ( Map 7 ) .
in many countries , the introduction of EC@@ TS often started with a pilot phase and the system was then extended and phased in gradually during the second half of the 2000s .
for instance in Ukraine , EC@@ TS has been introduced without legislation since 2004 and the relevant legislation was adopted in 2009 .
12 Work@@ load indicates the time students typically need to complete all learning activities required to achieve the expected learning outcomes .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
in a limited number of other countries ( Lebanon and Russia ) , EC@@ TS is being introduced without legislation favour@@ ing a non regulatory approach .
in Russia , the EC@@ TS @@@ -@@ @ based national credit system has been implemented on a voluntary basis since 2002 and guidelines have been developed and distributed by the Ministry to all Russian higher education institutions .
the remaining countries have their own national systems , as it is the case in Belarus , Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Kazakhstan , the Occu@@ pied Palestinian Territory and Uzbekistan .
in Kazakhstan , for instance , the national credit system is parallel to EC@@ TS and efforts are being made to make it compatible with EC@@ TS .
for the moment , equi@@ valence tables are used for student mobility overseas .
the analysis of the level of implementation of EC@@ TS ( Map 6 ) reveals a large variety of practices and confirms that harmon@@ ised implementation is far from being the current reality .
the introduction of EC@@ TS is a long process and full implementation will still take some time for most of the countries engaged in the process .
only a limited number of T@@ emp@@ us countries have reached that level . this is the case for Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 16 , Moldova and Serbia .
in a second group of countries ( Georgia , Russia , Ukraine ) more than 75 % of institutions and programmes are using EC@@ TS for both transfer and accumulation purposes .
contact hours ( hours spent by students on activities guided by teaching staff ) are no longer the reference to define the credits and they have been replaced by student workload .
nevertheless , in contrast to the previous group , learning outcomes have not yet become the usual reference for the system .
in a third category of countries ( Algeria , Albania , Azerbaijan , Croatia , Montenegro and Tunisia ) contact hours or a combination of contact hours and student workload are still used as a reference to define the credits .
nevertheless , as in the previous category , more than 75 % of institutions and programmes are using EC@@ TS for both transfer and accumulation purposes .

part 3 - The Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement
the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement ( DS ) is an instrument developed jointly by the European Union , the Council of Europe and UNESCO .
it has become one of the major Bologna tools to describe qualifications in an easily understandable way and relate them to the higher education system within which they were issued .
the purpose of the Bologna DS is to improve understanding of knowledge , skills and compet@@ ences acquired by an individual to facilitate academic mobility or to provide employers with relevant information .
a partial introduction of the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement
the last category includes countries such as Belarus , Egypt , Israel , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan .
the national Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement used in Belarus , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan is an official document presenting the academic subjects studied , the degree awarded and the type of final thesis .
in Egypt , students can benefit from a national DS consisting of a degree certificate per subject studied and a description of these subjects in terms of curricula and learning outcomes .
it is issued on request and in return for payment in Arabic or in English .
in Israel , the DS is also issued on request and in return for payment in the language of instruction or in other languages .
Kyrgyzstan and Israel are planning to implement the Bologna DS .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
this covers various activities such as training , information campaigns , hand@@ books , activities carried out by Bologna experts or T@@ emp@@ us Higher Education Re@@ forms Expert and EU funded projects .
the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement mostly issued automatically and free of charge
in line with the commitment made by the Education Ministers in the Berlin Comm@@ uniqu@@ é ( 2003 ) , the Bologna DS should be issued automatically and free of charge to graduates at the end of their studies .
however , in practice , it is still not the case in all countries and considerable variations in implementation are reported .
in 12 T@@ emp@@ us countries , namely Albania , Algeria , Armenia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Moldova , Montenegro , Serbia and Tunisia , the Bologna DS is issued automatically and free of charge .
for the Bologna signat@@ ory countries the situation has considerably improved since 2006 ( Eur@@ y@@ dice Focus 2007 ) .
in Algeria , whereas the former DS was issued on request , the new one will be automatically issued and free of charge .
in Azerbaijan , the DS is issued on request and free of charge .
various possibilities exist in Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 18 , Russia and Ukraine .
the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement mostly issued in the language of instruction and / or English
regarding the language in which the Bologna DS is issued , the majority of T@@ emp@@ us countries issue it in the language of instruction and / or English ( this is the case in Moldova , Ukraine , Russia and the Caucasus countries ) .
in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro and Serbia , the DS is issued in the national language and in English , as well as in the language of instruction in cases where a different language is used ( e.g. minority languages ) .
in Albania , Algeria , Croatia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Kazakhstan , Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 18@@ and Tunisia , the DS is issued in the language of instruction and / or more official languages .
for instance , in Algeria , the DS is issued in Arabic or in French .
in Tunisia , the DS is only issued in French for the moment , but it will soon be also delivered in Arabic and English .
finally , it is worth noting that no T@@ emp@@ us country issues the Bologna DS solely in English as is the case in some countries in the EU , for instance the Scandinavian countries and Cyprus .

part 4 - Stage towards establishing a National Quali@@ fications Framework ( N@@ Q@@ F )
it describes the different qualifications and other learning achievements that can be obtained in a given country and relates them coher@@ ently to each other .
it shows what a lear@@ ner knows , understands and is able to do on the basis of a given qualification and how lear@@ ners can move between qualifications .
qualifications frameworks play an important role in developing degree systems and study programmes at higher education institutions .
they are also important instruments in achieving compar@@ ability and transparency between different national systems and facilitating the movement of lear@@ ners .
these instruments should reflect the shift from traditional input @@@ -@@ @ based approaches of categor@@ ising qualifications towards a focus on learning outcomes , credits and the profile of qualifications .
at European level , the development of National Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works has been encouraged in recent years by a range of initiatives and processes .
these National Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works for higher education would include reference to the Bologna three @@@ -@@ @ cycle study structure and the use of generic descrip@@ tors based on learning outcomes , compet@@ ences and credits for the first and second cycles .
in parallel to the above mentioned process , a European Quali@@ fications Framework ( E@@ Q@@ F ) for lifelong learning has been developed in the context of the Lisbon strategy and adopted by the European Council and Parliament in 2008 .
the main purpose of the E@@ Q@@ F is to act as a " translation device " and neutral reference point for comparing qualifications across different education and training systems .
these steps have been defined by the Eur@@ y@@ dice net@@ work@@ 19@@ on the basis of the recommended ten steps scale proposed by the Bologna Fol@@ low @@@ -@@ @ up Group 's ( B@@ F@@ U@@ G ) working group on Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works led by the Council of Europe .

part 5 - National Bo@@ dies for Quality As@@ surance
in higher education , quality assurance can be defined as policies , procedures and practices that are designed to achieve , maintain or enhance quality as it is understood in a specific context .
it consists of both internal and external processes .
mutual recognition in the field of quality assurance in higher education calls for the development of clearly defined and commonly accepted evaluation and accreditation criteria and methodologies .
to achieve this objective , national quality evaluation systems should not only include the bodies responsible for this task but also specify their composition and fundamental goals .
the Standards and Guidelines for Quality As@@ surance in the European Higher Education Area produced by EN@@ Q@@ A are a widely used reference when setting up such bodies .
in most countries , internal services of the relevant Ministry deal directly with quality assurance .
in Israel , for the moment , a government @@@ -@@ @ dependent body , the Quality Assessment Unit in the Council for Higher Education , is mainly responsible for evaluating and ac@@ crediting study programmes .
however , it is foreseen that this body will soon deal with the evaluation of institutions as well .
in Russia , quality assurance is also managed by independent agencies in addition to the Ministry , which shows the ongoing transition towards an independent quality assurance system .
Albania , Moldova , Montenegro and Tunisia are planning to establish independent agencies for quality assurance .
in Tunisia , the Law on higher education ( 2008 ) fores@@ ees the creation of an independent agency by 2012 .
in the meantime , the National Evaluation Committee , a government @@@ -@@ @ dependent body assisted by experts , is still in charge of quality assurance .
in some countries , e.g. Armenia , the body dealing with quality assurance was first established within the Ministry of Education .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , two independent agencies ( Board for accreditation and Higher Education Evaluation Agency ) are responsible for evaluating and ac@@ crediting institutions and programmes .
the national independent agencies are usually responsible for institutions and programmes from the public and private sectors .
the main outcomes of evaluations by National independent agencies are decisions and advice
in the five remaining countries ( i.e. Armenia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Georgia , Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 21 ) , the outcomes of evaluations are both decisions and advice .

part 6 - The Lisbon Convention : the recognition of foreign qualifications
the Lisbon Rec@@ og@@ nition Convention is an international convention elaborated jointly by the Council of Europe and UNE@@ SC@@ O@@ 22 .
it concerns in priority the Members of the Council of Europe and the UNESCO Europe and North America region .
it allows qualifications granted in one country to be recognised in another country on the basis of defined stand@@ ard@@ s@@ 23 .
regarding the Bologna Process , the Convention has become one of its key instruments to achieve the European Higher Education Area .
the Convention stipulates that degrees and periods of studies must be assessed and recognised in another country unless substantial differences are proved .
students and graduates are guaranteed fair procedures under the Convention .
this network was complemented in 1984 by an initiative of the European Commission : the National Academic Rec@@ og@@ nition Information Centres network ( N@@ AR@@ IC Network ) .
the two networks are intertwined and cooperate on all recognition issues .
the Committee of the Convention is responsible for promoting the application of the Convention and overseeing its implementation whereas the EN@@ IC Network supports the national authorities in enforcing it .
the Convention has also been signed by Belarus , Israel , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan , which are not member States of the Council of Europe but members of the UNESCO Europe and North America region .
Tajikistan , which is also a member of the UNESCO Europe and North America region , has not signed the Convention but has ratified the text .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
the remaining T@@ emp@@ us countries ( Algeria , Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Morocco , the Occu@@ pied Palestinian Territory , Syria and Tunisia ) are not part of the Lisbon Convention .
nevertheless , the M@@ ER@@ IC network ( Mediterranean Rec@@ og@@ nition Information Centres Network ) can play a useful role .
built on a T@@ emp@@ us pilot project , the M@@ ER@@ IC network was launched by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Mediterranean Rec@@ og@@ nition Convention in June 2005 .

in practice , Ministries of Education or dependent bodies are usually responsible for recogn@@ ising foreign qualifications .
whereas an assessment of foreign qualifications often used to entail a detailed comparison of curricula and lists of material studied , the emphasis has now shifted to a broader comparison of the qualifications earned in signat@@ ory countries .
although not signat@@ ory countries , Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 24 and Tajikistan have implemented relevant regulation in the spirit of the Convention .
the recognition of qualifications is therefore granted in line with the Lisbon Convention principles .
in Israel , accredited higher education institutions enjoy academic autonomy to admit students according to their own criteria .
it is worth noting that the principle of recognition of qualifications granted in another country is nevertheless also applied in other T@@ emp@@ us countries .

brief overview of the T@@ emp@@ us programme
T@@ emp@@ us is the EU 's external cooperation programme that supports since 20 years the modernisation of higher education systems in the European Union 's neighbouring countries .
the partner countries have changed throughout the years ; currently the programme covers countries of the Western Balkans , Central Asia , Eastern Europe , Northern Africa and the Middle East@@ 25 .
since the beginning , T@@ emp@@ us contributes to the promotion of cooperation between higher education institutions of the European Union and the partner countries , in particular via various capacity building activities .
it also promotes the voluntary convergence of higher education systems in these countries with EU developments in higher education , including the Bologna Process .
indeed , the Bologna Process has become a reference point for most of T@@ emp@@ us partner countries by setting in motion a series of reforms to modern@@ ise higher education systems and make them more compatible and comparable .
at the beginning , the focus was put on higher education systems in countries that later joined the European Union .
the second phase of the programme , T@@ emp@@ us II , covered the period of 1994 @@@ -@@ @ 2000 .
during that time , the programme was extended to new eligible countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia .
national priorities defined by national authorities were introduced .
the third phase of T@@ emp@@ us was implemented from 2000 to 2006 .
the concept of regional cooperation was introduced during that programme period .
in the framework of the Euro @@@ -@@ @ Mediterranean partnership , T@@ emp@@ us III was extended to North Africa and the Middle East , with a view to contributing to their socio @@@ -@@ @ economic development .
besides , the programme aimed at promoting inter@@ cultural understanding as a means to secure sustainable growth , peace and stability in the region and reinforce the inter@@ cultural and civil society dimension of the programme .
since 2007 , T@@ emp@@ us has entered in its fourth phase , which will be running until 2013 .
it puts emphasis on regional and cross @@@ -@@ @ regional cooperation and on the reinforcement of links between higher education and society .
the programme currently covers 28 partner countries and territories .
the programme is integrated into the European Union 's ' Neigh@@ bour@@ hood ' , ' En@@ larg@@ ement ' and ' Development ' policies , which aim to promote prosperity , stability and security in the targeted regions .
T@@ emp@@ us is funded by four specific EU financial instruments : the Instr@@ ument for P@@ re @@@ -@@ @ accession Assistance ( IP@@ A ) , the Development Cooperation Instr@@ ument ( D@@ CI ) , and the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
25 T@@ emp@@ us partner countries ( 2010 ) : Albania , Algeria , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Egypt , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Georgia , Israel , Jordan , Kazakhstan , Kosovo under UN@@ SC@@ R 12@@ 44 , Kyrgyzstan ,
Lebanon , Moldova , Montenegro , Morocco , the Occu@@ pied Palestinian Territory , Russia , Serbia , Syria , Tajikistan , Tunisia , Turkmenistan , Ukraine and Uzbekistan .

48 education level , the programme also aims at reinforcing civil society , promoting democracy , as well as enhancing mutual understanding and inter@@ cultural dialogue between the EU and its partners .
to achieve its objectives , T@@ emp@@ us IV supports three types of projects .
- Joint Projects are specifically designed for individual higher education institutions and fund multilateral partnerships between EU and partner country institutions .
they can focus on issues linked to the reform of governance in higher education institutions ( qualification systems , quality assurance mechanisms , autonomy of institutions ... ) , or foster links between higher education , the world of work and other sectors of education .
they can include studies and research , the organisation of national , regional and thematic conferences and seminars , the provision of training , policy advice and the dissemination of information .
both Joint Projects and Struc@@ tural Measures are funded through calls for proposals .
yearly , approximately 70 projects are funded . the financial support varies from 0.5 to 1.5 million EUR .
- Ac@@ compan@@ ying Measures are funded through C@@ alls for Ten@@ der or Framework Contrac@@ ts .
they are also used to fund the National T@@ emp@@ us Offices and the activities of the group of " Higher Education Reform Experts " in the T@@ emp@@ us partner countries .
the Education , Audi@@ ovis@@ ual and Culture Executive Agency ( E@@ A@@ CE@@ A ) is responsible for both the management and the implementation of T@@ emp@@ us , under powers delegated by the European Commission .
Europe@@ Aid Co @@@ -@@ @ Operation Office and Directorate @@@ -@@ @ General for En@@ larg@@ ement allocate funds directly to the Executive Agency to manage the programme and thus have the formal responsibility for supervis@@ ing its activities .
state of play of the Bologna Process in the T@@ emp@@ us countries ( 2009 / 2010 )
the Bologna Process is the product of a series of meetings of Ministers responsible for higher education at which policy decisions have been taken with the goal to establish a European Higher Education Area by 2010 .
the process also includes the European Commission as a full member .
the Council of Europe and UNESCO - CE@@ P@@ ES , along with a range of stakeholder organisations are also involved as consultative members .

Luxembourg : office for Official Pub@@ l@@ ications of the European Commun@@ ities , 1998
the Dob@@ ris assessment was presented to the third conference of Environment Ministers of all European countries , which met in Sofia in October 1995 .
they asked the EEA to produce a second assessment in time for their next planned meeting in Denmark in 1998 .
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment is the Agency 's response to this request .
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment gradually more comprehensive .
the resources made available for preparing this report were not by themselves sufficient to overcome this problem , and coverage of countries thus varies throughout the report .
in particular , a bias towards Western Europe could not be avoided .
nevertheless , the report provides the most comprehensive and reliable overview , with conclusions supported by a substantial body of background material from the whole of Europe .
the final section provides summar@@ ies of the 12 environmental topics reviewed in the main report .
country groupings used in this report :
NIS : the European New@@ ly Independent States ( not including the Baltic states ) Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , the Russian Federation , the Ukraine
in the text , for convenience , the term Eastern Europe is sometimes used to cover both Central and Eastern European countries and the New@@ ly Independent States .
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment
problems Table 1 gives an overall summary assessment of progress over ( roughly ) the past five years for each of the 12 key European environmental problems identified in the Dob@@ ris assessment and evaluated in this report .
can also .@@ indicate continuing high pressure or poor state of the environment .
inevitably , the information base for this assessment is more reliable for some areas than for others .
executive Summary atmospheric issues
target index ( year )
value in 1996 : 12 .
second CL@@ RT@@ AP sulphur protocol target .
first CL@@ RT@@ AP NO@@ x protocol target : stabil@@ ise at 1987 levels , EU target : 30 % from 1990 levels . 70 ( 2000 ) 105 ( 1994 ) 99 ( 1994 )
although this evaluation has been done for the whole area , targets are only valid for countries that are party in the conventions .
in Western Europe , these changes have been due mainly to the implementation of emission reduction policies and to structural changes in ind@@ vi@@ strial production and shifts to cleaner fuels .
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment
progress towards reduction targets for emissions to the air is shown in Table 2 .
despite the progress apparent from Table 2 , emissions of several pollutants need to be further reduced so that targets already agreed - and new ones in prospect - can be met .
most of the emission reductions achieved so far have resulted from economic change and measures directed at large sources in the industry and energy sectors .
there will clearly need to be action at all levels affecting all economic sectors if the Kyoto target is to be achieved .
similar reductions have been achieved in Europe .
this under@@ lines the importance of reducing emissions of remaining oz@@ one@@ depl@@ eting substances ( H@@ CF@@ Cs , meth@@ yl bro@@ mi@@ de ) , and of ensuring that existing measures are properly enforced so as to advance the date of recovery of the ozone layer .
emissions of nitrogen ox@@ ides and ammon@@ ia have fallen by 15 % .
however , for about 10 % of Europe 's land area the level of acid de@@ position is still too high .
this has resulted in the transport sector becoming the dominant contributor to emissions of nitrogen ox@@ ides .
the large potential for growth in private transport in CEE and in the NIS is likely to exacerbate the problem .
tro@@ pos@@ pheric ozone and summer smo@@ g
however , summer smo@@ g , caused by high tro@@ pos@@ pheric ozone concentrations , still occurs frequently in many European countries , posing a threat to human health and to vegetation .
this is expected to be ready for adoption in 1999 and will probably aim for more rigorous emission reductions .
in Eastern Europe , industry is still the main source of N@@ MV@@ OC emissions , but that situation could change with the expected increase in transport .
new instruments , such as voluntary red@@ vic@@ tion programmes and T@@ ox@@ ic Release Invent@@ ories / pollut@@ ant E@@ mission Regi@@ sters are gaining increasing attention .
however , part of the apparent increase may be the result of improved waste monitoring .
waste management in most countries continues to be dominated by the cheapest available option : land@@ fill .
waste minim@@ isation and prevention are being increasingly recognised as more desirable solutions for waste management , but no overall progress in this direction can yet be seen .
recycling tends to be more successful in countries with a strong waste management infrastructure .
parts of CEE and the NIS have the benefit of large trac@@ ts of relatively un@@ spoiled forests and other natural habitats .
inland and marine waters
the E@@ pe pays particular attention to sustainable management of natural resources , including inland , coastal and marine waters .
however , threats to all these remain .
although , in the past decade , water abstraction rates have been stable or have even decreased in a number of Western and Eastern European countries , potential water shortages persist , particularly around urban areas .
leak@@ ages from distribution systems in some countries , and inefficient water use in all countries continue to be problems .
groundwater quality - and , consequently , human health - are threatened by high concentrations of nit@@ rate from agriculture .
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment
since 1990 , there has been no overall improvement in river quality in Europe .
soil erosion and sal@@ in@@ isation remain serious problems in many areas , particularly around the Mediterranean .
little progress has been achieved in soil conservation , another area given particular attention in the E@@ pe .
a large number of contaminated sites are in need of remedi@@ ation .
currently , 300 000 potentially contaminated sites have been identified , mainly in Western Europe , particularly in areas with a long tradition of heavy industry .
in Eastern Europe , where there is a large number of contaminated military areas , better information is needed to as@@ certain the extent of the problem .
one positive development has been a growing interest by cities in the local Agenda 21 movement .
more than 2@@ 90 European cities have signed the A@@ al@@ borg Charter of European Cities and T@@ owns towards Sustain@@ ability .
implementation of local Agenda 21 policies and instruments , with their promise of significant improvement from concerted local action , is fast becoming the most crucial development in cities .
13 technological and natural hazards
this is due , in some cases , to natural time delays ( in processes such as strat@@ osph@@ eric ozone depletion or the build @@@ -@@ @ up of phosph@@ orus concentrations in lakes ) .
however , in many cases the measures taken have been too limited , given the scale and complexity of the problem ( for example , summer smo@@ g or pesticides in groundwater ) .
a traditional focus for European environmental policies has been the control of pollution at source and the protection of particular parts of the environment .
more rec@@ end@@ y , the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas and the promotion of sustainable development have come to the fore .
transport , energy , industry and agriculture are key sectoral " driving forces " di@@ at impact on Europe 's environment .
the development of environmental policies and their effective implementation varies widely between these sectors .
this report shows that some progress has been made on these limited objectives in most of Europe .
nevertheless , the continuing growth of traffic and transport infrastructure has resulted in an overall growth in transport @@@ -@@ @ related environmental problems and public concern about them .
this is now leading to more fundamental questioning of the link between economic development and the growth of traffic .
Rec@@ end@@ y , efforts are being made to restrain growth in the demand for transport , promote more use of public transport , and encourage new patterns of se@@ ul@@ ement and production which reduce the need for transport .
energy use , which is the basic driving force behind climate change and a number of air pollution problems , has remained at a consistently high level in Western Europe since the Dob@@ ris assessment .
climate change , aci@@ di@@ fication , summer smo@@ g , coastal and marine , urban problems
in CEE and the NIS , energy consumption has fallen by 23 % since 1990 as a result of economic restructuring , but is expected to rise again as economic recovery takes off .
greater efficiency in the production and use of energy is a key requirement of a more sustainable energy policy .
relatively low energy prices have not provided a sufficient stimulus for energy efficiency improvements in Western Europe .
so here , too , new measures to promote energy efficiency in the production and consumption of energy are likely to be needed .
industry : the relative contribution of industry to the problems of climate change , aci@@ di@@ fication , tro@@ pos@@ pheric ozone and water pollution has decreased since the Dob@@ ris assessment .
climate change , strat@@ osph@@ eric ozone , aci@@ di@@ fication , summer smo@@ g , chemicals , waste , water , coastal and marine , urban problems , accidents
in Western Europe , environmental objectives are becoming integrated into industrial decision @@@ -@@ @ making , resulting in falling total industrial emissions to air and water .
technological " le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gging " may occur when a significant part of the production system is renewed .
in all of Europe , the environmental impact of small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises is considerable , as is their potential for improvement .
in general , these enterprises are not yet being subjected to effective environmental measures .
agriculture : in the past , agricultural policies in Europe have generally been directed towards maxim@@ ising food production and maintaining farm incomes .
more recently , policies are beginning to direct more attention to environmental requirements and the need for more sustainable agriculture .
the report shows , however , that there is still a long way to go .

Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment
in Western Europe , yields have continued to increase in the past five years as a result of advances in agricultural practices .
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment
climate change European annual mean air temperatures have increased by 0.@@ 3@@ 0.6 ° C since 1900 .
climate models predict further increases , above 1990 levels , of about 2 ° C by the year 2100 , with higher increases in the north of Europe than in the south .
the potential consequences include increases in sea level , more frequent and intense storms , floods and droughts , and changes in bi@@ ota and food productivity .
in addition , there is scope for other types of measure to reduce CO , , emissions , some of which are currently being taken by various European countries and the EU .
in Western Europe , emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use fell by 3 % between 1990 and 1995 , due to economic recession , the restructuring of industry in Germany and the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation .
energy prices in Western Europe during the past decade have been stable and relatively low compared to historical prices , providing little incentive for improving efficiency .
energy intensity ( final energy consumption per unit of GDP ) has fallen by only 1 % per year since 1980 .
patterns of energy use changed markedly between 1980 and 1995 .
total energy consumption increased by 10 % between 1985 and 1995 .
in Eastern Europe , carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use fell by 19 % between 1990 and 1995 , mainly as a result of economic restructuring .
energy use for transport fell by 3 % in CEE over this period and by 48 % in the NIS .
annual emissions have also fallen rapidly .
note : the curve shows the projected mixing ratio ( frequency of occurrence ) of so @@@ -@@ @ called equivalent effective chlorine .
it is based on the Protocol scenario in the 1998 W@@ MO / UNEP ozone assessment , which assumes maximum allowed emissions within protocols .
source : R@@ IV@@ M , preliminary data from the W@@ MO 1998 ozone assessment .
these reductions are similar to , but less severe than , those observed over Antarctica and emphasi@@ se the need for continuing political attention to strat@@ osph@@ eric ozone depletion .
the vitality of many forests is still decreasing but , while this damage is not necessarily related to aci@@ di@@ fication , long@@ term effects of acid de@@ position on soils may be playing a role .
in sensitive areas , aci@@ di@@ fication leads to increased mobility of aluminium and heavy metals , causing groundwater pollution .
de@@ positions of aci@@ di@@ fying substances have decreased since about 1985 .
critical loads ( the levels of de@@ position above which long@@ term harmful effects can be expected ) are , however , still being exceeded in about 10 % of Europe 's land area , mainly in northern and central Europe .
emission of sulphur dioxide in Europe halved between 1980 and 1995 .
the transport sector has become the largest source of emissions of nitrogen ox@@ ides , contributing 60 % of the total in 1995 .
only an 8 % reduction was achieved by 1995 , and it does not appear likely that the 2000 target will be met .
a multi@@ pollut@@ ant , multi @@@ -@@ @ effect protocol is expected to be ready in 1999 .
however , several European countries ( for example , Portugal and Greece ) did not reduce their sulphur emissions in this period to the same extent .
achieving the interim target of the second sulphur protocol by 2000 is more uncertain , and further measures will be needed to achieve its long@@ term target , which is no exceed@@ ance of critical loads .
further measures aimed at reaching the long@@ term target of the second CL@@ RT@@ AP sulphur protocol are under development in the EU , following the 5@@ E@@ AP , including reducing the sulphur content

year @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ year meteorological variability prevents the detection of trends in the occurrence of episodes of high ozone concentration .
threshold concentrations , set for the protection of human health , vegetation and ecosystems , are frequ@@ end@@ y exceeded in most European countries .
about 330 million people in the EU may be exposed to at least one exceed@@ ance of the threshold per year .
the protection threshold for vegetation was exceeded in most EU countries in 1995 .
several countries reported exceed@@ ances for more than 150 days at some sites .
in the same year , almost the entire EU area of forest and arable land experienced exceed@@ ances .
emissions of the most important ozone precur@@ sors , nitrogen ox@@ ides and non@@ methane volatile organic compounds ( N@@ MV@@ O@@ Cs ) , increased until the late 1980s and then fell by 14 % between 1990 and 1994 .
the transport sector is the main contributor of nitrogen ox@@ ides .
transport is also the main contributor to emissions of N@@ MV@@ O@@ Cs in Western Europe , while in CEE and the NIS , industry is the main contributor .
daily summer maximum concentrations of ozone
achieving the long@@ term target of no exceed@@ ance of threshold levels will depend critically on reducing overall tro@@ pos@@ pheric ozone concentrations .
this will require measures on emissions of the precur@@ sor ' pollutants ( nitrogen ox@@ ides and N@@ MV@@ O@@ Cs ) covering the whole of the northern hemisphere .
chemicals Since the Dob@@ ris assessment , the chemical industry in Western Europe has continued to grow , with production since 1993 growing faster than GDP .
production in CEE and the NIS has fallen markedly since 1989 , in line with the fall in GDP , but since 1993 production has partially recovered in some countries .
the net result is that the flows of chemicals through the economy throughout Europe have increased .
data on emissions is scarce , but chemicals are widespread in all environmental media , including animal and human tissues .
the European Invent@@ ory of Ex@@ ist@@ ing Chemical Sub@@ stances lists over 100 000 chemical compounds .
some information , however , is available - for example , on heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants ( PO@@ Ps ) .
although emissions of some of these substances are falling , concentrations in the environment remain of concern , particularly in some highly contaminated areas and sinks like the Arctic and Baltic Sea .
although some well @@@ -@@ @ known PO@@ Ps are being phased out , many others with similar properties are still being produced in large amounts .
the UNECE is expected to fin@@ alise two new protocols on emissions to air of three heavy metals and sixteen PO@@ Ps under the Convention on Long @@@ -@@ @ Range Trans@@ boundary Air Poll@@ ution in 1998 .
note : * data refers to change between 1990 and 1995
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment
there is scope for a wider application of such instruments in all parts of Europe .
waste Re@@ ported total waste generation in OECD Europe increased by nearly 10 % between 1990 and 1995 .
however , part of the apparent increase may be the result of improved waste monitoring and reporting .
lack of harmon@@ isation and incomplete data collection continue to make it difficult to monitor trends and improve the targeting of waste policy initiatives across Europe .
municipal waste generation is estimated to have increased by 11 % in OECD European countries between 1990 and 1995 .
approximately 200 million tonnes of municipal waste was generated in 1995 , equivalent to 420 kg / person / year .
data on municipal waste for CEE countries and the NIS are not sufficiently robust to enable the determination of an underlying trend .
Germany and France were the largest contributors to the approximately 42 million tonnes per year of hazardous waste reported by OECD European countries for the period around 1994 .
the Russian Federation accounted for about two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the 30 million tonnes of hazardous waste generated per year by the whole of Eastern Europe during the early 1990s .
these totals are only indicative because of differences in definition .
waste management in most countries continues to be dominated by the cheapest available option : land@@ fill .
waste prevention and minim@@ isation are being increasingly recognised as environmentally more desirable solutions for waste management .
recycling is increasing in countries with strong waste management infrastructures .
many countries in CEE and the NIS face the problems of a legacy of poor waste management and increases in waste generation .
waste management in these countries requires better strategic planning and more investment .
some Central European countries are beginning to adopt similar approaches , prompted by the EU accession process .
however , waste legislation is still poorly developed in most other CEE countries and in the NIS .
share of countries with the following instruments in waste policy
targets for recovery / recycling
targets for prevention
in many countries , up to half of the known ver@@ tebr@@ ate species are under threat .
this is mainly caused by damage to their habitats by land @@@ -@@ @ use changes , particularly through intensi@@ fication of agriculture and forestry , increasing infrastructure development , water abstraction and pollution .
the introduction of alien species is causing problems in marine , inland water and terrestrial habitats .
wet@@ land loss is greatest in southern Europe , but major losses are also occurring in many agricultural and urban@@ ised areas in north @@@ -@@ @ western and central Europe .
the main causes are land re@@ clamation , pollution , drainage , recreation and urban@@ isation .
some large and many minor restoration projects in rivers , lakes , bo@@ gs and mi@@ res are , to some extent , compens@@ ating for these losses , though mostly on a small scale .
the extent of sand dun@@ es has fallen by 40 % this century , mainly in along the western shores of Europe ; a third of the loss has occurred since mid 1970s .
the main causes are urban@@ isation , recreational use and forest plantation .
the total area of forest is increasing , as is total timber production .
" extensive " forest management , formerly the most common practice , continues to be replaced by more intensive and uniform management .
the use of exotic species is still increasing .
the severe loss of old natural and semi @@@ -@@ @ natural wood@@ lands has continued .
most of the old and almost untouched forests are now to be found in CEE and the NIS , although smaller areas still exist elsewhere .
forest fires are still a problem around the Mediterranean , though there has been a decrease in the area affected .
the concept of sustainable forestry is beginning to be introduced in forest use and management , but general effects on biodiversity have yet to be seen .
as agriculture has become more intensive and aff@@ ore@@ station has continued in low @@@ -@@ @ yielding areas , semi @@@ -@@ @ natural agricultural habitats such as meadows are rapidly being lost or degraded .
these habitats were formerly very widespread in Europe and depended on extensive agricultural management with low inputs of nutrients .
they now suffer from excessive nutrient input and aci@@ di@@ fication .
with the disappearance of their often very rich plant and animal life , the natural biodiversity of the open landscape has severely diminished .
a wide range of initiatives and legal instruments for the protection of species and habitats has been introduced internationally and nationally in all countries .
strategic Environmental Assess@@ ments for policies and programmes , together with nature conservation instruments , can be important tools for enhancing such integration .
however , demand around urban areas may still exceed availability and , in the near future , water shortages may occur .
future water supply may also be affected by climate change .
agriculture is the most important user of water in Mediterranean coun@@ u@@ ies , mainly for irrigation .
the area under irrigation and the abstraction of water for irrigation have been rising steadily since 1980 .
in southern European countries , 60 % of all water abstr@@ acted is used for irrigation .
in some regions , groundwater abstraction is exceeding the re@@ charge rate , causing lowering of the groundwater table , loss of wet@@ lands and sea@@ water intrusion .
tools for limiting future demand for water include improvements in the efficiency of water use , price controls and agricultural policy .
despite the introduction of water quality targets in the EU and the attention to water quality in the Environmental Action
programme for Central and Eastern Europe , there has been no overall improvement of river quality since 1989 / 90 .
European countries report different trends without any consistent geographical pattern .

phosph@@ orus and nitrogen continue to cause eut@@ roph@@ ication of surface waters .
phosph@@ orus concentrations in surface waters decreased significantly , particularly in those previously most severely affected .
further improvements are expected since the recovery time , particularly of lakes , may be several years .
phosph@@ orous concentrations at about a quarter of the river monitoring sites are still about ten times higher than those in water of good quality .
nitrogen , of which the main source is agriculture , is less
Europe 's Environment : the Second Assessment of a problem in rivers , but can cause problems when transported to the sea ; emissions need to be further controlled to protect the marine environment .
groundwater quality is affected by increasing concentrations of nit@@ rate and pesticides from agriculture .
nit@@ rate concentrations are low in northern Europe , but high in several Western and Eastern countries , with frequent exceed@@ ances of the EU maximum admissible concentration .
the application of pesticides in die EU fell between 1985 and 1995 , but this does not necessarily indicate a decrease in environmental impact since the range of pesticides in use has changed .
groundwater concentr@@ ado ns of certain pesticides frequ@@ end@@ y exceed EU maximum admissible concentrations .
significant pollution from heavy metals , hydrocarbons and chlor@@ inated hydrocarbons has also been reported from many countries .
integrated pol@@ ices for the protection of inland waters are in place in many areas of Europe , for example around the North Sea , the Baltic Sea , the Rhine , the El@@ be and the Danube .
although much has been achieved , better integration of environmental policies with economic policies remains a challenge for the future .
the proposal for a Water Framework Directive will require integrated programmes of management and improvement .
eut@@ roph@@ ication , mainly resulting from nutrient surpluses in agriculture , is of major concern in some parts of many European seas .
nutrient concentrations are generally at the same level as in the beginning of the 1990s .
increases in nitrogen dis@@ charges and resulting concentrations in sea water on some of the west co@@ asts of Europe seem to be correlated with high precipitation and flooding between 1994 and 1996 .
in most other seas , no clear trend in nutrient concentrations could be identified .
however , concentrations of nutrients in the Black Sea , mainly originating from the Danube watershed , increased about ten@@ fold between 1960 and 1992 .
contamination of se@@ di@@ ments and bi@@ ota by anthropo@@ genic chemicals seems to be common in almost all European seas .
only limited data was available , mainly covering western and north @@@ -@@ @ western Europe .
elevated concentrations ( above natural background ) of heavy metals and PC@@ Bs have been found in fish and se@@ diment , with high levels near point sources of emission .
bio @@@ -@@ @ accumulation of these substances may pose a threat to ecosystems and human health ( as discussed in the chapter on chemicals ) .
the overall picture of oil pollution is highly fragm@@ entary , and no reliable assessment of general trends can be made .
the main source is from land , reaching the seas through rivers .
there is a critical over capacity in the fishing fleet , and a reduction of 40 % in capacity would be needed to match available fish resources .

soil degradation Over 300 000 potentially contaminated sites have been identified in Western Europe , and the estimated total number in Europe is much greater .
although the Environmental Programme for Europe called for the identification of contaminated sites , a complete overview is not yet available for many countries .
the extent of the problem is difficult to assess because of the lack of agreed definitions .
the European Commission is preparing a White Paper on environmental liability ; follow @@@ -@@ @ up actions might require agreed definitions .
most Western European countries have established regulatory frameworks aimed at preventing future incidents and cleaning up existing contamination .
in Eastern Europe , soil contamination around abandoned milit@@ ai@@ y bases poses the most serious risk .
the majority of the countries in the region have started to assess the problems involved .
however , many CEE countries and the NIS have still to develop the regulatory and financial framework needed for dealing with contaminated sites .
another severe problem is soil loss through sealing under constructions , such as industrial premises and transport infrastructure , reducing soil use options for future generations .
soil erosion is increasing .
about 115 million hectares are suffering from water erosion and 42 million hectares from wind erosion .
the problem is greatest in the Mediterranean region because of its fragile environmental conditions , but problems exist in most European countries .
soil erosion is intensified by land aband@@ onment and forest fires , particularly in marginal areas .
strategies , such as aff@@ ore@@ station , for combating accelerated soil erosion are lacking in many areas .
soil sal@@ in@@ isation is affecting nearly 4 million hectares , mainly in Mediterranean and Eastern European countries .
the main effects in cultivated areas are lower crop yields and even total crop failure .

urban@@ isation is continuing , despite the fact that around thre@@ equ@@ ar@@ ters of the population of Western Europe and the NIS , and slightly less than two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of@@ that in CEE , already live in cities .
the rapid increase in private transport and resource @@@ -@@ @ intensive consumption are major threats to the urban environment and , consequently , to human health and welfare .
in many cities , cars now provide over 80 % of mechan@@ ised transport .
the current growth in urban mobility and car ownership in CEE cities is expected to accelerate during the next decade , with corresponding increases in energy consumption and transport @@@ -@@ @ related emissions .
overall , air quality in most European cities has improved .
annual lead concentrations dropped sharply in the 1990s because of the reduction in the lead content of petrol , and there seems to be evidence that concentrations of other pollutants are also falling .
however , a few CEE cities have reported small increases in lead concentrations during the past five years , due to the increase in traffic .
ozone remains a major problem in some cities , however , with high concentrations occurring during the whole of the summer .
a majority of@@ cities providing data report exceed@@ ances of WHO guid@@ eline values for sulphur dioxide , carbon mon@@ oxide , nitrogen ox@@ ides and particul@@ ate matter ( PM ) .
little data was available on ben@@ z@@ ene , but exceed@@ ance of WHO air quality guid@@ eline values seems common .
extrapol@@ ation of the reported results to all 115 large cities of Europe suggests that about 25 million people are exposed to winter smo@@ g conditions ( exceed@@ ances of air quality guidelines for SO , , and PM ) .
the corresponding number of people exposed to summer smo@@ g conditions ( related to ozone ) is 37 million , with nearly 40 million people experiencing at least one exceed@@ ance of the WHO guidelines every year .
about 450 million people in Europe ( 65 % of the population ) are exposed to high environmental noise levels ( above Equi@@ valent Sound Pres@@ sure Lev@@ els ( Le@@ q ) 24@@ h 55@@ d@@ B ( A ) ) .
about 9.@@ 7 million people are exposed to unacceptable noise levels ( above Le@@ q 24@@ h 75@@ d@@ B ( A ) ) .
several cities in northern Europe , however , decreased their water consumption .
in general , the water resource could be more effectively used , since only a small percentage of domestic water use is for drinking or cooking , and large amounts ( 5 % to over 25 % ) are lost by leakage .
6 % l by a factor two or more H
32 % below guid@@ eline value
in spite of progress in setting up environmental manag@@ em@@ entin European cities , many problems remain unresolved .
more than 2@@ 90 cities have al@@ read@@ y@@ joined the European Sustainable Cities and T@@ owns Campaign .

exceptionally large numbers of floods have occurred during the 1990s , causing much damage and many deaths .
while the most likely explanation is natural variations in water flow , the effects may have been ampli@@ fied by human impacts on the hydro@@ logical cycle .

energy hand@@ book for teachers in Moldova The hand@@ book was distributed to each of the secondary schools in Moldova , a circulation of around 3,000 copies .
it provides each school with a unique reference book on the topic of energy and includes many suggestions for teachers on how to present the material to their students .
1996 @@@ -@@ @ 1997 State Department of Energy and Ministry of Education in Moldova and schools across the country .
some information on this brochure
this brochure has been extensively developed from the hand@@ book produced in the T@@ AD@@ S project in Moldova .
here , the reference material has been consolidated and a greater emphasis has been placed upon suggestions for active and modern teaching exercises .
the revision and additional material has been provided by two consulting firms , ET@@ SU and fiel@@ d@@ work , both from UK .
use To provide teachers with key information and practical teaching suggestions to help them build energy into existing school curricula .
energy is an important topic throughout the school curriculum .
however , It has tradition ­ ally been covered In subjects such as physics , mathematics and chemistry .
this sci@@ ence@@ based approach can disguise the social , economic and political issues that are intim@@ ately linked to the understanding of energy .
this hand@@ book is intended to help you , as a teacher , present a broad and compreh@@ en ­ sive understanding of energy to students .
the approach proposed in this brochure encourages students to question and debate how energy affects their lives .
it helps them to understand the strategic Import@@ ance of a country 's energy reserves and the political and economic problems that might result from a lack of adequate energy resources .
social and economic development is so closely tied to energy @@@ -@@ @ related Issues that any industrial , economic , political or social study requires a clear understanding of the underlying energy situation of a country .
the hand@@ book is therefore intended to show the importance of energy In a global context .
this hand@@ book provides reference information and teaching suggestions .
it Is intended to complement existing sc@@ i ­ ence curricula and is aimed at students aged 12 @@@ -@@ @ 15 years .
the hand@@ book has a broad scope Inclu@@ ding the origins of energy , the sources and extraction of fossil fuels , nuclear power , electricity generation and transmission , and the use of energy In society .
it encourages active teaching by getting students to carry out investigative studies In@@ to energy topics and to challenge and debate the underlying Issues .
the hand@@ book has been written with a structure enabling you to quickly Identi@@ fy the main themes of individual sections , the information presented for reference and the sugg@@ es ­ tions for teaching activities .
additional topics which are interesting and per@@ tinent to E@@ ner ­ gy have been presented as optional .
each section Is presented in the same format : • Main themes • Key Information • Optional topics • Su@@ gg@@ ested activities .
for example , In the section Why energy is Import@@ ant you could present the first theme as an objective - ' St@@ u ­ dents should understand the significance of energy in mankind 's social and industrial development ' .
some of the exercises have been developed in detail , others provide suggestions that you can expand further for use in class .
the more detailed suggestions Inclu@@ de a role playing exercise relating to the proposed construction of a nuclear power station in the neighbourhood and undertaking an energy audit project within the school .
why energy is important
main themes of this chapter
key information
the ability to harness different forms of energy as fuel has been central to mankind 's development since pre@@ historic times .
stone Age man used wood fires to heat caves , for cooking and to har@@ den wooden hunting weapons .
later , In the Bron@@ ze and Iron Ages , fire was used to shape metal weapons and implements .
char@@ coal provided the higher tem ­ per@@ atures needed for melting metals .
in the 18th and 19th centuries , industrial development was driven by the use of coal to sm@@ elt Iron for engineering structures - buildings , bridges and the first iron boats .
even today developments in energy use continue to shape our lives .
energy - a finite resource ?
today 's society relies on a number of naturally occurring energy reserves called the ' pr@@ i ­ Mary energy resources ' .
the most Import@@ ant are the fossil fuels ( coal , oil and natural gas ) .
uranium , used as the fuel In nuclear power stations , and renewable energies ( Inclu@@ ding hydropower , solar , wind and ge@@ other@@ mal power ) are also primary energies .
fossil fuels make up the largest share of our energy resources ( Figure 1 ) .
but they are finite .
however as the most accessible reserves are located and used up , extraction has to operate In more hazardous , remote and technically difficult environments .
these problems increase the cost of extraction .
figure 1 : primary energy use in the world ( 1994 )
biomass 14 %
natural gas 21 %
coal 24 %
the social and economic development of any country depends upon the strength and prosperity of Its industry and other means of economic production such as agriculture and tourism .
it also depends upon good transport and communication infrastructure , and other factors including education and health @@@ -@@ @ care .
adequate and secure energy resources are fundamental to sustaining this development and to maintaining trade and political relations with other countries .
countries with limited primary energy reserves either have to exploit their own sources at high cost , or to purchase energy from other countries .
fossil fuel resources are also a very important source from which other products are derived .
oil , gas and coal are the main source of secondary products such as pe@@ tro ­ chemicals , organic chemicals , plastics and fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers .
processing of primary fuels and the industries associated with these secondary products are major sources of employment for countries with Indigenous fossil fuel resources .
why energy is important
optional topic - Energy has many different forms
energy surrounds us in many different forms .
the food we eat contains energy ( mea ­ sured in kil@@ o calories or kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les ) which enables the body to function , to keep warm , to move around .
it also enables us to apply energy to other objects , such as lifting a heavy box or ped@@ alling a bicycle .
light and sound are both forms of energy .
consider striking a match : the chemical E@@ ner ­ gy within the match head is released as heat , a visible flame and the sound of the match ign@@ iting .
electricity is another form of energy which Is so useful because it can be converted eas@@ i ­ ly .
consider the many applications of electricity in daily life e.g. lighting , heating , Tel@@ ev@@ i ­ sions , telephone , refriger@@ ators etc .
explain the principle - " Energy can neither be created nor destroyed , merely transformed into different forms . "
discuss simple everyday activities with the students and consider where the energy flows are , e.g. striking a nail with a hammer or driving a car .
explain the relationships between potential and k@@ ine@@ tic energy .
consider a falling object : potential energy Is converted into k@@ ine@@ tic energy as it drops and g@@ athers speed .
provide students with a circus of mini @@@ -@@ @ experiments to illustrate how energy is converted from one form into another .
these might Inclu@@ de the following .
a cut away car battery which students can examine .
an inclined plane with model cars .
and many others ...
impact on the environment
fossil fuels can be very poll@@ uting - In their extraction , transport and final combustion In the power station , Industrial boiler or domestic home ( Figure 2 ) .
coal mining Is largely carried out In massive open cast mines causing major changes to the landscape and pollution of ground water and underground water courses by wash@@ ings from the coal ore .
oil Is largely transported by boat ( oil tan@@ ker ) and oil spills from damaged or wrec@@ ked ships has been responsible for devastation of local ecosystems and coastal wildlife In many areas .
air pollution caused by Industrial and transport activities , as well as gas pipelines leak and the natural gas ( methane ) released contributes to climate change .
perhaps the most visible environmental effect of fossil fuels Is in their combustion .
without modern pollut@@ ant ab@@ at@@ ement systems coal power stations release smoke , ash and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide , nit@@ ric ox@@ ides and heavy metals .
dispersed from high chim@@ neys these pollutants spread over great distances , frequently crossing country boundaries .
why energy is important
figure 2 : fossil fuel combustion is a major cause of air and water pollution
energy w@@ ast@@ age
a large part of the primary energy used today Is squandered and wasted .
this occurs at all stages of the cycle , from the extraction of primary fuel , conversion to electricity , distr@@ i ­ bu@@ tion through the electricity network and finally in Its end @@@ -@@ @ use .
this w@@ ast@@ age comes from the technologies we use but also from the way we use them .
generally society has a poor appreciation of the Import@@ ance and possibilities of reducing our energy use .
the best way to extend limited energy resources Is simple - by consuming less energy .
insti@@ l@@ ling the idea of the rational use of energy in students is a priority in teach ­ ing .
why energy is Import@@ ant
suggested activities ­ Why energy is important φ
initiate group discussions about the distribution of the world 's energy resources .
these discussions should be based upon up to date information gathered by students from newspapers , television programmes , radio pro ­ gram@@ mes , databases , the Internet , etc .
prepare a sheet of world energy stati@@ s ­ tics to give out to students to inform the discussions .
encourage groups of students to compile lists of questions about the distribution of the world 's E@@ ner ­ gy resources , then to research answers to the questions with Information from a library , databases or the Internet .
groups of students could investigate different issues , countries or regions of the world .
the output from the discussions could be poster displays , spoken presentations , video or audio tapes .
get students to construct energy time lines for their town or for the country .
an energy time line is a long sheet of paper set out with the centuries marked along a scale rather like a graph .
some may extend around the class ­ room and out along the corridor !
the dates of key events are marked together with drawings depic@@ ting the event .
an energy time line might include events such as the opening of a coal mine , the first street lighting , the first cars , the arrival of m@@ ains electricity etc .
students would collect information for their time lines by Inter@@ viewing local officials or older relatives , or by collecting information from local newspaper archives .
try plo@@ tting a national energy time line and comparing it one for the town .
other options are to show key events In national or local history or to plot a science and technology time line@@ 1 .
make energy maps of the country with the students drawing in the positions of energy resources and Infrastructure .
include : fuel reserves ( oil , coal , gas ­ fields ) , major pipelines and electrical transmission lines , power stations , Industrial and urban areas of energy demand , fuel and electricity Im@@ ports and exports .
organise a visit to a local coal mine , power station or other energy fac@@ il ­ ity .
alternatively , personnel from these enterprises could be invited to visit the school and talk to the students about their work .
get students to draw up San@@ key diagram ( Figure 3 ) showing the energy flows through a process or activity .
consider a power station , house or car .

main themes of this chapter
this chapter is structured in three parts , each with themes , key Information and suggest ­ ed activities .
figure 4 : the earth provides us with many natural sources of energy
key information
the fossil fuels were formed from the remains of plants and animals from many millions of years ago .
through the actions of micro @@@ -@@ @ organisms and particular conditions of Im@@ men@@ se temperature and pressure , these remains have been transformed into carbon deposits trapped within the ground or deep beneath the oceans .
the time @@@ -@@ @ scale of this process is so huge , compared to that of mankind 's development , that the reserves are considered to be finite and our continued extraction will ultimately depl@@ ete known reserves completely .
predictions of oil and gas resources Indic@@ ate they will last for around another 40 years .
new deposits are continually being located , but energy demand Is also Incre@@ asing and predictions of how long known reserves will last have remained approximately static since the 1960s .
known coal reserves are much larger and are predicted to last up to two thousand years .
fossil fuels are not only Import@@ ant for their energetic value but also as the raw material for many products of everyday life .
the tar and bit@@ umen used to construct the road Is also derived from fossil fuels .
what is oil ?
when oil Is extracted from the ground it Is called " crude oil . "
these deposits became trapped between Im@@ per@@ me ­ able layers of rock , and tec@@ tonic movement and geological faul@@ ting leads to the formation of underground reservoirs of oil , called oil @@@ -@@ @ fields .
exploration and extraction
detecting oil @@@ -@@ @ fields is a complicated and expensive process .
there ¡ s a ver / high degree of uncertainty and only 1 in 10 of the explor@@ ations are typically successful .
the expense of oil exploration can only be afforded by a handful of major International companies who now dominate the oil Industry .
modern detection Is highly scientific involving ge@@ ophysical methods including seismic , magnetic , electrical resistance and gravitational techniques .
these techniques provide evidence for the location of an oil @@@ -@@ @ field however pilot drilling wells are required to confirm the precise location , oil quality and Import@@ ance of disco@@ v ­ ered oil fields .
nowadays oil extraction is carried out both on land and out at sea .
these off @@@ -@@ @ shore Loc@@ a ­ tions use drilling platforms or oil @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ gs and the process is more complicated and haz ­ ardous .
over half of the crude oil extracted in the world Is from off @@@ -@@ @ shore locations .
as the most easily accessed fields are found and exploited , oil companies must search further , and deeper , for new oil @@@ -@@ @ fields .
already dr@@ ill@@ ings of 4000 metres and even up to 8000 metres in depth are normal both on land and off @@@ -@@ @ shore .
once the explor@@ atory and preparatory phase Is completed ( typically three years or more ) and the project assessed as economically viable , the bore is prepared for the extraction of oil .
the most Import@@ ant use of refined oil , besides that for energy , is as transport fuel for cars , lor@@ ries , trains and aero@@ planes .
it has many other extremely valuable components whose derivatives are separated out from crude oil In the distil@@ lation process .
this tech ­ ni@@ que works using a distil@@ lation column with graduated temperatures at which the various components , or fr@@ actions , of oil are separated out , conden@@ sed and collected .
initial refining releases asph@@ al@@ ts , lubric@@ ants , comb@@ ustible fuels and raw materials for the pe@@ tro @@@ -@@ @ chem@@ l@@ cal Industry .
ask students to identify items in the classroom ( or home ) that have been derived from oil products .
think of alternative materials that might have been used .
discuss the Import@@ ance of petro@@ chemicals to modern society .
create life @@@ -@@ @ cycle charts , get students to produce flow charts of the pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion processes In@@ vol@@ ved In the conversion of oil into everyday objects .
indicate the amount of energy used at each stage .
groups of students could be given different objects to Investig@@ ate , each made from different materials , I.@@ e. PVC , poly@@ th@@ ene , poly@@ prop@@ ylene , etc .
stage an exhibition of their charts as posters at the end of the task and discuss the similarities and differences between the processes .
ask each group to contribute questions about their exhibit to a class qui@@ z .
show a laboratory distil@@ lation experiment .
illustrate the frac@@ tional distil@@ lation process which takes place in an oil refinery using a laboratory distil@@ lation column .
students can examine the fr@@ actions obtained and see how they differ from the original fluid from which they came .
where oil is found
proved world oil reserves are calculated at 14 billion tonnes , with the actual resource being considerably larger .
proved reserves are the quantities of oil that are known to be in place and are considered to be economically recover@@ able with present technologies .
the world distribution of proved oil reserves is shown in the chart ( Figure 6 ) .
figure 6 : distribution of proved world oil reserves
although world trade In oil is governed by international agreements between countries and multinational companies , possession of oil reserves remains a very Import@@ ant str@@ ate ­ G@@ IC strength .
control of the distribution channels for oil Is also strategically very important .
examples include the pipelines from Russian oil @@@ -@@ @ fields to Western European countries and the shipping trade routes of the Su@@ ez Canal in Africa and the Panama Canal in Central America .
figure 7 : world trade routes for distribution of oil and petroleum
natural gas is colour@@ less , od@@ our@@ less gas comprising largely methane and small quantities of other hydrocarbons such eth@@ ane and pro@@ pane .
it is an extremely convenient and ver ­ sati@@ le fuel which is easily extracted .
it burns with very little pollution and Is distributed through a pipeline network to the final point of use .
it can be used directly within the home , or industry , and there is little requirement for storage .
the use of natural gas as a primary fuel is relatively recent , as for many years gas was seen as a necessary by @@@ -@@ @ product from the extraction of crude oil .
from 1960 , as pipelines and local gas transmission networks have been constructed , the growth in demand for natural gas has been spectacular .
now gas supplies over 30 % of the world 's total E@@ ner ­ gy demand .
like oil , natural gas is an important raw material for the pe@@ tro @@@ -@@ @ chem@@ l@@ cal industry and Is used to obtain a multitude of products including ammon@@ ia , ( for nitrogen fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers ) and meth@@ anol ( the basis of many plastics and other synthetic materials ) .
origins and extraction
natural gas is often found together with crude oil deposits and is formed by similar processes .
it is also produced by the degradation of older carbon deposits , such as coal .
as crude oil reserves are extracted , natural gas accumul@@ ates in the upper Cha@@ m ­ bers of the se@@ am and can be recovered once the extraction of crude is no longer viable .
in this type of gas field , quantities of pro@@ pane and but@@ ane are also recovered which are utilis@@ ed for domestic and industrial use as L@@ PG ( liquid pro@@ pane gas ) .
natural gas is also found In dry se@@ ams , not in association with oil , as in the extensive Russian and NIS region gas fields . detection and extraction techniques are similar to those for oil .
wells are typically 5000 metres deep , or more , and are lined to reduce con ­ tam@@ ination .
natural gas often has to be transported great distances from the gas fields to the demand centres .
two methods are used : • by ship , carried as liquid methane at around 160 ° C below zero • pumped through large diameter pipelines .
pipeline technology has played a key role in the development of markets for natural gas .
gas has to be transported vast distances , often across continents , and users require stability in pressure and continuous supply .
large diameter pipes ( up to around 4@@ m ) are used to minimise pressure , yet the cost of the pipe Incre@@ ases quickly with pipe size and intermediate pumping stations are required .
nowadays , gas pipelines even cross stra@@ its joining continents , like that of Gibraltar which ensures the supply of gas from Algeria to Europe .
major pipelines bring gas from Russia and Scandinavia into Western and Central Europe and others supply the USA and Central America from the Canadian fields .
a major pipeline project is currently underway In Latin America to bring gas from the An@@ des in the West of the continent , across the Amazon Basin to supply the industrial regions of Brazil In the East .
the large liquid gas distribution centres are in the Mediterranean ( Algeria and Libya ) , the Pacific Ri@@ m ( Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia and Alaska ) and NIS countries .
the Russian and other NIS gas fields produce around half of the world 's present gas demand .
other major fields are in the Middle East and North Sea .
coal provided the energy to fuel the industrial revolution in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .
it was relatively simple to mine and required little preparation .
the importance of coal diminished with the discovery of oil , and many applic@@ a ­ tions switched towards this more convenient and economical fuel .
however , the oil crises of the 1970s and the relative abundance of coal has restored the balance and coal will remain a very significant fuel well into the future .
the main uses of coal today are : • as fuel in ther@@ mo @@@ -@@ @ electric power stations • within the iron and steel industry , both as raw material for coke and as a fuel for sm@@ elt ­ ing and heating processes .
before the exploitation of natural gas , coal was widely used to generate ' town gas ' for urban use .
like oil and gas it also provides raw materials for the petrochemical industry .
composition of coal
coal ¡ s a solid , black carbon material with varying amounts different minerals which form in@@ ert resi@@ dues ( ash ) when the coal is burnt .
it also contains volatile hydrocarbons and other im@@ pur@@ ities e.g. sulphur .
how coal is formed
as seas advanced and rec@@ eded over the land , successive layers of plant material and se@@ diment were built up .
there are two approaches : • open @@@ -@@ @ cast mining - where coal se@@ ams are horizontal and relatively near the surface .
this Is inexpensive , yet coal se@@ ams tend to be of lower purity and quality • deep shaft mining - where vertical and horizontal sha@@ fts are used to access the coal face deep underground .
deep shaft mining gives access to better quality coal se@@ ams but is more expensive than open cast mining and in the past has been a very haz ­ ardous industry .
the coal is extracted using mechanical cutting machines or with controlled explosives .
in deep mining the se@@ ams used to be worked by hand in narrow galleries .
now where the se@@ am is of sufficient thickness and regularity the coal face can be worked by sophistic@@ at ­ ed machines which cut the coal and transport It back to the vertical sha@@ fts in automated w@@ agons .
at the surface the extracted coal has to be separated from in@@ ert rock material .
this is achieved through a series of mechanical size classification processes and flo@@ at@@ ation techniques .
coal is transported by rail and ship .
show the coal face galleries , the vertical lift sha@@ fts , the venti@@ la ­ tion sha@@ fts and other features which demonstrate its workings .
students could write short descriptions or stories of a day @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ life of a min@@ er .
compare the lifestyle of a min@@ er In the early part of the 20th century with a min@@ er working in a modern coal mine .
mining - a dangerous industry
coal mining is a hazardous industry which has been made vastly safer through the appl@@ i ­ c@@ ation of modern and sophisticated machinery .
however , it still requires working deep underground in tightly controlled spaces with the inherent risks of roof collapse , expl@@ o ­ sion , flooding and the harmful effects of a dust lad@@ en atmosphere .
explosion presents a very significant risk .
methane gas becomes trapped in pockets within the coal and in suitable mixture with air ( around 5 % ) , can be ign@@ ited by a spark with catastrophic con@@ se ­ qu@@ ences .
other less immediate dangers are the continued exposure to coal dust which can cause bron@@ chi@@ al diseases in mine workers , the most well known being ' sil@@ ic@@ osis ' .
figure 8 : typical deep @@@ -@@ @ shaft mine , showing the coal face and working galleries and sha@@ fts
coal contains ash and im@@ pur@@ ities ( sulphur , heavy metals and others ) that are released on combustion and are damaging to the environment .
coal power stations use washed coal which contains less dust and organic matter .
the coal is generally pul@@ ver@@ ised and blown into the combustion chamber to ign@@ ite and com ­ bust efficiently in a specially designed burner .
ash and clin@@ ker is collected from the base of boiler and particul@@ ate dust Is removed from the exhaust gases using an electro@@ static precipitation filter .
this is simply a large chamber filled with vertically hanging wires which have a small electrical charge to which the dust particles are attracted .
more sophisticated and modern power stations will also have fl@@ ue @@@ -@@ @ gas des@@ ul@@ ph@@ ur@@ isation units which will sc@@ rub out emissions of S@@ 0@@ 2@@ from the exhaust .
this process has become increasingly Import@@ ant due to the effects of acid rain resulting from power station em@@ is ­ sions and the increasing cost of high quality ( low sulphur ) coal .
cleaner coal technologies currently being developed will g@@ asi@@ fy the coal rather than use direct combustion .
the gas can be fired directly In@@ to a gas turbine which will raise efficiency .
another benefit of g@@ asi@@ fi ­ c@@ ation is that the gas can be cleaned of Imp@@ urities prior to combustion .
coal reserves are found all over the world .
Europe has a long tradition of coal mining , but due to a reliance on expensive deep shaft mining the industry has contracted rapidly In the past twenty years .
Eastern Europe , Russia and Ukraine are still major coal producers and exporters .
the newest coal producers are countries such as Colombia , Australia , Canada and South Africa which operate massive open @@@ -@@ @ cast mines and export a high proportion of their output .
China , India and Korea have extensive coal resources but export little as it is needed to provide for their internal consumption .
present estimates of world coal resources are around 10 million million tonnes which would satisfy the world 's present energy demand for 2000 years .
although coal seems to present a long term solution to man 's energy needs , coal combustion has major impacts on local and global environments .
research In@@ to cleaner coal technologies may provide solutions which can satis@@ factor@@ ily reduce the environmental effects associated with present coal usage .
organise a project amongst groups of St@@ u ­ dents into the issues relating to the transport of fossil fuels such great distances around the world .
one group might look at the distribution of energy resources and energy demand across the world .
another group the energy costs of trans ­ porting fuels by bar@@ ge , rail road or pipeline .
another might consider the en@@ vir@@ on ­ mental risks associated with different forms of transporting fossil fuels .
investigate the effects of oil on water and fe@@ athers .
students can examine the fine structure of fe@@ athers using a hand lens or magni@@ fying glass .
wet the fe@@ athers with water and re @@@ -@@ @ examine .
repeat with engine oil .
find out whether o@@ iled fe@@ athers float as well as clean ones .
investigate the floating property of oil and the effects of dispers@@ ants such as deter@@ gent .
this should lead to better understanding of the properties of oil and the effects of sp@@ ill@@ age on sea birds ( loss of insulation , water resistance and ing@@ estion of oil through pre@@ ening ) .
combustion of coal and oil releases sulphur di@@ ox@@ ides and nitrogen ox@@ ides into the atmosphere .
the pollution and aci@@ di@@ fication resulting from these atmos@@ ph@@ er ­ ic pollutants can have serious effects on plant growth and decay of stone build ­ ings .
the following suggestions each consider the effects of atmospheric pollution .
sodium met@@ ab@@ is@@ ul@@ ph@@ l@@ te tablets ( known as Cam@@ den tablets ) dissolved in water , release small quantities of sulphur di@@ ox ­ ide of comparable concentrations to that found in polluted air .
the Petr@@ i dishes and se@@ ed@@ lings are then placed In@@ side a plastic bag , together with another Petr@@ i dish containing a sodium met@@ ab@@ is@@ ul@@ ph@@ ite tablet dissolved in a little water .
the bag is sealed , lab@@ elled and left in a sunny place .
also set up a control without the met@@ ab@@ is@@ ul@@ ph@@ l@@ te tablet for comparison .
observe the se@@ ed@@ lings over the next ten days and record their growth .
get the students to examine the effects of different concentrations , light In@@ ten@@ si ­ ty and temperature on se@@ ed@@ ling growth .
examine the effect of sulphur dioxide on various building materials by placing samples of lim@@ estone , tile , brick etc. in a bell jar and introduce sulphur dioxide gas from a sodium met@@ ab@@ is@@ ul@@ ph@@ l@@ te solution or directly from a cylinder .
observe the changes to the stone over the following three weeks .
the bell jar should not be removed from this experiment during this period .
the per ­ me@@ able stones will show clear evidence of pit@@ ting and corrosion .
get students to look for similar signs of pollution corrosion of st@@ one@@ work ( old buildings , statues etc . ) in their town or city .
environmental scientists sometimes use lic@@ hen surveys to find out the pollution level In a local area .
lic@@ h@@ ens are grow@@ ths on trees and other surfaces .
they are generally pale in colour and should not be confused with mos@@ ses which are green@@ er and more plant like .
check the local lic@@ hen species near to the school and give students drawings and descriptions of them to make them easier to identify .
main themes of this chapter
► the concepts of nuclear fis@@ sion and nuclear fusion ► the principle of how a nuclear power station works ► radiation risks , safety and the issue of waste disposal .
key information
in the second half of this century we have become Incre@@ as@@ ingly aware of the finite nature of the fossil fuel resources upon which our industrial societies depend .
renewable E@@ ner ­ gy from the sun and the wind provides a truly sustainable source but one that can only support a tiny fraction of our present energy demand .
in the 1950s controlled nuclear f@@ is ­ sion was achieved and the possibility of using small quantities of uranium to produce massive amounts of energy was realised .
the reality has been very different .
nuclear programmes were taken up by most Indu@@ str@@ i ­ alised countries and nuclear stations have been operating for over 30 years .
even after this time a satisfactory solution for the storage of , even medium and low level , radioactive waste has not been agreed .
the full social and economic costs of nuclear power are still not fully known .
there are two possibilities for extracting useful energy from nuclear reactions .
fis@@ sion - the splitting of large molecular weight nucle@@ i ( uranium ) and the associated release of heat energy .
this is a slow natural process ( in uranium ores for example ) which is accelerated in a controlled fashion in a nuclear reactor .
fusion - the combining of low molecular weight nucle@@ i to produce a heavier element ( e.g. hydrogen to hel@@ ium ) with release of heat energy .
this is the reaction that sust@@ ains the heat of the sun and takes place at a temperature of around 15 million degrees cent@@ i ­ grade !
scientists have been trying to simul@@ ate and harness this fusion reaction in very large ring @@@ -@@ @ shaped electromagnetic fields ( called a tor@@ us ) .
these machines can accelerate atoms to vast speeds In a vacuum in an attempt to create the right conditions for fusion to occur .
nuclear fusion offers the promise of nuclear power without the radiation dangers and waste disposal problems of conventional nuclear fis@@ sion reactors .
however , despite extensive international research , nuclear fusion has still not been proven to be econom@@ i ­ cally feasible .
commercial power generation from nuclear fusion will not be available for many years , if it proves to be possible at all .
nuclear power stations use the uranium fis@@ sion reaction to release heat which is re ­ covered in a heat ex@@ changer and used to raise steam to drive turbines and electrical gen ­ er@@ ators .
this steam cycle and generation elements are exactly the same as In a conventional fossil fuel generating station .
the nuclear reactions take place in the heavily shiel@@ ded and fully automated reactor core .
uranium releases neutr@@ ons which colli@@ de and set off further chain reactions .
the speed of the reaction is controlled by the insertion of moder@@ ators ( usually graph@@ ite rods ) which absorb free neutr@@ ons .
the heat generated by the reaction is extracted through a heat exchange circuit which in turn raises the tem@@ per ­ ature of water to high pressure steam and is used to drive the turbines .
figure 9 : schem@@ atic of a nuclear power station
this type of reactor accounts for only around 10 % of the world 's nuclear generating capacity .
optional topic - Nuclear power in the world
presently there are around 4@@ 30 nuclear reactors in operation around the world which together provide 17 % of total world electricity generation .
this represents less than 5 % of our total energy needs .
whilst overall dependence on nuclear power is less than a fifth of electricity generation capacity , some countries have invested heavily in nuclear power .
for example 76 % of France 's generating capacity is nuclear and in Lithuania it is even higher at 85 % .
the following countries have more than 40 % installed nuclear capacity : Belgium , Sweden , Bulgaria , Slovak Republic , Hungary , Switzerland .
these countries have a high national dep@@ en ­ dence upon nuclear power generation and substitution to another non @@@ -@@ @ nuclear source would be complex and expensive .
the output from the exercise might be presented as a television style documentary with role play Inter@@ views and debates .
if you have access to a video camera - record it .
alternatively ask students to write letters as If to the government or national newspapers .
get groups of students to take the view@@ points of different interest groups such as environmental groups , economists , workers from the nuclear power stations and others .
nuclear power stations do not release dangerous radiation when in normal operation , and there have been very few nuclear incidents that have actually caused harm to human health .
radiation C@@ AN@@ NOT be seen or felt and radiation recep@@ tive film bad@@ ges and Ge@@ ig@@ er counters are used by nuclear workers to ensure they do not exceed the advised safe radiation dos@@ age throughout their lifetime .
these accidents , and above all that of Chernobyl , have been responsible for informing world opinion of the very real danger that nuclear energy can pose .
the Chernobyl acc@@ i ­ dent raised awareness of the importance of international dialogue to control nuclear energy and the crucial need to set In place adequate security measures .
a long term disposal problem
perhaps the most significant question that remains un@@ answered is the safe disposal of radioactive waste .
low level waste , which includes tools , clothing etc. may require protected storage for a few hundred years before being considered safe .
spend fuel rods can be re@@ processed , which helps to reduce the quantity of high level waste generated .
the design of suitable storage facilities presents a massive challenge to nuclear techn@@ ologists .
the options include , vit@@ ri@@ fication ( sealing within glass ) and enc@@ as@@ ement in concrete , deep underground storage chambers and ocean burial .
the research and debate is on @@@ -@@ @ going and nuclear waste is presently held in long term , but temporary , storage facilities .
suggested activities - Nuclear power φ
role play on sitting a nuclear power station in the neighbourhood .
ask the students to imagine that a nuclear power station is to be built near to the school .
however , before the final decision is to be made there will be a public meeting at which three groups of people will have an opportunity to present their views .
divide the class into these three groups and give them the rest of the lesson to prepare their case .
students should be given information sheets explaining something about the proposed site and the economic case for the power station .
various other resources might also be made available to the students such as databases , textbooks , a library , local newspapers , magazine articles or video material .
group A ; E@@ no@@ ine@@ ers and scientists
you want the power station to be built because you think that nuclear power is a clean and efficient way to build up the prosperity in the region .
also If this station is built it will keep you in work and make it more likely that other stations are built in the future .
you are convinced that any safety problems have been overcome .
you expect the local politicians to support you because they persuaded you to bring the power station to this site .
however , you also know that they will want to test you out on issues of interest to their electorate In public .
you need to research these matters thoroughly .
group B : local people
will it employ local people or will the jobs go to highly skilled people from other parts of the country ?
perhaps it will mean improvement to local services such as roads and communications .
on the other hand it may bring pollution , risk of accidents and danger of cancers .
you want to be convinced that that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages .
the main issues are : • Safety issues • Poll@@ ution issues • Dis@@ pos@@ al of waste • Employment matters • Cost of energy produced .
you need to research these matters thoroughly .
you know that the area needs more energy in order to develop and that nuclear power is cheap and efficient .
the power station has got to go somewhere , so why not here .
you have worked hard to get this project because it should bring jobs and prosperity to the area .
however , the people elected you so you 've got to listen to their con ­ cer@@ ns .
you will have to live with this decision long after the scientists and eng@@ i ­ ne@@ ers have left to build there next power station .
so on the one hand you seek re@@ assurance from the scientists and engineers , on the other hand you seek to reassure the local people .
the main issues are : • Safety issues • Poll@@ ution issues • Dis@@ pos@@ al of waste • Employment matters • Cost of energy .
you need to research these matters thoroughly .
towards the end of the preparation phase , teachers should check that the groups are ready to proceed with the role play during the following session .
a seating plan " in the round " is ideal for this kind of activity .
similarities and differences between nuclear power stations and fossil fuel stations .
ask the students to draw comparisons and contrasts between nuclear and conventional fossil fuel generating stations .
present the findings as posters .
living with nuclear power .
lead a discussion with students about how they would feel if they had to live near a nuclear power station .
the students could then write this up as a letter to a friend discussing their feelings .
main themes of this chapter
key information
what are renewable energies ?
our present energy systems rely to a great extent upon fossil fuels ( and to a smaller extent uranium ) of which there is only a finite quantity .
ultimately these resources will run out .
renewable energy sources , sometimes known as ' alternative energy sources ' , are not of a finite nature .
they are continually replen@@ ished by the earth 's natural cycles and therefore provide an in@@ exha@@ ustible source of energy .
they may be grouped into five broad categories : • solar • wind • biomass • water • ge@@ other@@ mal .
the water category Inclu@@ des power from rivers , dams and oceans .
renewable energies seem to provide an ideal energy source : they are in@@ exha@@ ustible and environmentally friendly .
they do not release carbon dioxide or other pollutants and they create very little waste .
presently renewable contribute only around 2.5 % to man 's energy demand world @@@ -@@ @ wide .
some countries utilis@@ e a high proportion of renewable sources .
in Brazil over 95 % of electricity generation is from hydroelectric stations , and the use of wood and other biomass is still extremely Import@@ ant in rural Africa for cooking and heating .
all renewable energies have solar origins
the source of each of the renewable energies is the sun .
biomass is composed of plant material which has derived its energy from the sun through pho@@ tos@@ yn@@ thesis .
the rivers are fed by rain which Is created by the conv@@ ection cycle of water vap@@ our from oceans and lakes , again driven by the heat of the sun .
indeed the fossil fuels also have their origins in the sun 's energy , but on a massive time cycle .
as we have seen coal Is the final product of decom@@ posed plant matter which , like biomass , derived its energy from the sun .
not always environmentally friendly
they do not produce the carbon dioxide and other pollutants resulting from fossil fuel combustion , and they do not leave a legacy of radioactive waste as from nuclear power .
however they are not without their problems and larger projects have come under intense criticism in some countries .
other examples are the construction of major ' wind farms ' , areas of often scen@@ ically Import@@ ant land , with large groupings of wind turbines .
the largest wind farms in Europe contain around 100 turbines , in parts of the USA there are much more extensive sites .
another aspect to consider is the environmental cost of producing the technologies used to capture renewable energies e.g. the energy and raw materials utilis@@ ed to produce a wind turbine .
renewable energy sources have a valuable role to fulfil In a balanced energy system .
they are a dispersed and expensive energy resource that will probably never fully replace our usage of fossil fuels .
however in conjunction with activities to reduce our consum@@ p ­ tion of energy , renewable can help to diminish our dependence on fossil fuel and thereby slow the rate of carbon dioxide release and other pollution .
students should understand : • the concepts of passive solar heating and photo@@ vol@@ tal@@ cs ( p@@ v ) • commercial applications for solar energy .
the earth receives almost all of Its energy from the sun .
on reaching the earth 's At@@ mos ­ phere , radiation from the sun is part reflected , absorbed , re@@ fr@@ acted and radi@@ ated .
the atmosphere both shi@@ elds us from the full strength of the sun 's radiation and provides an insul@@ ating blanket which retains essential warmth .
one estimate suggests that the sun provides the earth with 15,000 times the total energy consumed by man each year .
solar power can be used to provide heating for buildings through appropriate design and orientation .
active solar is most commonly used to assist domestic hot water and heating systems .
figure 10 : active solar heating system
active solar systems are also used for power generation , such as a very large example in California which produces 10 MW of electricity .
a huge array of mirrors concentrates the sun 's rays and is used to heat water and raise steam to drive a turbine and generate electricity .
smaller systems ( up to 15 kW ) will use a single refl@@ ective dish perhaps up to 15 m in diameter .
solar cells make use of the particular characteristic of silicon to emit a small quantity of electricity when struck by sunlight .
this is called the photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic effect .
other materials are also pho@@ tos@@ en@@ sitive , but silicon is the material generally used .
it is in plentiful supply and makes up around 28 % of the earth 's cr@@ ust .
individual cells generate only around 1 wat@@ t of electricity , however when multiple cells are connected together In panels to form an array they can produce tens of kilow@@ at@@ ts .
Silicon technology has advanced greatly In recent years , improving the efficiency of solar panels and reducing their cost .
photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics are used extensively for remote Install@@ a ­ tions - the best example being their use in outer space for powering satellite commun@@ ica ­ tion systems .
Matt black surfaces absorb more radiation than white , shiny surfaces and protecting absor@@ bers from wind chill under glass Incre@@ ases the heating effect by tr@@ apping reflected radiation and allowing conv@@ ection .
examine the different heating effects on containers of water painted in white and black and exposed to the sun .
how does the temperature vary if similar containers are enclosed in a glass topped box ?
wind power - not a new technology
the early sailing ships relied solely on the wind for motive power , wind@@ mills have been used for centuries for pumping water and grinding corn .
the smallest turbines may only generate 500 wat@@ ts , sufficient to power a television , and the largest are several meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts , enough power for a small town .
multiple arrays , called wind @@@ -@@ @ farms typically use turbines of around 300 kW which may stand 50@@ m high and have a blade diameter of 30@@ m .
choosing the right sites
wind turbines can only be Inst@@ alled where the wind resource is adequate .
such sites are usually found in hil@@ ly and often coastal areas .
careful monitoring and wind mapping is required to assess the su@@ itability of proposed sites .
sites should also be close enough to existing electricity distribution systems and centres of demand .
wind turbines have a major visual impact , and their location on high exposed areas , has given rise to grave public concern about spo@@ iling the countryside 's traditional views .
noise is also an issue .
as the technology advances , and the need for regular servicing dimin@@ ishes , the sitting of turbines a short distance out to sea has come more viable .
this increases the cost , and the technical challenges are harder , yet the wind resources are better and the issues of visual and noise In@@ tru@@ sion resolved .
modern turbines are large structures that need to withstand severe storm and wind con ­ di@@ tions , yet remain light and responsive to operation In conditions of little wind .
the ro@@ tor is designed to operate at a fixed speed ( typically 34 rpm ) and the angle of the blades is automatically trim@@ med to achieve this speed .
the head or ' n@@ ac@@ elle ' of the turbine Is also turned by a y@@ aw motor so that it continually faces into the direction of the wind .
the turbines blades , perhaps each being 15@@ m long for a 300 kW machine , are as@@ se@@ m ­ bled by hand from a composite glass fibre material reinforced with wood or aluminium .
the construction technique has been developed from that used for the h@@ ul@@ ls of modern sailing yachts .
blades may sometimes be made from steel .
biomass
students should understand : • many different forms of biomass may be used as fuel • energy may be recovered as heat , fuel or electricity • the possibilities and limitations of recovering energy from urban solid waste .
the main types are set out in the table along with techniques used for their use .
combustion of biomass is a carbon dioxide neutral process .
plants utilis@@ e carbon dioxide during the pho@@ tos@@ yn@@ thesis growing cycle .
carbon dioxide is then released as the material Is burnt .
sustainably grown timber and energy crops are an energy resource that does not contribute to increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide .
straw , poultry litter , sugar b@@ ag@@ asse , etc .
power generation ( only a few commercial examples )
fast growing biomass grown specifically for fuel e.g. wil@@ low or mis@@ can@@ thus
solid urban waste
domestic and commercial wastes a ) Large scale incin@@ eration with energy recovery , used for power generation b ) Recovery of methane gas from land@@ fill sites , used for power generation and industrial heating applications
most bl@@ om@@ ass applications involve the direct combustion of the material as fuel , some ­ times In combination with fossil fuels .
other techniques , such as g@@ asi@@ fication and py@@ ro@@ ly@@ sis , produce a secondary fuel ( gas and liquid respectively ) that may be burnt in more conventional systems .
neither of these technologies are fully developed and commercial ­ ly proven .
methane @@@ -@@ @ rich bi@@ og@@ as is evolved from an@@ aerob@@ ic breakdown of waste material In sealed land@@ fill sites and sewage dig@@ est@@ ers ( Figure 12 ) .
this is proving to be a highly economic technology in many countries ( China , India , etc . ) .
figure 12 : animal d@@ ung fermentation is a source of energy ( gas ) suitable for farms
urban waste as fuel
urban wastes present a disposal problem .
the two major disposal routes are burial in a land@@ fill site , or incin@@ eration in large mass burn installations .
both techniques have ass@@ oc@@ i ­ ated costs and environmental impacts .
land@@ fills should be carefully prepared and man ­ aged to prevent le@@ aching of poll@@ uting materials In@@ to underground water courses , and to prevent dangerous build @@@ -@@ @ up and release of methane rich gas .
inc@@ iner@@ ators are expensive to operate and release the pollution from the waste either as chim@@ ney emissions or with ­ in the ash which requires burial .
recently energy recovery has become more prevalent In both of these disposal routes as it reduces the overall cost of the disposal option per ton@@ ne of waste .
collection of land@@ fill gas is simple If the site is appropriately designed and constructed , and the gas is burnt In large reciproc@@ ating engines which in turn drive generators .
heat is recovered from In ­ cin@@ er@@ ators and used to raise steam for power generation in a steam turbine set .
water power
students should understand : • the different ways in which energy can be harn@@ essed from rivers and oceans • the advantages and drawbacks of hydroelectric power .
large @@@ -@@ @ scale hydroelectric systems are well established technologies for generation of electricity from water power ( Figure 13 ) .
in some countries , for example Brazil and Norway a very high proportion of electricity generation Is hydro@@ pow@@ c@@ r .
theses systems may use fast flowing mountain rivers , or be based on massive dam@@ ming and flooding programmes .

the main technologies are shown in the table .

social and environmental impact
hydropower has many advantages , and at least for the large scale schemes , a few major disadvantages too .
where rainfall Is seasonal , low water resources during the dry sea ­ sons can have severe impact on electrical capacity .
this can present a significant problem where hydropower comprises a high proportion of a country@@ is generating mix .
more local Issues relate to the ability of fish to make their way upstream to breeding areas and vis@@ u ­ al Impact in areas of outstanding natural beauty .
wave technologies have to contend with very aggressive environments and the cost of such technologies Is likely to be high .
the potential resource is virtually unlimited , and the research continues .
students should understand : • what ge@@ other@@ mal energy Is and how it may be harn@@ essed .
ge@@ ys@@ ers and volcanoes
ge@@ other@@ mal power makes use of the high temperatures found deep within the earth 's cr@@ ust to provide heat energy .
in a few places around the world , notably at the edge of tec@@ tonic plates , heat escap@@ es naturally at the surface In the form of hot springs , ge@@ ys@@ ers and most spectac@@ ularly volcanoes .
in other areas aqui@@ fers run through hot rocks beneath the ground and this heat can be recovered through heat exchanging systems .
cold water Is pumped down through one bore hole and Is heated by the rock before passing back to the surface .
organise a visit to a local renewable energy site , perhaps a traditional wind@@ mill or water ­ mill .
show the mill in operation grinding corn or in some other activity to demonstrate the power generated .
alternatively someone from the mill could be invited to visit the school and talk to the students about their work .
they can then place the lem@@ on@@ ade bottle upside down over the post and It should spin using the thumb t@@ ack as a bearing .
they should then remove the lem@@ on@@ ade bottle from the ret@@ ort stand and decide how many s@@ ails their wind@@ mill will have and how large the s@@ ails will be .
the lem@@ on@@ ade bottle should then be cut and fl@@ aps bent outw@@ ards to make the required number of s@@ ails .
the surface area of the s@@ ails can be worked out by tracing their shape onto squ@@ ared paper and counting the squares .
the bottle Is then replaced over the stand on the bearing .
students should count the n@@ um ­ ber of revolutions of their vertical axis wind@@ mill each minute and record this figure as the result from the experiment .
they should try this three or four times and calculate an average figure for the speed of their wind@@ mill .
the students can then experiment by making wind@@ mills with different numbers of s@@ ails or the same number of s@@ ails of different surface areas .
pieces of lem@@ on@@ ade bottle can be gl@@ ued onto the wind@@ mills if extra sail area is required .
each wind@@ mill should be tested using the same fan set at the same air flow and held the same distance away .
each time the students should take an average of three or four readings .
students should be encouraged to compare their findings with those of others so that they have more data to consider when drawing their conclusions about the lem@@ on@@ ade bottle wind@@ mills .
at the end of the investigation students should be able to write a report about the most efficient design of lem@@ on@@ ade bottle wind@@ mill .
they should have collected sufficient data to draw some more general conclusions about vertical axis wind@@ mills .
demonstrate the release of methane on decom@@ position of animal man@@ ure or comp@@ ost by setting up a simple experiment ( Figure 15 ) .
collect the off gases over water using a plastic pipe and a test tube .
note that methane will not be released until all of the air in the fl@@ ask has been used up - It may be around one week before methane can be collected .

construction of a solar heating system .
students can build a simple solar panel using an old car radi@@ ator and a water circuit of domestic heating pipes .
these pipes pass through a tank of water which the solar panel will heat up .
a simple pump is connected to the system In order to circul@@ ate the water In the pipes and the radi@@ ator .
the radi@@ ator should be painted black and mounted under a sheet of glass .
alternatively a flat col@@ l of black garden hose exposed to the sun can demonstrate the same principle .
run water slowly through the hose and measure the water temperature before and after passing through the hose ( see Figure 16 ) .
analogy between leaves and solar cells .
ask the students to draw comp@@ ar ­ isons between photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic solar cells and plant leaves as collectors of solar energy .

give students cardboard and aluminium foil to make sim ­ PL@@ E par@@ abolic refl@@ ectors .
show how effectively the device concentrates the sun 's rays by heating a small container of water ( best if painted mat@@ t black ) and mea ­ sur@@ ing the temperature rise .
these devices are also used for cooking food and heating water in remote locations , e.g. field trips .
main themes of this chapter

key information
what is electricity ?
electricity ¡ s a very convenient and controllable form of energy .
it Is easy to transport over long distances and enables us to supply energy directly In@@ to the home or factory for in@@ n@@ u ­ mer@@ able applications .
it provides heating , lighting and mechanical power at the fl@@ ick of a switch .
it Is also simple and accurate to measure Its usage which is helpful in monitoring processes and charging for consumption .
at the point of use energy does not create pol ­ l@@ ution .
it Is difficult to store , but chemical energy In batteries and potential energy , say in pumped storage reservoirs , are quickly converted back into electricity .
power transmission Is one aspect of electricity but there are many others .
electrical power is measured in wat@@ ts , kilow@@ at@@ ts , meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts etc .
see panel for examples .
this might be the total quantity of energy released by burning a lump of coal .
the rate at which energy is used or released is measured in wat@@ ts ( W ) and would be the amount of heat energy In j@@ ou@@ les that was given off per second by burning the coal .
the wat@@ t is a small unit of energy compared to , say , the output of a power station so larger units are required .
when recording an amount of electricity consumed the term kilow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hours Is used ( kWh ) this equals 3,@@ 6@@ 00,000 J.
W a small clock might use 1@@ W a household light bulb is typically 100@@ W
3 kilow@@ at@@ ts kW
10 wat@@ ts an electric bar fire uses around 1 kW domestic family uses an average of 3 kW a typical wind turbine is 300 kW
10 wat@@ ts a school heating boiler might be 23 MW a small power station would be 500 MW gi@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts
10@@ '@@ wat@@ ts a large coal power station might be 1 G@@ W It@@ ai@@ p@@ u falls hydroelectric station in Brazil ( the world 's largest ) is 12 G@@ W all of Russia 's power stations together have a capacity of 200 G@@ W
10 wat@@ ts total world energy demand is 12 T@@ W the energy radi@@ ated from the sun is 400 million million T@@ W ( 4x@@ 10@@ 26 wat@@ ts )
the ther@@ mo @@@ -@@ @ electric power station Is simply a mechanism for converting one form of energy ( fossil fuels or bl@@ om@@ ass ) In@@ to another form - electricity .
the fuel Is burned in a large combustion chamber and he@@ ats water passing through pipes In the chamber walls .
the fuel is injected together with combustion air through special burner no@@ zz@@ les .
oil is atom ­ ised as it enters the chamber and coal is crushed prior to combustion so that it may be blown In as a quickly ign@@ iting powder .
the water Is temperature is raised to form high pressure steam which is then expanded through the blades of a steam turbine , causing it to rotate at great speed .
the turbine is directly linked to a generator which produces the electric current .
in a natural gas fired power station gas is burnt directly within a gas turbine to drive the generator .
these turbines work In the same manner as aircraft turbines but are much larger and designed for continuous use .
heat Is recovered from the turbine exhaust and in high efficiency ( combined cycle ) installations Is used to raise steam and drive a sec ­ ond@@ ary steam turbine and generator .
the generation process converts the chemical energy of the fuel into thermal energy ( steam ) which Is then conden@@ sed through the turbine giving mechanical energy , and final ­ ly the generator converts this turning into electricity .
some energy Is lost in each of these conversion processes ( as heat or light or noise ) and together these losses account for the efficiency of the system .
power stations are usually located as close as possible to primary resources .
in a relative ­ ly large country the distance between the power station and consumers can be hundreds or thousands of kilometres .
the electricity distribution grid , a network or cables p@@ yl@@ ons and trans@@ formers enables the electricity to be transported around a region ( Figure 17 ) .
figure 17 : the generation , transmission and distribution of electricity
electricity is more efficiently transported at high vol@@ tages and typically different parts of the network would operate at 400 k@@ V , 330 k@@ V and 110 k@@ V .
the supply network uses lower vol@@ tages to feed In@@ to cities and towns , 35 k@@ V and 10 k@@ V are common .
the electric ­ ity Is further transformed down for end @@@ -@@ @ users - 380 vol@@ ts for Industry and 220 vol@@ ts for domestic consumers .
each of the many stages In generating and distributing electricity has associated losses .
much of this loss is inevitable ( limited by fundamental ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ic principles for trans ­ fer@@ ring energy from one form to another ) , but other losses are associated with the type of technology used , Its condition and the way it is operated .
further non @@@ -@@ @ technical losses come from the un@@ accounted loss of electricity from Il@@ legal connections .
many convention ­ al coal fired power stations are only around 30 % efficient and losses on distribution are often 10 @@@ -@@ @ 15 % .
modern natural gas stations ( called combined cycle ) and advanced coal stations ( not yet fully commercial ) are more efficient and over 50 % Is typical .
a specific problem for the energy industry is the non @@@ -@@ @ payment of energy bills by con ­ sum@@ ers - Industrial and resid@@ enti@@ al@@ 1 .
suggested activities - Electr@@ icity
assessing different energy sources .
ask groups of students to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different energy sources for generating E@@ LE@@ C ­ Tr@@ icity ( e.g. coal , gas , nuclear power , the various renewable energies ) .
prepare sets of discussion cards for each group .
these are playing card size cards , each with one of the following statements written onto It .
student groups would be given the same set of cards but asked to assess different energy sources .
statements on the discussion cards .
the first task for the students would be to sort the statements In@@ to advantages and disadvantages for their particular energy source .
students would then pr@@ i ­ or@@ iti@@ se each group of cards from the most advantageous to the least and from the most dis@@ advantageous to the least .
the only rule for this ranking exercise is that all members of the group should agree on the order of priority chosen .
once this has been completed the students can write a leaf@@ let for their class ­ mates about the advantages and disadvantages of their particular source of energy .
students should be provided with as many resources as possible for this part of the activity .
these might include textbooks , newspapers , a library , the Internet and others .
making resistance he@@ aters .
electrical Im@@ mer@@ sion he@@ aters , ket@@ tles and bar fires provide heat from resistance heating .
students can make small electric he@@ aters by co@@ iling wire around a pencil .
such he@@ aters when connected up to a labor@@ ato ­ ry power pack ( 12 vol@@ ts ) will supply enough heat to warm up a be@@ aker of water .
measure the change in temperature of the water over a fixed time period and monitor the electricity consumed with an am@@ meter ( current ) and vol@@ t@@ meter ( voltage ) .
from the readings it is possible to calculate the energy delivered by the heater two ways .
one way uses the current and voltage :
energy released ( J@@ ou@@ les ) = voltage χ current χ time in seconds
energy released ( J@@ ou@@ les ) = mass of water χ tem@@ p rise in ° C χ 4.2
from these calculations students can work out the efficiency of the heater in converting electrical energy In@@ to heat energy .
where has the other energy been lost ?
try using a variety of lengths and types of wire e.g. different gau@@ ges and various metals such as iron , copper or steel .
reducing our energy use
main themes of this chapter
► the national and global importance of reducing our energy consumption ► the concept of energy efficiency as a resource ► opportunities to reduce the amount of energy used in society , both at a national level , and locally In schools and in the home .
key information
adequate and reliable energy supplies are of vital Import@@ ance to any country 's social and economic security .
in the NIS a lack of investment and revenue has led to an electricity system that is In need of rehabilitation and new Investment to satisfy present demands .
much of the energy used is generated from highly poll@@ uting power stations , which are contributing to global climatic changes and to the detriment of peoples health .
one way of making a major contribution is to look at the way we use energy ( Figure 18 ) .
can we use less , In our homes , cities and industry ?
the answer is certainly ' yes ' and the cost is significantly less than the Investment needed in the supply system to generate additional electricity
energy efficiency can be seen as a resource .
by reducing the amount of energy used , the investment needed in new power stations is reduced , or the oldest and most pollu@@ t ­ ing power stations can be closed down .
the dependence on fuel imports is reduced , and for countries that export primary energy more can be sold - in both cases the nation ­ al economic balance of payments is improved .
reducing our energy use
other savings require investment , and although the result may be a benefit over the lifetime of the Investment the Initi@@ al cost can present an imp@@ or ­ tant hur@@ dle .
many actions and groups within society are helping to adopt the energy efficiency mes ­ s@@ age .
government actions
governments can undertake a range of information and economic actions to encourage the up@@ take of energy efficiency .
information actions
establish organisations that can provide advice and assistance . support new research activities , Inclu@@ ding international collaboration .
some are related to the building itself , to the types of fuel used and the appliances and other E@@ ner ­ gy using devices in the home .
others are behavi@@ our@@ al and relate to the way that people live and their awareness of energy w@@ ast@@ age .
simple energy saving measures keep homes warmer without using more energy , and when energy is restricted makes better use of the energy available ( Figure 19 ) .
reducing our energy use
figure 19 : energy w@@ ast@@ age at home
buildings should be well In@@ sul@@ ated to retain heat and to reduce the amount of heating required to maintain a comfortable temperature .
check for insulation In the lo@@ ft and floor ca@@ vities and that the hot water pipes and storage tank ( if present ) are l@@ agged .
Windows are a major source of heat loss .
prevent drau@@ ghts around doors and window frames by use of well fitting doors and drau@@ ght exclu@@ der strips .
thick curtains will help to reduce heat loss through windows .
other measures to increase the house 's insulation are fitting of double gla@@ zed windows and lining internal walls with In@@ sul@@ ation .
houses built with a twin external wall can have the cavity filled with insul@@ ating material .
heating systems
homes may be heated from a community heating network or with individual hot water , or electric systems in each dwelling .
individual heating gives greater control@@ l@@ ability and choice for users .
students could consider the advantages and disadvantages of the two types of heating system .
where Individual heating systems are installed their efficiency , and safety , is maxim@@ ised by regular servicing and cleaning .
radi@@ ators and hot air v@@ ents should not be covered , for example by drying clothes .
thermo@@ stats maintain rooms at the required temperature and should be turned down If a room is too warm , rather than simply opening the window !
baths use more hot water that showers , and water @@@ -@@ @ saving shower heads will reduce energy usage further .
modern electrical appliances are considerably more efficient than models designed ten years or so ago .
energy lab@@ elling schemes are becoming more widespread .
reducing our energy use
we can also make best use of electrical appliances .
refriger@@ ators and refriger@@ ator@@ freez@@ ers are more efficient If de@@ fro@@ sted regularly .
simple actions such as only boil ­ ing the quantity of water needed also help to reduce energy use .
compact fluo@@ rescent lamps ( CF@@ Ls ) are available that use four times less power than con ­ v@@ entional inc@@ and@@ escent light bulbs and last around eight times longer .
consider replacing lights that are left on for more than a couple of hours each day with more efficient lamps .
switch off lights when leaving a room , and use lower power lights closer to working areas e.g. desk lights .
keep light bulbs , refl@@ ectors and shades clean to maxim@@ ise light output .
recycling also helps to reduce energy consumption .
processing of plastic , metal and glass containers Is energy intensive .
higher levels of reuse and recycling therefore saves primary energy .
collective transport systems are greatly more efficient than use of the personal motor car ( Figure 20 ) .
rail travel typically uses less than 10 % of the energy consumed In road transport .
many countries have established schemes which provide incentives for people to reduce their car use and switch to collective transport .
this has maximum effect in cong@@ ested urban situations where collective transport has access to priority lanes and journey times are faster .
this has several components , speeds closer to the optimum engine efficiency and reducing the effect of air and road friction .
simple aero@@ dynamic sty@@ ling for lor@@ ries can reduce fuel consumption by over 15 % .
reducing our energy use
suggested activities - Reduc@@ ing our energy use
groups of students could Investig@@ ate different parts of the school .
energy use Is assessed as either lighting or heating .
find out whether there are Government standards for lighting levels In schools .
students could Inter@@ view the school care@@ t@@ aker to find out how often lights are left on unnecessarily .
the care@@ t@@ aker would also be able to explain to the students about the kinds of lights used In different rooms .
students can find out about the energy efficiency of the types of lights used .
students can calculate the heat supplied by a boiler and try to estimate how much of that energy was wasted before it reached the classrooms .
levels of insulation on pi@@ pe@@ work could be investigated and temperature differences in di@@ f ­ fer@@ ent parts of the pi@@ pe@@ work and school measured .
look for other heating appl@@ i ­ ances , e.g. electric fires , asses the condition of the windows and doors - are there drau@@ ghts ? is double gla@@ zing fitted ?
students could interview the school care@@ t@@ aker about the efficiency of the boiler and losses through windows and doors being left open .
students could examine school plans and builders ' draw ­ ings to find out about standards of insulation in the walls and roof of the building .
the energy audit would be written up as a report for the school principle .
this should include data to support the findings and recommendations .
the School Princip@@ al could be invited to a future lesson to discuss the survey findings and the survey 's recommendations .
alternatively the students could make a pres@@ en ­ tation of their findings to him / her .
students could bring in curtain material , carpet , under@@ lay , lin@@ oleum , poly@@ sty@@ rene and w@@ ool@@ len clothes .
these materials are used In the home to pre ­ vent heat loss and to thus save energy .
the students would need 250 ml be@@ akers , he@@ at@@ proof mats , ther@@ mom@@ eters and an electric kettle to carry out the following experiment .
groups of students could test the different materials using the following pro@@ ce ­ d@@ ure .
first heat some water In the kettle and stand the be@@ aker on the heat proof mat .
carefully pour exactly 100 m@@ is of hot water In@@ to the be@@ aker .
then wrap the be@@ aker carefully in the material taking care to make sure that the ther@@ mom@@ eter bulb is in the water but that the scale can be read .
take the temperature of the water at half minute Inter@@ vals and record the results .
when each group has finished their experiment they can draw a graph of their results .
these graphs can be pinned up on the school notice board so that groups can compare and discuss their findings with the others .
students can write a report detail@@ ing the whole of the Investig@@ ation .
reducing our energy use
students could carry out an energy efficiency survey on their homes .
they could check to see whether their home has wall and roof insulation , or double gla@@ zing . they could find out whether the heating system Is controlled by a thermo@@ stat .
the students could do spot checks on whether the lights are left on unnecessarily . they could investigate the appliances that are used at home and find out how energy efficient they are .
students could also look at ways of motiv@@ ating their families to save energy in the home .
the energy company perspective .
ask the students to consider themselves as managers within the electrical or heat utility supplying their neighbourhood .
ask if a representative of the local utility would be willing to visit the school to answer the students questions or to take part in a discussion .
local transport systems .
get the students to analyse the transport systems used In their neighbourhood .
carry out a traffic survey to estimate the mix of di@@ f ­ fer@@ ent forms of road traffic .
Su@@ i@@ vey within the school , or to parents to find out what forms of transport are used : walking , cycling , buses , cars etc .
transport systems In other countries can be very different , with limited public transport and higher personal car ownership .
contrast a city in NIS with one in the USA .
examine and forecast trends in local transport use .
travel choices .
ask them to assess journey plans for specific routes , perhaps between home and school , or between two local towns , or from their home to say , Paris In France .
how long would it take and how much does it cost ?
energy in NIS countries
main themes of this chapter
► summary information on energy use in the NIS ► comparison with energy use in other parts of the world ► summary of the energy supply situation in NIS : the example of Russia .
key information
the countries of the former Soviet Union have In@@ her@@ ited an Industrial base that is among the most energy intensive in the world .
other Industries are perhaps one third more energy consuming than their Western counterparts .
energy intensity has Incre@@ ased in the region by around 30 % since 1990 .
this has ac@@ com ­ pan@@ ied a dramatic fall In economic and industrial activity , and reflects industrial enter@@ pr@@ is ­ es operating at a fraction of normal output .
in 1990 , the distribution of energy use in the NIS region was as shown below .
for com ­ par@@ ison the energy use in a typical Western European country ( UK ) is also shown .
► Energy consumption NIS , 1990 : industry 48 % , buildings 24 % , transport 15 % , agr@@ ic@@ ul ­ ture and other 13 % .
► Energy consumption UK , 1990 : industry 25 % , transport 32 % , buildings 29 % , services 13 % , agriculture 1 % .
transport Is generally more efficient In NIS compared to Western countries due to the lower proportion of private car ownership and greater use of public transport .
many countries In the West have insti@@ gated programmes and In@@ c@@ enti@@ ves to encourage a switch from private car usage to greater use of public transport .
the most interesting options include : • solar heating for domestic and Industrial applications • bi@@ og@@ as generation from land@@ fill sites and sewage sl@@ udge • small hydropower • ge@@ other@@ mal systems .
energy consumption in homes and other buildings Is found to be significantly higher throughout NIS than In Europe and North America .
some of the reasons are a lack of good insulation In buildings , poor efficiency of ageing municipal heating networks and the inability ( or incentive ) for individual families to control their heating use .
electrical appliances are rarely designed for high efficiency in the NIS .
in Europe many appliances are now marked with an energy label that gives clear advice to the purch@@ aser on the appliance 's energy consumption .
energy statistics can provide many opportunities for students to practice data han ­ dling activities .
examples of the type of Information that can be us@@ efully collected are given in the previous sections of this hand@@ book and in the box below . energy statistics can be compiled from many other sources .
ask students to produce graphs , hist@@ ograms and pie charts from the data .
use the data with the students to practice Information Technology skills .
input data into computer databases or spread@@ sheets and produce a variety of graph@@ i ­ cal output presentations .
get students to gather additional information from television and radio , newsp@@ a ­ pers , the library and the Internet to explore comparisons and trends in energy use and related issues .
ask students to investigate and compare energy statistics in NIS countries .
an example of the type of data that can be collected ( for Russia ) is given below .
example : energy supply in Russia
Russia is extremely important In its contribution to global energy markets .
its natural gas reserves are the largest in the world , Its coal reserves the second largest and oil the eighth .
one third of the gas produced In Russia Is exported , to markets within the NIS region and Europe .
Russia supplies about a quarter of Western Europe 's gas needs .
energy exports accounted for 45 % of all foreign income in 1996 , which demonstrates clearly the importance of energy resources to the economy .
besides exporting fuels Russia has a massive domestic demand for energy , ranking second highest in the world .
only the USA has a larger energy consumption .
the gas ­ fields are concentrated in the Siberian Tyumen region , and production Is mainly from twenty giant fields In this area .
the gas is distributed by an extensive pipeline network throughout NIS which links In@@ to the European systems .
coal reserves in Russia represent around 25 % of known world resources .
it Is found in various regions notably in Don@@ bass ( bordering Ukraine ) , Pec@@ hor@@ a ( Arctic ) and Kuz@@ bass and K@@ ansk ­ Ach@@ insk ( Siberia ) .
the majority of this coal Is mined for Russian consumption , as it is a widely used fuel for power generation , industry and urban heating systems .
energy in NIS countries
a dramatic four@@ fold Incre@@ ase in car owner ­ ship since 1992 has put Incre@@ asing strain on the Russia 's two refineries that produce high quality petroleum .
electricity generation
Russia 's electricity is predominantly generated from fossil fuels in over 600 thermal plants .
together these supply 70 % of all electricity generation .
the remainder Is sourced from hydroelectric stations ( 20 % ) and there are 29 nuclear power plants which account for a little over 10 % .
demand for electricity Is growing and new power stations are being constructed .
because of Russia 's size , many out@@ lying areas are not connected to the electricity grid , and rely on small diesel power stations .
parts of Russia 's energy system experience severe financial difficulties with high E@@ ner ­ gy losses , many non @@@ -@@ @ accountable energy users and unpaid consumer debts .
the result Is an energy system that has suffered the neglect of basic maintenance for many years and is in urgent need of investment .
in the coal Industry these factors have led to major labour strikes as miners ' salaries are not paid .
many mines have been forced to close .
glos@@ sary
rain , de@@ w or snow which Is more aci@@ dic than usual , produced by sulphur dioxide and nitrogen ox@@ ides given off by the Com@@ bus ­ tion of fossil fuels .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the impact of these projects is not limited to the narrow geographical area in which they were implemented .
results will also benefit organisations and individuals in other regions .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
this brochure explains the meaning of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative today , presenting various aspects involving the creation and profitable functioning of a modern co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
targets Private farmers , members of former state enterprises , agricultural training institutes .
the collapse of the former centr@@ alised command system and the disintegration of the state @@@ -@@ @ owned distribution scheme resulted in a completely dis@@ organised agricultural sec ­ tor very often to the detriment of the producers ' interests .
many private ag@@ ri@@ business firms have developed and offer inputs and machinery to the producers , generally payable at harvest .
however , having benefited from their former links to obtain the necessary lic@@ ences , they now enjoy a dominant position whereby they control most of the logistical aspects .
thus , the market lacks transparency and competition .
these co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have progressively grown and nowadays , most of them each have several hundred members .
in France , for example , 1,@@ 300 co @@@ -@@ @ operatives employ more than 8@@ 5,000 people .
some co @@@ -@@ @ operatives are leading enterprises in their particular market ( milk , fla@@ x , etc . ) .
thus , they decided to test the co @@@ -@@ @ operative model of organisation as a means of solving them .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative succeeded in providing inputs and machinery at very favourable conditions , up to 10 to 40 % off the " normal " local price .
► In Novosibirsk ( Russia ) 15 co @@@ -@@ @ operatives were registered between April 1996 and April 1997 .
main themes of this chapter
the way that a co @@@ -@@ @ operative deals with its members , determines its prices and the way that it is financed results from that .
figure 2 : a co @@@ -@@ @ operative does not make profit for itself
the owners bring in capital : they invest share capital in order to ensure profit
the members bring in activity : they join the co @@@ -@@ @ operative to obtain services and bring in shares in accordance with their activity with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative
the aim is to ensure profit
the aim is to ensure the best service at the best price
the result is distributed in the form of reb@@ ates and price compl@@ ements to farmers
agricultural producers are clients or suppliers : relations have a commercial character
but relations between the co @@@ -@@ @ operative and external partners are purely commercial
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative can deal with everything that is linked to farming , except farm production It@@ self .
no confusion should be made between these two entirely different concepts .
the members work on their own farms , not in the co @@@ -@@ @ operative
the members pool together all their means of production : workforce , shares of land , shares of equity
the members pool together the results of their activity : for example , their produce to be marketed or processed , and / or their means of production .
the members earn their money from their own farming activities .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have proved their efficiency in Europe
collective farms have proved to have a low efficiency .
in market economy countries , this model of organisation does not exist - except for small farming groups , which bring together two or three farmers , generally from the same family
main themes of this chapter
activity commitments form the very basis of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
it has to collect a great number of orders , so as to build up bargaining power .
should it invest in the facilities or equipment required for pro ­ c@@ essing or machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling , It would firstly need to be sure of a sufficient volume of activity .
therefore the activity commit ­ ments should be undertaken for a period of several years .
this question should be examined carefully as the decision might have negative consequences on the development of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
should non@@ members be allowed to receive the same services as members ?
if so , no one would be prepared to accept anymore the constraints set down by membership
• If they become too important , activities with non@@ members bear the risk of ed@@ ging members out and consequently causing producers to lose control of the co @@@ -@@ @ opera ­ tive 's management .
this is what happened with Ag@@ ro@@ Dni@@ ep@@ r in Ukraine .
nevertheless , allowing a small proportion of non@@ members to participate may be a way of attracting new members .
► The experience in Ukraine and Moldova
agro @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r suffered a reduction in its membership , and tried to develop activities with non @@@ -@@ @ members .
on the one hand , they proposed to non@@ members the offer of making purchases through Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r .
in this case the non @@@ -@@ @ member farms were able to benefit from wholesale prices , but they refused to take delivery of the goods they had ordered , and Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r was never paid .
on the other hand , the manager signed contracts for the sale of commodities that the producers could not deliver .
moreover , he signed important sale contracts for commodities that he did not hold , at the risk of penalties .
this situation led to the failure of Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r .
it could not cover the debts resulting from its manager 's hazardous operations and late deliveries by the producers and , as a result , was unable to recover .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's man ­ ager was dismissed .
the situation is rather different in the J@@ ub@@ ert , co @@@ -@@ @ operative and other co @@@ -@@ @ operatives created within the framework of the collective farm re@@ organisation In process in the Or@@ he@@ i district .
it is therefore understandable that the co @@@ -@@ @ operatives also provide services to non @@@ -@@ @ members , who were previously used to using the same facilities and equipment .
working capital is required by co @@@ -@@ @ operatives to meet operating expenditures such as wages , consum@@ able , offices and premises .
the share capital must be sufficient to enable the co @@@ -@@ @ operative to face these expenditures till payments come in from customers .
another way to finance this working capital is to ask the members for monthly or quarter ­ ly subscriptions .
should a co @@@ -@@ @ operative make advanced payments for the products delivered by the me@@ m ­ bers - but this Is unlikely at least at the beginning - It would also require a corresponding level of working capital .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives also need funds to finance fixed assets ( see Table 3 ) .
while credit can be requested a part still has to be self @@@ -@@ @ financed .
in the initial stages , large investments - such as in processing or storage facilities - have to be considered very cauti@@ ously .

shares materi@@ alise members ' joint commitment with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
different criteria may be used to ap@@ praise the volume of the activity : yearly turnover with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative , volume of subscri@@ bed services , ac@@ re@@ age of the farm , etc .
in fact , ac@@ re@@ age , which is directly linked to activity , is a convenient basis for calculating a first payment .
later on , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative may retain extra shares In proportion to the activity each member has had with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
as a rule , a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is not intended to make profits .
in order to achieve such a predetermined result , the agricultural produce purchasing prices and the In@@ puts and services selling prices must be globally equal to the cost prices , recorded by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
the final purchasing price for agricultural produce equals the provisional price plus the complement of price .
the final selling prices of the inputs and services amounts to the provisional price minus the reb@@ ates .

attention has to be paid to the particul@@ arities of the taxation system , in order to avoid undue taxes .
VAT , for example , is based on the difference between the purchasing and selling price ; it is the final selling price of inputs - and not the provisional one - that has to be taken In@@ to consideration .
when determining the provisional prices , co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have to take into account both the expected cost prices for produce and services ( Table 5 ) and the existing market environment .
the management has to be very cautious : the inputs and services selling prices should be slightly over@@ estimated , and the agricultural produce purchasing prices under@@ estim@@ at ­ h
nevertheless , this safety margin should not be excessive .
all of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's expenditure and receipts have to be carefully forecast .
if the co ­ operative has several activities , these expenditures have to be distributed among the var ­ IO@@ Us activities .
direct costs and specific costs ( i.e. the fixed costs that are directly linked to an activity ) are charged to the related activity . the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's over@@ heads have to
be distributed among the various activities ; there are no rules about how to do this , and any approach can be chosen , according to the specific situation of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative ' .

over@@ heads : arbitrary distribution
( * ) the different services offered by co @@@ -@@ @ operatives are described in the following chapter .
however , determination of provisional prices should not result only from a price / cost cal ­ cul@@ ation , but should also take In@@ to consideration the market environment and the co ­ operative pricing policy .
the use of the financial surplus is a strategic decision which requires that consideration be given to four key ele ­ ments .
determination of reb@@ ates and price compl@@ ements is a strategic decision which has important consequences on the future development of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
this will depend on the benefits the members have already realised from the provisional prices .
as a matter of fact , they expect to be better off when dealing through the co ­ operative , and some significant signs that this is true should be given .
this solution - which has the same result - has several advantages : - it avoids profit taxation - it allows a share distribution in proportion with members ' activity .
B ) Distribution of the surplus among the various branches of activity
if the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is involved in both input supply and marketing activities , the shares to be allocated respectively to price compl@@ ements and to reb@@ ates have to be determined .
a good way to urge producers to increase their deliveries to the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is to give the priority to price compl@@ ements over reb@@ ates .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can use reb@@ ates and prices as a marketing tool .

what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
main themes of this chapter
inputs and machinery supply
selection of supplies and suppliers
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative aims to provide the best solutions for ensuring that the members receive the necessary supplies .
it does not aim at finding outlets for the equipment or inputs offered by its suppliers .
collecting suppliers ' proposals Is obviously necessary , but they have to be analysed with a view to producers ' needs .
the approach of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative therefore differs from the activity of a market information centre , which merely dissemin@@ ates the information collected from suppliers .
the co ­ operative makes a selection with regard to members ' needs and interests .
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative can play a major role in selecting the supplies and suppliers best suited to the members ' needs .
selling prices should include all costs ( transportation , credit and guarantee ) .
figure 5 : members work on their own farms and use services provided by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative
each member retains the freedom to decide upon the supply policy for his own farm , but conduct that is detrimental to the general interest should be prohibited .
• The co @@@ -@@ @ operative should not forbid a member to seize an exceptional opportunity .
however , a minimal commitment is necessary .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have no resources of their own for granting credit .
the mobil@@ isation of external financial resources Is therefore the key for success .
the producers obviously have limited sel@@ ff@@ in@@ ancing capacities .
however , some sel@@ ff@@ in@@ ancing has to be required .
difficulties in paying the remainder at H@@ ar ­ v@@ est time still occurred , but it would have been disastrous if the producers had not had to make a pre@@ payment .
sel@@ ff@@ in@@ ancing acts as a self @@@ -@@ @ regulation mechanism .
every creditor requires a certain level of self @@@ -@@ @ financing ; therefore a co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to pass this requirement on to its members .
moreover , each purchase of equipment or inputs involves additional costs such as for transport , customs clearance , VAT pay ­ ments , bank guarantees and Insurance .
the credits that a co @@@ -@@ @ operative can apply for do cover these costs .
this means that a co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to ask its members for higher pre ­ payments , in order to cope with these expenses .
the supplier demands a 20 % pre@@ payment and grants credit for 80 % of the sum .
transport , customs clearance and guarantees for this pur ­ chase amount to 20 .
therefore , the following conditions apply to the price offered to members : the selling price amounts to 120 , with a 30 % ( I.@@ e.
the bank is the normal supplier of credit .
the banking system is presently improving in the NIS and is able to offer more suitable financing arrangements than in the past .
however , the banks have little confidence in agricultural producers In general , and will hardly trust a newly created co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
therefore , the conditions that they propose - interest rates , terms of reimbursement - are highly un@@ favourable and the guarantees required can be exor@@ bit@@ ant .
the preparation of an application is time @@@ -@@ @ consuming : only after one or two years of operation , once a co @@@ -@@ @ operative has acquired some strength , could such an application be considered .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives must try to work with the banks , but at the same time they should look for other sources of financing .
► Suppl@@ iers and foreign firms
local ag@@ ri@@ business firms offer supplies to producers in exchange for agricultural com ­ modi@@ ties at harvest time , but generally under un@@ favourable conditions .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives , representing an important volume of activity , may try to negotiate special conditions with these firms , but the opportunity to do this Is rather limited .
several foreign firms are offering inputs and machinery for payments in kind after the H@@ ar ­ v@@ est .
generally , the prices they offer are of course higher than the ex @@@ -@@ @ works ' prices , but considerably lower than the prices proposed by the local ag@@ ri@@ business firms .
they demand a guarantee from a first rate local bank .
the range of supplies they offer vary , as do the conditions of delivery and the proposed prices for agr@@ i ­ cultural commodities - thus this can be an important selection criterion .
processing enterprises could be good partners for co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
processing enterprises face considerable difficulties with raw material supplies , and as a result they understand that for them , supporting agricultural production is a priority investment .
they are already used to providing producers with supplies - mainly fuel - in exchange for the forthcoming harvest .
in the current situation , they are obliged however to manage a greater number of SE@@ PA ­ rate contracts with many more producers .
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative , whose members are collectively responsible , provides better guarantees for repayment .
therefore , it is in the interest of processing enterprises to set up partnership relations with co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
it is also In the producers ' interest to have such relations .
nevertheless , since processing plants lack ready money , this support will in most cases be in the form of a loan in kind .
therefore , co @@@ -@@ @ operatives should be able to efficiently transform these commodities into means of payment .
when granting credit for supplies to members , co @@@ -@@ @ operatives should pay a lot attention to making them understand that a credit has to be paid back .
in the NIS , producers sometimes tend to forget this .
it is very important to understand that credit activities are potentially dangerous for any co @@@ -@@ @ operative : defaul@@ ted payments could seriously jeop@@ ar ­ dise a co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
► The experience in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e
the oil plant placed 400 tons of sun@@ flower oil at the disposal of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative , which had to market this oil to obtain cash in order to buy supplies .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative met a lot of difficulties in selling this oil , and finally signed a contract for sun@@ flower meal sales , which the oil plant agreed to lend instead of the oil .
nevertheless , as the fulfilment of this contract was due to take place after the delivery date of the supplies , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative applied for a short @@@ -@@ @ term bank credit .
the conditions proposed by the bank were very un@@ favourable , but the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's competitive edge was such that the con@@ di ­ tions made to the members remained attractive .
finally , thanks to the support of the oil plant , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative was able to fulfil with only a slight delay the orders placed by the producers .
unfortunately , at harvest time , the members of Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r had to deliver sun@@ flower seeds to the oil plant as repayment for the oil and meal .
some of them delayed in doing this .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
the more the co ­ operative is able to provide guarantees , the more efficient and secure it will be .
in exchange , this processing plant will require a guarantee from the co @@@ -@@ @ operative or from its members .
the risk is limited for the processing plant : sooner or later , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative will have to deliver raw materials to the plant .
the processing plant 's guarantee Is more reliable for the bank , and this will facilitate obtaining the bank guarantee and lessen its cost .
a guarantee system has to be set up with regard to : - compliance with creditor 's requirements - security for the co @@@ -@@ @ operative - ensuring costs are as low as possible .
furthermore , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative needs to be sure that the members will deliver their pro ­ Du@@ ce to repay the supplies .
therefore , for its own security , it needs a guarantee from the producers .
therefore , a casc@@ ade of guarantees have to be established .
purchasing / Suppl@@ ying contracts with members
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives offer a good way to step beyond bar@@ tering relations .
of course , the producer is also a member of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative and all the relevant clauses included in the statutes , as well as in the rules and regulations , apply to this transaction .
nevertheless , It is highly recommended that the relating clauses also figure in the con ­ tract , at least as a reminding .
provisional prices are worked out when establishing the co @@@ -@@ @ operative catalogue .
generally , at that stage , the precise purchasing price is known .
operational costs , such as transport and customs clearance have to be assessed precisely .
with regard to fuel , the price of which can vary a lot during the season , the provisional price should be Est@@ a ­ blis@@ hed several times a year , for example every third month .
if the inputs or machinery are purchased on credit , the cost of the credit , including guar@@ aun@@ tees , has also to be charged .
reb@@ ates and price compl@@ ements are determined at the end of the year .
the producer delivers 50 tons of sun@@ flowers , but the co ­ operative pays 1,@@ 600 $ : 600 of reb@@ ate plus 1,000 $ of complement of price .
marketing and processing
the higher these commit ­ ments are , the more efficiently the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can operate on the market .
marketing and processing are two key problems faced by private farmers .
in Novosibirsk , most newly created co @@@ -@@ @ operatives deal with marketing ( almost 70 % ) or with processing ( over 40 % ) .
without relevant commitments , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative C@@ AN@@ NOT operate .
the rules must be widely accepted by members .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative must be sure that the collected volumes will be sufficient to cover the fixed costs of processing , and particularly credit re@@ payments .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
harvest collection and storage are key factors for a co @@@ -@@ @ operative dealing with marketing and processing .
a ) ideally , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative should own its own storage facilities
so far , co @@@ -@@ @ operatives are unlikely to have their own storage facilities , as the investment would be too high .
B ) A valuable alternative might be found in establishing contracts with grain sil@@ os
conditions proposed by grain sil@@ os , who enjoy a monopoly , are generally very un@@ favourable .
as co @@@ -@@ @ operatives do not hold storage facilities , they should at least control the grain transport , in order to secure the deliveries .
in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e , some members of the Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ D@@ n@@ le@@ pr blamed transport problems for not being able to comply with their delivery obligations .
members may use their own means of transport for carrying their own produce - and even the produce of other members - and get reimbur@@ sed by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative for trans ­ port expenses .
but the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can also take delivery of the harvest at the farm storage with its own transportation means , or through the services of a haul@@ age comp@@ a ­ ny .
in this way , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's purchasing prices are equivalent to farm @@@ -@@ @ gate prices .
marketing a ) Market information is decisive
electronic networks ( such as RE@@ L@@ COM ) provide worthy information .
an information and advisory centre can also provide the co @@@ -@@ @ operatives with tailored market information services .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
27 b ) A co @@@ -@@ @ operative can also operate with the existing processing plants
local processing plants are traditional buyers but , because of their monopol@@ istic pos@@ i ­ tion , they often offer very un@@ favourable conditions .
processing plants lack raw materials , and may be motivated to secure their supplies through agreements with a co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives can also establish sales contracts with traders , in particular foreign traders .
however , close attention should be paid to delivery conditions and to logistical issues .
in the NIS , using railway transport and port facilities requires good know @@@ -@@ @ how and strong contacts .
D ) An adequate marketing strategy entails sharing the risks
operating with just a few clients Is risky : it is preferable to diversify the outlets .
postp@@ oning the sale of the harvest can be profitable , since the prices might increase ; but keeping the harvest entails storage costs , whilst keeping the money produces interest .
the trends of the market have therefore to be ca@@ u ­ ti@@ ously ap@@ praised , and a good balance between selling at harvest time and postp@@ oning the sale has to be done .
processing a ) A way of keeping added value at the production level
processing generates added value which can be retained by the producers , and a co ­ operative is the best organisation to achieve this .
however , as far as processing is concerned , extreme caution is recommended .
although processing varies from one product to another , processing is an activity where economies of scale can be huge : the larger the processing quantities are , the more pr@@ of ­ itable processing becomes .
small scale processing units generally have a poor level of efficiency in terms of quality and profitability .
B ) Pos@@ session of own processing capacity may be profitable
• market opportunities : the large State @@@ -@@ @ owned or recently privati@@ sed processing units lack responsiveness to the market , and actually leave some gaps in the market .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative Bu@@ kov@@ ina , which has invested in the relevant processing facilities , will easily find outlets for its hard cheese .
• existing facilities : many collective farms already have processing facilities which are not always used to full capacity .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative revived the plant and started operating su@@ c ­ cess@@ fully .
C ) Pi@@ ece @@@ -@@ @ work processing is an alternative
when such opportunities are not available , a good solution can be to develop partner ­ ships with existing processing plants and to set up piece @@@ -@@ @ work processing contracts .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives , which gather large volumes of produce , can bargain with the processing plants for special conditions .
in Bro@@ dy , L@@ vo@@ v Region , the canned pe@@ as processed by the plant - which is a member of the Bro@@ dy F@@ arm@@ ers ' Association - are marketed either directly by the members , or colle@@ c ­ tively by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e , the private farmers ' co @@@ -@@ @ operative In@@ k@@ orn signed a contract with the oil plant for piece @@@ -@@ @ work processing .
the conditions of this contract are much more favourable than those that might have been negotiated by the individual farms .
D ) Members ' rights to benefit from processing services are defined by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative
the capacity of a processing unit owned by a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is limited .
therefore , me@@ m ­ bers C@@ AN@@ NOT deliver as much produce as they may want to , but their rights to benefit from processing services are defined by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's rules .
the system in force in machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operatives applies to this situation : when joining the co @@@ -@@ @ operative , each member undertakes a delivery commitment , and takes shares in proportion with his subscription .
members are entitled to deliver products In proportion with their subscri@@ p ­ tion , but the quality of the produce should also be taken into consideration .
when dealing with processing , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative should pay attention to quality control .
this Is particularly true for dairy processing where a small quantity of poor quality milk may spoil the whole quantity of good milk , if they are mixed .
prices and terms of payment
as far as the members ' produce is concerned , a co @@@ -@@ @ operative which Is just starting , lack ­ ing working capital , can hardly make advance payments to the producers at delivery time .
at this stage , at least for non @@@ -@@ @ processed produce , the selling prices as well as most of the costs are known : the provisional price will be very close to the final one .
the situation is different for the products delivered as re@@ payments for the supplies pur ­ ch@@ ased on credit .
the provisional price is set out in the contracts established when the producer places his order - i.e. several months before the harvest .
at that time , the sell ­ ing price of inputs is known , as well as most of the expected costs .
the provisional price has to be established very cauti@@ ously , taking into account the possible drops in the mar ­ K@@ et .
at delivery time , a first complement of price , depending on the actual selling price , can be paid .
of course , in both situations , a complement of price will be determined according to the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's financial surplus , as described above .
when a co @@@ -@@ @ operative deals with processing , the provisional price can hardly be set according to the expected cost price .
a good solution is to set a provisional price based on the market price of the raw mater@@ i ­ al - for example , the price usually paid by the processing plants .
the added value result ­ ing from processing will be paid through the compl@@ ements of price .
for the producer , the main advantage is that he does not have to make any invest ­ ment .
nevertheless , the prevailing tariffs are very high .
the ac@@ re@@ age of a collective farm is generally sufficient to permit a full use of most kinds of equipment .
nevertheless , as very specific equipment is concerned , it can happen that a single collective farm does not use it fully .
in such a case the best solution is to use the services of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
the Bro@@ dy F@@ arm@@ ers Association brings together eight collective farms involved in green pe@@ as production .
each of them grows , on average , 40 to 50 has of green pe@@ as , whilst the har@@ vest@@ er capacity is up to 300 has .
the Bro@@ dy F@@ arm@@ ers Association has got two H@@ ar ­ vest@@ ers and provides its members with mechan@@ isation services for harvest .
what services can a co ­ operative offer ?
in Top@@ ori@@ v@@ tsi , Chem@@ ov@@ tsi region , Individu@@ als have on average 0.5 ha of private or@@ char@@ ds and rent 1.3 ha of or@@ char@@ ds from the collective farm .
they perform all hand operations , and the co ­ operative provides them with mechan@@ isation services for treatments ( together with chemical supplies ) , grass cutting and cultivation .
in Or@@ he@@ i district , Moldova , the vil ­ l@@ age co ­ operatives took over the machinery of the former collective farm and provide the small Individual farms with mechan@@ isation services .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
large scale 5 to 10,000 ha
small scale 1,000 ha

Q Can machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling and other activities such as input supply or market ­ ing , be incorporated in the same co @@@ -@@ @ operative ?
this issue was discussed within the In@@ k@@ orn co @@@ -@@ @ operative in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e , as the creation of a machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling department within the co @@@ -@@ @ operative was on the agenda .
in this case , to finance the required investment , members Inter@@ ested in receiving such services are required to buy extra shares , though the others are not .
the situation within the Bro@@ dy F@@ arm@@ ers ' Association is rather different .
table 7 : co @@@ -@@ @ operatives which mix machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling and input supply @@@ -@@ @ market ­ ing activities
• The optimal size for machinery pooling and for input supply and marketing are different
so as to offer services at as low a cost as possible , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to ensure that the equipment will be used at optimal capacity during all of the amor@@ tis@@ ation period .
therefore , each member subscri@@ bes to use of the equipment for a specified ac@@ re@@ age or time .
generally subscriptions for the use of a tractor are allocated on a time basis , though they are allocated on a per hectare basis for the other pieces of equipment .
each member commits himself to use the services of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative for a period of several years according to the subscriptions paid .
on the other hand , he has the right to benefit from the services according to his subscription .
he can also use the equipment In excess of whatever is specified In the subscription , but does not have priority with regard to their use for the work beyond the subscription spe@@ c ­ i@@ fications .
operating with non@@ members should be strictly limited
the total of members ' subscriptions should be equal to , or slightly less than the expected capacity of the equipment .
as machinery and equipment have a very direct influence on the organisation of work , possible conflicts must be kept to a minimum .
therefore the rules relating to the use of equipment , the responsibilities of each member and the planning of use have to precise ­ ly defined .
if the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is large enough , it can hire workers to operate the machinery and see to its maintenance .
the alternative is to lend the equipment to the farmer , who will drive it and remain responsible for its use and for possible damage .
responsibilities for the use and maintenance of the equipment must be clearly defined .
the condition of the equipment has to be carefully checked before and after use .
in a large scale machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operative , it is the manager or a worker appointed by him .
in a smaller scale machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operative , responsibility is shared among the members : for each piece of equipment , a particular member is made responsible .
he is in charge of storing and maintaining the piece of equipment in good condition and for checking its condition after use by other members .
the equipment purchased by the co ­ operative is financed by members ' shares , and most of the time by credit .
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
terms of payment for shares are , in this case , similar to terms of payment for equipment .
the price charged for the services must cover all the expenses and enable the co @@@ -@@ @ operative to replace equipment .
some principles on alternative forms of organisation : machinery rings
a machinery ring is a group of farmers who exchange mechanical equipment .
each of them owns pieces of machinery which they lend to each other .
machinery rings are based on the principle of complement@@ arity of the equipment individually owned by each member .
each member offers services to the others and receives services from them .
a tariff is set for each crop operation , generally not In money but in account units .
the balance can be carried over to the following season or cancelled through use of working days .

advisory Services a ) Ad@@ vice to input and machinery supply
B ) Ad@@ vice to marketing
what services can a co @@@ -@@ @ operative offer ?
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can also , of course , provide the members with advisory services in fields that are not directly linked to the other activities of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
but a co @@@ -@@ @ O@@ per ­ ative and an advice centre are two different things - and both of them are useful : in a co ­ operative , advisory services come together with the provision of other services .
generally , In a co @@@ -@@ @ operative , the cost of the advisory activities is not directly charged to the members , but included in the over@@ heads , and therefore financed through the other activities .
in Mel@@ it@@ opol , Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e region , calculations made with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria showed that a full advisory package would amount to about 1 gri@@ v@@ na per ton of collected sun@@ flower seeds , i.e. around 0.3 % of its value .
the provision of advisory services has no significant effect on the purchasing price paid to producers , and is regarded by the members as another advantage offered by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can hire the required specialists for implementing these advisory activ@@ i ­ ties .
another solution is to enter into a contractual relationship with an information and advisory centre which then acts as a sub@@ contractor to perform these services .
the Bro@@ dy F@@ arm@@ ers ' Association hired agr@@ onom@@ ists ; after having been trained by the T@@ ac@@ is project , who implemented the advisory activities .
in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e region , the advis@@ o ­ ry activities of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative In@@ k@@ orn and Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria are performed by the advisory c@@ en ­ T@@ re Ag@@ ro@@ T@@ av@@ ria , on the basis of a service contract .
main themes of this chapter
democratic decision @@@ -@@ @ making
therefore , except in small machinery pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operatives , the daily management has to be handed over to a sal@@ ari@@ ed executive manager .
the executive manager 's activity should be closely controlled by the producers and there should be a mutual trust and dialogue between the President and the Executive Manager . these are the keys to an efficient management .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative operates in a competitive market environment , which requires high levels of performance .
non @@@ -@@ @ profit principles and democratic decision @@@ -@@ @ making procedures are not enough to guarantee that the operating co @@@ -@@ @ operative will be profitable for its members .
efficient management is also a key condition for the success of such an organisation .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to implement tight cost control methods .
clear objectives have to be set for the management , and the gaps between objectives and achievements have to be constantly analysed .
the members however , have to be aware that achievement of the objectives does not depend only on the sal@@ ari@@ ed team , but also a lot on their own behaviour .
participation in the management of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is more efficient than cri@@ t ­ icism .
respecting rules and regulations
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives operate in a market environment , in competition with many commercial firms that have much greater financial means .
should the producers not feel themselves involved in the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's management , they will not comply with the rules and commitments , and the co @@@ -@@ @ operative would lose Its economic efficiency .
democracy in the management of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is a condition for its success .
it should be well pre ­ pa@@ red for and co @@@ -@@ @ operative members should be well informed in advance .
nevertheless , in a General Meeting , little discussion can take place .
it is not a place for reflection , but for approving ( or rejecting ) the decisions which have already been prepared .
the Board of Directors is too restricted and has no time to go thoroughly In@@ to every topic .
a good solution is to organise several Com@@ missions focused on selected topics that meet regularly .
commissions permit the involvement of a wider number of persons in the management of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
in a farmers ' co @@@ -@@ @ operative , most of the members should attend a Commission .
in a collective farms ' co @@@ -@@ @ operative , various representatives of the same col ­ l@@ ective farm can attend a Commission .
► The experience in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e
as a result , the manager departed from co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's management principles and became mo@@ ti ­ v@@ ated by personal interests , leading Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r towards failure .
lessons were learnt , and in other co @@@ -@@ @ operatives , this matter was stressed .
at In@@ k@@ orn , thorough discussions on the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's development strategy took place during the General Assembly , but did not reach any concrete agreement .
this approach was very fruitful .
figure 7 : the co @@@ -@@ @ operative decision @@@ -@@ @ making process
executive manager
the ideal manager is hard to find : he must have business ac@@ umen , be a good organis@@ er and help the co @@@ -@@ @ operative to define its long @@@ -@@ @ term strategy .
a detailed job description for all these functions ( except the technical ones because of their specificity ) is given in annex .
► The experience in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e
the difficulties faced by Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r resulted from priority being given to the com ­ mer@@ cial function over relations with producers .
his two assistants were also involved in commercial and logistics issues , and nobody was in charge of relations with producers .
lessons were learnt , so that when creating Inter@@ T@@ av@@ ria , the manager was selected with regard to his relations with members .
the members should be aware that one man C@@ AN@@ NOT do everything , and they will have , at the beginning , to take part in the performance of the tasks .
then , the larger the volume of activity , the more important staff needs to be and the higher over@@ heads that the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can afford will be .
each managerial function has to be assigned to somebody , of course many combinations are possible , depending on the needs of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative and the personal skills available .
there is no general organ ­ isation chart that can be applied to any situation .
as members generally lack experience , the need for external assistance is obvious .
mistakes can jeopar@@ dise the co @@@ -@@ @ O@@ per ­ ative .
an adviser can contribute his skills and provide with an external point of view which can be decisive .
it Is required of course by every creditor , but it is even more necessary to provide the co ­ operative itself with guidance in its decision making .
nevertheless , it has some specific features which result from its SP@@ E ­ ci@@ fic principles .
items which are specific to co @@@ -@@ @ operative business planning are presented in annex .
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is not an enterprise like others .
it is ruled by some specific principles , such as non @@@ -@@ @ profit orientation , democracy and compliance with rules and commitments .
several advisory centres already exist in Ukraine , and fourteen of them participate in a network , which exchanges experience and information .
among them , the Advisory Centre Ag@@ ro@@ T@@ av@@ ria in Mel@@ it@@ opol particularly focuses on support to co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
Ag@@ ro@@ T@@ av@@ ria fostered the creation of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria and provided it with assistance for statute elaboration , registration , negotiation with suppliers and cred@@ i ­ tors , establishment of contracts with members and partners .
the Centre implements agr@@ onom@@ ic trials on members ' farms , so as to be able to advise the co @@@ -@@ @ operative about the selection of supplies .

main themes of this chapter
the first step consists in setting up a group of producers and providing them with in@@ for ­ mation and training about co @@@ -@@ @ operative principles .
starting a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is not an easy process : the more homogeneous and united the group is , the stronger the co @@@ -@@ @ operative will be when facing problems .
the preparation stage Is also a mat@@ uration process , during which the producers will pro ­ gres@@ sively realise what a co @@@ -@@ @ operative involves .
in Mel@@ it@@ opol , Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e Region , the creation of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria was su@@ p ­ ported by the Advisory Centre .
the experience of Ag@@ ro@@ Dni@@ ep@@ r , which failed , was Th@@ or ­ ough@@ ly analysed , so as to avoid the same mistakes .
the preparation stage must be organised so as to make it as fruitful as possible .
main issues to be debated
both collective farms and private farmers could largely benefit from the creation of co ­ operatives .
the question at stake is whether they should be members of a same co ­ operative , or if they should create separate co @@@ -@@ @ operatives ( Table 10 ) .
table 10 : private farmers and collective farms together in the same co @@@ -@@ @ operative
• General mistrust in relations between collective farms and private farmers .
• The efficiency of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative results from grouping producers ' supply needs and their offer of products ; private farmers will benefit from the economic weight of collective farms .
• dis@@ proportion of size involving management problems ( share capital , voting rights , representation of both types of agricultural entities in elec@@ tive boards ) .
• Coll@@ ective farms have also specific needs : problems with the social sphere , how to give incentives to the president and specialists .
the decision will depend on the local context : personal relationships between private farmers and collective farm managers , possible syner@@ gy between both systems , average ac@@ re@@ age and numbers of each .
range of activities
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative can be specialised in one particular type of production or in several , and specialised in one type of service or in several ( multi@@ purpose co ­ operatives ) .
a way to offer top quality services is to start with a limited range of activities .
• Management is simpler ( pricing sys ­ tem , reduced staff , more hom@@ o@@ ge ­ ne@@ ous members ) .
• Produc@@ ers need to be members of several co @@@ -@@ @ operatives , and therefore have less time to be involved in man ­ agement .
• If the activity in which the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is involved should face critical pro@@ b ­ l@@ ems , the whole co @@@ -@@ @ operative would be jeopar@@ dis@@ ed .
• Econom@@ ies of scale , making it poss@@ i ­ B@@ LE to develop more services ( of better quality ) for the members ( advisory ser ­ v@@ ices , market information ) .
the determination of the share capital results from the definition of the services , since they will determine needs for financing investments and working capital .
in Novosibirsk , the share capital depends on the objective of each co ­ operative . the amounts range from 8 million R@@ b ( US $ 1,500 for the milk sector ) to 1,500 million R@@ b ( for meat processing ) .
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is ruled by some specific principles , which must be translated into legal terms .
• Ad@@ mission of new members
the situation is different in a machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operative , where human relations between members are of utmost importance .
therefore , except In the case of machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operatives , admission of new members should be straightforward and frequent .
nevertheless , the hypothesis of ex@@ cl@@ u ­ sion , or the voluntary departure of co @@@ -@@ @ operative members also have to be considered in the statutes .
the capital of a co ­ operative varies frequently .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives are based on the principle " one man - one vote , " which guarantees that the co @@@ -@@ @ operative operates in the interest of all members , whatever the size of their farms .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative cares as much for a small farmer as for a large one .
the rule is : one member -@@ one vote .
figure 8 : President and manager : a tandem where everyone is in his right place o@@ F@@ j@@ ne ( ù@@ c@@ fee@@ AT@@ w@@ ç ;
these powers have to be strictly defined in the statutes , which is the sole document that can be requested by the co ­ operative partners .
• U@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation of the financial result
in the co ­ operative , a part of the provisional result is distributed to the members in the form of complement of prices and reb@@ ates .
this should not be regarded as a profit , and therefore not submitted to taxation .
the final result is obtained once reb@@ ates and compl@@ ements of prices are paid .
it can be used for reserves and possibly payment of dividends ­ but these should be strictly limited in a co ­ operative .
corresponding clauses should be included in the statutes .
two different situations presently exist , according to the country :
O Where a specific legislation on agricultural co @@@ -@@ @ operatives already exists
when a legislation on agricultural co @@@ -@@ @ operatives exists , it has to be used , even if it is so far not fully satisfactory .
some of the NIS countries ( Russia , Ukraine ) have recently passed legislation concerning agricultural co ­ operatives .
the law provides for an acceptable statute of the co ­ operative , but so far nothing has been improved relating to taxation issues .
whatever the deficiencies are , this form of legal entity is the best avail ­ able .
the groups of producers who intend to create a new co ­ operative should use this new statute .
later on , their experience will be useful in contributing to new improvements to the legislation .
several types of legal structure may be used , on condition that certain specific features are provided for in the statutes , and in the rules and regulations .
in Russia , Novosibirsk region , the Ni@@ va and Nad@@ ezh@@ da have the statutes of a co @@@ -@@ @ opera ­ tive , Agr@@ or@@ ust is a limited company , Com@@ et and Su@@ z@@ un Mil@@ k are associations .
in Ukraine , Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r is an additional liability company , Bro@@ dy ¡ s a F@@ arm@@ ers ' Association and Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria is a limited company .
in Moldova , Or@@ he@@ i district , village co @@@ -@@ @ operatives such as J@@ ub@@ ert , have been created as consumers ' co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
all these issues are strategic , since they are directly linked to the way in which the co @@@ -@@ @ operative will operate .
the statutes have to fit the main orient@@ ations of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative project as agreed by the members .
but this " translation " is not always accurate , because of the con ­ str@@ aints of the legislation .
it has therefore to be checked by the initiative group : several sessions between the initiative group and the legal expert are necessary .
the statutes C@@ AN@@ NOT easily be updated .
therefore , they should not include any clause that might have to be changed later on : such clauses are to be detailed in the Rules and Regulations .
it is difficult to say how long the preparation stage will last : it depends on the local situ@@ a ­ tion and on the pace of the producers ' reflection .
experience shows that once the pro ­ duc@@ ers are informed about co @@@ -@@ @ operative principles , a further period of about six months is required .
this process lasts two to three months .
before operating , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative still needs human and financial resources .
the man ­ ager and the staff have to be carefully selected , but this can be done during the previous stage .
if no new investment is planned , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can start operating straight away .
if the co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to apply for credit , this can require at least another six months .
the second solution is preferable , since it gives plenty of time to work on the project du@@ r ­ ing the winter .
conclusion
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives differ a lot from commercial enterprises .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is therefore based on some principles , which involve specific management methods .
in Europe , after years and years , co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have become leading enterprises .
progressively , they have adapted their management methods to their size and to the market requirements .
competition between co @@@ -@@ @ operatives and commercial firms has less@@ ened their differences : in order to attract producers ' deliveries , commercial firms are compelled to propose conditions as favourable as those of co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
some pro@@ du ­ CER@@ s complain that co @@@ -@@ @ operatives do not always operate in the interests of their me@@ m ­ bers .
however , in most cases , the co @@@ -@@ @ operatives respect the co @@@ -@@ @ operative spirit , even if some flexibility is required .
producers , who have a strong democratic experience , take care of that .
co @@@ -@@ @ operatives are weak , and the market Is dominated by ag@@ ri@@ business firms .
producers lack democratic experience , and are Gen@@ er ­ ally reluctant to comply with commitments and contracts .
therefore , there is a consider ­ able risk that a co @@@ -@@ @ operative may fail or devi@@ ate from its original objectives .
this is the key to su@@ c ­ c@@ ess .

the first stage of developing a business plan is the definition of the overall strategy .
this can result only from a wide consultation of the members .
working In Com@@ missions is a good way to achieve this .
market analysis and market strategy
the marketing strategy will mainly depend on the volume collected by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
this is determined by the delivery commitment defined within the Rules and Regulations , and on membership development .
it is " price @@@ -@@ @ t@@ aker , " and not a " price @@@ -@@ @ maker . "
the analysis will consist in identifying and assessing various channels .
should the co ­ operative intend to deal with per@@ ishable commodities ( animal products , fruit and veget@@ a ­ bles ) or with processing , and market its products through local channels , a thorough market analysis would be required .
at the input level , as far as input supply and machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling activities are concerned , it is the members who are the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's market .
the rules and regulations related to members ' activity commitment are a decisive element .
the prospects for membership development should also be assessed .
the whole range of services has to be defined .
not all services have to be offered as from the first year of operation .
the business plan must clearly mention long @@@ -@@ @ term dev@@ el ­ op@@ ment : this will be a source of motivation for everybody .
particular attention should be paid to transport and storage .
should the co @@@ -@@ @ operative intend to have its own processing facilities , a thorough analysis should be carried out : description should be made of the equipment and civil works requirements , nominal capacity , production planning and maintenance envisaged .
finance
indeed , the profitability of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative project C@@ AN@@ NOT be demonstrated by its financial results since the co @@@ -@@ @ operative does not aim at making profit for itself .
therefore , the positive impact of co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's services on member @@@ -@@ @ farms ' profitability should be assessed in order to demonstrate the interest of the project .
this result Is the major concern for the members .
it is also of importance for creditors , since the profitability of members ' farms is a condition of repayment .
cash flow state ­ ments for the co @@@ -@@ @ operative as well as for the farms attest to the capacity of the co @@@ -@@ @ O@@ per ­ ative to face its operating expenses and re@@ payments .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for know @@@ -@@ @ how to support the process of transformation to market economies and democratic societies .
T@@ AD@@ S works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and priorities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and International organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AD@@ S is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ Investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AD@@ S promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organisations In the partner countries and their counterparts In the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
since 1991 , useful work , In a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ AD@@ S programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more visible benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular Ide@@ ology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .

why set up an energy management training centre ?
modem management skills are vitally needed to make best use of scarce energy resources .
the emerging market economies of the New Independent States and Mongolia are facing the adoption of realistic world scale energy pricing In place of the previous abundant low cost supplies .
energy management skills are vitally needed in industry and building management to make efficient use of scarce resources .
this brochure describes the development of a training centre for energy management and its role In meeting national training needs , taking as an example the experience of the Kiev centre In Ukraine .
energy situation in NIS
since Independence In 1991 , many NIS countries have remained highly dependent on non @@@ -@@ @ domestic sources for their energy supplies .
in Ukraine , for example , up to 90 % of its fuel , mainly oil and gas , is imported from Russia .
before 1991 , Ukraine used to receive its energy supplies in exchange for agricultural and Industrial products - now they must be paid for in hard currency at world prices .
declining Industry and trade means that most NIS countries can no longer afford the level of energy Im@@ ports previously used to sustain its economy .
in addition , energy consumption per unit GDP is very high in NIS .
in many cases , It represents about twice the average of the European Union .
this is a consequence of the for mer low cost energy policies which neg@@ ated any economic incentive for an efficient use of energy .
the transition to a market @@@ -@@ @ orient@@ ated economy Is bringing more realistic energy pricing and access to new investment .
however , modernisation of the existing processes and buildings stock requires intensive Investment and will only be possible in the medium and long term as the NIS economies strengthen .
efficiency actions and investments will not be made without necessary skills updating .
without updating the necessary skills and competencies of business and energy management , these efficiency actions and Investments will not be realised .
trained energy specialists are needed to manage energy resources , implement energy @@@ -@@ @ saving plans and seek out Investment opportunities for energy efficiency projects .
the Governments of most NIS countries are promoting a rational and efficient use of energy In all sectors of the economy .
this is part of the continuing economic market reforms and is seen as a way out of the present energy crisis .
industrial and management training Is not widely available In Ukraine . this type of training is a cy@@ c@@ lic process , In@@ vol@@ ving regular re @@@ -@@ @ tr@@ al@@ ning and skills development .
it is often at odds with the traditional university environment with Its academic and research @@@ -@@ @ orient@@ ated approach which can appear of little direct relevance to managers In industry .
why set up an energy management training centre ?
this training should include energy efficiency technologies and market orient@@ ated management skills and should provide an accredited energy manager speci@@ alisation .
the shorter term aim of an energy training centre is to provide a national spear@@ head In energy management training and a regional focus for activities in the area where the centre is located .
the project will also develop relevant training modules and successfully complete the first year of training .
the project has been implemented in close co @@@ -@@ @ operation with the State Committee of Energy Sav@@ ing and the Ministry of Science and Education .
the training centre
a modern facility helps but the main commodity is the training itself .
the Energy Management Training Centre has been located within the National Technical University of Ukraine ( NT@@ U@@ U ) in Kiev .
this university is a well @@@ -@@ @ known technical institution that can provide suitable facilities , experienced management staff and skilled trainers .
the area of the building occupied by the training centre has been fully refurb@@ ished to provide a modern venue with all necessary facilities for provision of interactive training and demonstration of energy management techniques .
establishing a modern training facility , equipped with audio @@@ -@@ @ visual technologies and demonstration ri@@ gs must not be seen In I@@ sol@@ ation .
in short provision of training is the key commodity of the Centre .
refurb@@ ishment of the building to demonstrate energy @@@ -@@ @ saving techniques
the training centre is housed within one floor of NT@@ U@@ U and Inclu@@ des offices and classrooms together with facilities for demonstration of energy efficient equipment .
it occupies an area of approximately 700 m2 , Inclu@@ ding a classroom , an exhibition hall , three offices and a library .
the building and installed demonstrations are used to explain modern energy management and efficiency techniques .
demonstration installations
the training centre It@@ self Is designed to provide a practical demonstration of how energy Is managed and energy savings achieved and monitored .
the Centre 's electricity and water utilities , and heating system , were separated from the main building services In order to monitor energy consumption .
isolation from the main heating system required Installation of a stand @@@ -@@ @ alone electric boiler - a stand @@@ -@@ @ alone gas boiler would not be permitted under current Ukrainian building regulations .
it can be used by the In@@ struc@@ tors to demonstrate different system operating patterns .
the advanced lighting control system Is also connected to the BE@@ MS .
the classroom Is equipped with scenario lighting , Inclu@@ ding dim@@ mers and curtain control .
lighting levels are linked to a light @@@ -@@ @ sensor on the weather station .
a particular series of ri@@ gs demonstrates the effect of different control and pi@@ ping options for the refurb@@ ishment of building single pipe heating systems and the Introduction of modern controls in residential buildings .
information technology and audio @@@ -@@ @ visual equipment
in addition to the technical demonstrations the Centre has modern Inter@@ active training equipment with audio @@@ -@@ @ visual technologies and personal computers .
the computers In the classroom can be operated as stand @@@ -@@ @ alone machines or as slaves to the In@@ struc@@ tor 's computer which also provides the main station for the BE@@ MS .
there is also access to the Internet for further research on savings opportun@@ iti@@ es@@ . tun@@ ities .
strong management is crucial if the Centre is to win commercial training business .
the training centre
the core of the management system ¡ s a database , which Is used to compile Information on staff@@ ing , training programmes , evaluation and expenditure .
it contains data on instructors and train@@ ees , target organisations , course results ( evaluation ) , course related materials , maintenance routines , budgets and expenditure .
administrative procedures for the Centre are all set out in a Management and Administrative Systems manual which is followed by Centre staff .
training activities
assessing training requirements
the training cycle
training materials are continually updated as energy management skills penetrate into enterprises .
training development is therefore a cy@@ c@@ lic process as shown in the Figure 1 .
the first priority of this T@@ ac@@ is project was to undertake an extensive " training needs assessment " to understand the level of skills , knowledge and attitudes related to energy management In the target organisations and sectors .
figure 1 : the training cycle
design of training interventions ( training packages )
those related to knowledge and skills gaps are re@@ formulated as training needs .
specific training objectives are developed and appropriate training courses and materials worked up .
each completed training activity is evaluated and revisions made to improve the training for subsequent deliveries .
in this way the training evol@@ ves on a continuous basis , and maintains Its relevance and effectiveness .
one of the first activities of an energy training centre should be to undertake a country wide training needs assessment .
the Institutions interviewed included industry sectors and enterprises , power utilities , Government organisations , universities and other Institutions .
the objective of the interviews was to collect data about the energy performance of enterprises and current levels of energy management skills .
the assessment Identi@@ fied many requirements for training , the most important being the provision of energy management skills .
traditional roles of energy managers were administrative . now new skills are necessary : management skills , motiv@@ ating staff , making investment applications .
many large enterprises already have a management appointment with responsibility for the purchase of the necessary energy supplies to meet production targets .
this has always been an Import@@ ant role , but the skills required are In the purchasing and scheduling of energy and are largely administrative .
they have had little experience in analysing projects and attracting and Implement@@ ing investments , as such matters were outside their rem@@ it .
now although management In Ukrainian enterprises has become more autonomous with moves towards privatisation , the critical shortage of capital Is cur@@ t@@ ailing Investment In new projects .
training activities awareness of staff , making economic evaluations and presentations for efficiency Inv@@ est ­ ments .
in the modern " energy management " role it is these demand Issues that dom@@ i ­ N@@ ate .

training activities
common structure and approach
a common structure has been developed for the training programmes .
this has been produced jointly by the European experts , the Centre 's task managers and the In@@ struc@@ tors .
each training programme Inclu@@ des a precise definition of the target group and clear objectives .
overall objectives are sub @@@ -@@ @ d@@ l@@ v@@ l@@ ded In@@ to more specific session objectives and topics .
the agreed training methodology Is applied to each topic , the required materials are specified and the time necessary for the training determined .
the uniform structure of the training programmes and their evaluation was developed not only to facilitate structured planning and consistency , but also to aid In the storage and reference of training materials .
this modular structure , with clearly defined objectives and topics , means that it is quite simple to combine different elements to make a bes@@ po@@ ke training course for specific client needs .
follow up and evaluation of each training programme are carried out in terms of quality , relevance and training methods used .
feedback is also sought on the degree to which participants ' expectations of the training were fulfilled , and to generate suggestions for Im@@ pro@@ vements to the training .
to complement this ongoing process of evaluation and refin@@ ement , broader reviews of the effectiveness of the training are carried out on a periodic basis , say every six months .
four training modules have been completed In the present T@@ ac@@ is project , and these have been done jointly by Centre staff and European experts .
each module has a standard approach which is set out In guidelines for the ongoing development and implementation of training programmes .
delivery of the first three courses comm@@ ences In Aut@@ umn 1997 , and the other training programmes will be developed subsequently .
training activities
building installation designers and engineers
architects and building designers Energy managers
local instructors develop the material and provide the training .
the philosophy of this T@@ ac@@ is training centre project was to develop highly skilled and experienced local In@@ struc@@ tors to deliver the future training for Ukrainian organisations .
28 instructors received training from European experts , and they will In turn provide the training directly to the targeted groups .
the style of training is highly participatory avoiding traditional " talk and chal@@ k " lec@@ turing making the sessions relevant and stimulating .
future training activities will also be carried out in this active learning style , making use of experience gained from Ukrainian projects to supplement other outside examples .
of the 28 instructors ten were selected from cities outside Kiev which represent major Ukrainian urban centres with the potential to establish regional energy management training centres .
the Centre In@@ struc@@ tors all received the qualification " Energy Management Tra@@ iner " accredited by the Ministry of Education .
at present this qualification is only available from NT@@ U@@ U and this demonstrates the Government 's support for establishing the Centre as the focus of energy management training in Ukraine .
the 28 In@@ struc@@ tors are the key to the forward training programmes .
they will provide all future training and will continue to develop and refine the training programmes and course material .
the quality of the training Is vital to the Centre 's reputation and credibility , and instructors were carefully selected with regard to their professional profiles and their experience in training and education .
the main requirements were energy engineering qualifications , energy management experience , knowledge of policy Issues and good training skills .
the initial training provided by European experts differs considerably from the training programmes that will be offered to the target groups .
the secondary and tertiary target groups are outside the scope of the present T@@ ac@@ is project .
however , they indicate the huge size of the potential audience for energy manage ment training .
figure 3 : training is casc@@ aded to target groups by the training centre instructors
primary Target Groups : industry , NT@@ U@@ U teaching staff , students
secondary and Ter@@ tiary Groups : beyond the scope of this T@@ ac@@ is project
initial training is prioriti@@ sed to key target groups .
the Kiev Training Centre does not possess the capacity to provide training all of the organisations in Ukraine that would benefit from energy management training .
it Is planned as a focus for the Kiev region and to support training in other regional Centres around Ukraine .
each centre will also act as the national focus for particular industry sectors and develop tailored courses for those industries .
training activities
the Centre plans to provide up to 200 days training each year for groups of up to 20 people .
as a guide , if these were all three day courses , this represents training for around 1,@@ 330 individuals .
however , the demand for training will be determined by the willingness and ability of the enterprises , or other Government and International organisations , to fund the training .
however , interest In the training courses is high from both State and private enterprises .
each option has Import@@ ant economic consequences and Impl@@ ications for the Centre 's autonomy and longer term sustainability ( Figure 4 ) .
figure 4 : comparison of the three options
public funding ( university budget ) remains essential
2 Par@@ tial autonomy within the framework of NT@@ U@@ U
contract negotiated with NT@@ U@@ U on : buildings , equipment , personnel , profits , deficits , training of regular students
the preferred option by the European experts , NT@@ U@@ U and the Ministry of Education was for the training centre to have partial autonomy within the framework of the NT@@ U@@ U .
partial autonomy also means that Centre staff retain their employment status within NT@@ U@@ U thereby reducing the risk to staff in participating In further development of the Centre .
the final institutional status of the training centre has been agreed as a separate branch of the Institute for Energy Sav@@ ings and Energy Management ( IE@@ SE@@ M ) within NT@@ U@@ U .
on completion of the T@@ AD@@ S project the Centre will be given financial autonomy within NT@@ U@@ U and all of the equipment proc@@ ured under the project will be retained by the Centre .
the Centre will ultimately have full financial and managerial autonomy within the NT@@ U@@ U .
the partial autonomy status means that ultimately the State authorities are the principal stakeholders In the Centre through the University .
at present relations with other universities are complementary without any competitive threat .
other organisations may wish to develop energy management training , but with out fully accredited status .
these costs will not be recover@@ able from commercial training provision , and the instructors have been provided with training at no charge .
this cost has also been born by the T@@ AD@@ S project .
the training centre is not charged rent for Its premises within NT@@ U@@ U , In@@ stead It provides an agreed amount of student training free .
this arrangement will be re@@ negotiated as the training activities expand .
the facilities of the Centre are also available at suitable market rates for use by other organisations Inclu@@ ding international projects .
many donations of demonstration equipment have been received at no cost from Western companies presently operating In Ukraine or wishing to trade within the area .
other equipment has also been provided at cost price only .
local enterprises have expressed their support and willingness to provide equipment but , due to the current difficult financial position , have not been able to make contributions .
Western companies and local enterprises have helped with equipment donations and development of training material .
organisational and financial autonomy is an important cornerstone for the training centre .
another key consideration for the future will be Its financial stability - i.e. the Centre 's ability to generate enough money to cover costs .
the short term objective is to generate sufficient income to cover ongoing costs .
it C@@ AN@@ NOT be expected that the revenue received from provision of commercial training would be sufficient to repay capital costs for the Centre .
this would be difficult even in a well functioning Western economy .
long term success and expansion to set up additional training centres Is inextr@@ icably linked to economic recovery In the NIS region .
if the economy 's present stagnation continues for a number of years the Centre 's sustain@@ ab@@ ill@@ ty will have to be re @@@ -@@ @ defined , and alternative sources of financing will have to be sought .

the main difficulties encountered by the project arose from a lack of appreciation of the concept and role of the energy manager amongst Ukrainian Government .
effort was needed to convince officials as to the value to Ukraine of embar@@ king on this strategic direction .
the team used examples of Danish and UK practice to ex@@ to@@ l the benefits and resistance was overcome through protracted negotiations with officials .
obtaining the necessary lic@@ ences for accreditation of the courses also required a major effort in producing the necessary documentation to cover training of each of the target groups - In@@ struc@@ tors , students , managers in industry , etc .
the State Council includes independent national experts and representatives of relevant Ministries .
it has direct control over all purchasing , income received and operational decisions
• support and close involvement of relevant government bodies - many Ministers as former students of the NT@@ U@@ U maintain close ties to the University .
the Centre is therefore developing a client base that Inclu@@ des International A@@ gencies , In@@ stitutes , State Committees and U@@ tilities
conclusion
energy plays a critical role In industrial and economic development and NIS governments are recogn@@ ising the crucial importance of improving the way energy is used In all sectors of the economy .
energy management skills are crucial in the modernisation of energy systems throughout the NIS .
much can be achieved through more efficient operation and maintenance of existing equipment and systems , and through upgrading processes with modern control systems , In@@ sul@@ ation and heat recovery .
the training centre and training programmes established within this T@@ ac@@ is project in Ukraine aim to provide this vitally needed training in energy management techniques and efficiency technologies .
its primary targets are the industry and commercial sectors , not only energy managers but State inspectors and system designers .
it will provide a focus for energy management in Ukraine and , by the high quality of the training provided and the training facilities offered , is already gaining a strong reputation and credibility throughout the region .
since its opening , the Centre has steadily grown its reputation for high quality and relevant training .
its success In the longer term will be proved by Its ability to attract commercial training activities , to cover the expenses of running the Centre and to develop new training activities .
a second T@@ AD@@ S project will assist the Centre In this transition period of two years whilst the commercial markets for training are tested , additional training modules developed and the reputation of the centre established .
should the demand prove sufficient , the In@@ tention is to establish a network of up to 10 further regional Energy Management train ing centres .
it Is planned that this network of centres will provide regional coverage .
each centre will also act as the national focus for particular industry sectors and develop tailored courses for those industries .
the anticipated network of regional centres will also be based on Universities with recognised interests in energy saving and related activities .
each will have regional responsibility for its surrounding area and national responsibility for particular sectors of Industry .
any other organisation wishing to develop a training centre will need to demonstrate specific interests in particular regions or industries .
all centres will require a strong Director with a known reputation .

T@@ AC@@ IS does this by providing grant finance for kno@@ wh@@ ow to support the process of trans ­ formation to market economies and democratic societies .
T@@ AC@@ IS works closely with the partner countries to determine how funds should be spent .
this ensures that T@@ ac@@ is funding is relevant to each country 's own reform policies and pr@@ i ­ orities .
a part of broader international effort , T@@ ac@@ is also works closely with other donors and international organisations .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides kno@@ wh@@ ow from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
T@@ AC@@ IS is also a catalyst , un@@ locking funds from major lenders by providing pre @@@ -@@ @ investment and feasibility studies .
T@@ AC@@ IS promotes understanding and appreciation of democracy and a market @@@ -@@ @ oriented social and economic system by cultivating links and lasting relationships between organ ­ isations in the partner countries and their counterparts in the European Union .
each country then chooses the priority sectors depending on its needs .
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
in particular , practical field work , with more vis@@ i ­ B@@ LE benefits , has been conducted on a more systematic basis since 1993 .
a number of projects were successful in developing and testing possible solutions to help partner countries adjust to a market economy .
the content of this document is one such action .
documents edited by T@@ DP are not coloured by a particular ideology or political doctrine , and they do not intend to prescri@@ be any one solution to a problem .
what is reflected are merely the results achieved in a given situation , and the details of tools used to good effect by local people in adjusting to their changing environment .
replication of these results is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
situations can be similar , but are seldom identical .
this brochure was developed on the basis of the experience and results achieved by the project described here@@ after .
various T@@ ac@@ is projects have worked / are working on support to the restructuring of enterprises in NIS countries .
the aim of the brochure is to provide references and help to enterprises ' managers and shareholders faced with similar difficulties as the ones which were plagu@@ ing the enterprise described in the presented cases .
what is enterprise restructuring ?
En@@ tre@@ prise restructuring and economic recovery
enterprise reform is a central and indispensable component of overall economic reform in countries of central and eastern Europe , and of recovery of growth .
unless enterprises become efficient and profitable , even well @@@ -@@ @ designed and vigorously implemented macro @@@ -@@ @ economic reforms will not result in a successful transformation of the economy ( see Figure 1 ) .
figure 1 : enterprise restructuring and economic recovery
economic recovery t
former State enterprises , even when privati@@ sed , are resilient to changes ; they can hold the reform process and the State budget hostage .
privatisation programmes have some ­ how progressed ( at a slower pace in Ukraine than in Russia ) , but the strategy for owner ­ ship reforms , and restructuring of enterprises has still to be defined .
restructuring of privati@@ sed enterprises has proved very difficult , especially when the ownership had been transferred to managers and employees .
there is a general agreement that enterprises C@@ AN@@ NOT survive without restructuring .
but how to implement It with success is very difficult .
most enterprises have seen their sales drop by a F@@ AC ­ tor of 50 or more per cent if compared to 1990 , and they understand that they C@@ AN@@ NOT rely anymore on the State to save them .
many enterprise managers have dreamed of the white k@@ night foreign investor , bringing money , but not interfering in the management .
with time , hopes have faded , and managers and shareholders are now realistic .
they recognise that they have to create their own future , and restructuring of their enterprise is going to be one of the first steps in this direction .
what is enterprise restructuring ?
in the US , following the agricultural crisis of the sev@@ enti@@ es / early eigh@@ ties , many agricultural machinery producers were in deep trouble , without market .
the different phases in enterprise restructuring
there are many ways to approach restructuring .
it may encompass many aspects which can be addressed in parallel or phased depending on the situation of the enterprise , the sector and the economic environment .
restructuring is not continuously complaining about the current situation and hoping that God or somebody in the Centre will improve the situation .
it sec@@ ures the future of the enterprise through the implementation of more ambitious projects requiring significant financing .
( 1 ) rapidly means within some 10 to 12 months .
what is enterprise restructuring ?
figure 2 : the different phases in enterprise restructuring
investment in human resources
it usually addresses key weaknesses of former soviet enterprises entering the market economy , namely market and sales , finance , organisation , etc .
► Organ@@ is@@ ational and managerial issues
the initial phase may require very low investment of money , but high investment of the management to implement the required organisation changes .
it can be implemented rapidly using internal resources of the enterprises .
► Physical / assets restructuring and operational changes
very often enterprises are affected by a poor layout of the plant and by rigi@@ di@@ ties in pro ­ duction due to the tradition of long production bat@@ ches .
the second phase of restructuring addresses other aspects which may be initiated .
it is a necessary measure for enterprises over@@ loaded with debts . however , creditors will not accept to initiate it in the absence of a credible plan for overall restructuring and recovery .
the Investment activity may also cover invest ­ ments to obtain the certification for new standards .
► investments in human resources
investments in human resources are necessary , especially in the sales / marketing and finance areas ( e.g. recruitment of a top sales@@ man or a finance manager ) .
this may cover mergers with enterprises having com@@ ple ­ m@@ entary productions and markets , spin @@@ -@@ @ off of unrelated activities , concentration of share ­ holders through various means .
conditions for a successful enterprise restructuring
in the absence of such com ­ mit@@ ment , any attempt to restructure a company will quickly ab@@ ort as the most important measures will not be taken by the management and the shareholders .
but in addition to it , any attempt to restructure a company without having the people / workers on your side will quickly ab@@ ort .
the management group must recognise that the enterprise is facing a new challenge and / or is presenting symptoms of illness .
but in@@ her ­ itance from the past soviet system indicates a few recurrent syn@@ dro@@ mes identified in many enterprises .
managers or shareholders must be convinced that they are not alone with the problems they are facing in their company .
( 1 ) Very often , in the western literature covering restructuring , restructuring of ailing industries facing hard competition from new entrants ( e.g. ship@@ yards , steel industry ) is called defensive restructuring .
why are the customers willing ( or not willing ) to buy products Χ , Υ , Ζ from our factory ?
outside assistance ( local or foreign ) is necessary to accelerate the implementation of a restructuring programme .
the consultants will act as cataly@@ sts , and will stimulate the recovery process of the enterprise .
working with consultants is resource consuming for the enterprise .
to maxim@@ ise the adv@@ ices provided by the consultants , the manager has to allocate one or several professionals to work with the consultants so as to help them to make the diagnosis as quickly as possible .
the professionals will also gain an immense experience and they will later disseminate their kno@@ wh@@ ow to their colleagues .
they will be the pivotal team of the enterprise to implement restructuring .
what should the management expect from external assistance ?
• The consultants can help greatly in the elaboration of the diagnosis and in rec@@ om ­ men@@ ding measures to be implemented to improve the situation , as well as coaching during the implementation phase .
• They will help bench@@ marking the enterprise vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis its competitors .
but in the most important phase , the implementation , the staff of the enterprise should be In the fore front , with the constant support of the consultants ' team .
but external assistance C@@ AN@@ NOT solve all problems .
consultants do not know the enter ­ prise better than its managers .
their role is summar@@ ised in Table 1 .
a consultant C@@ AN@@ NOT :
a few cases illustr@@ ating various industries
the cases presented in the Table 2 ( and detailed in the following chapters of this brochure ) illustrate successful restructuring initiated with the assistance of T@@ ac@@ is projects .
they cover enter@@ pr@@ is ­ es of different sizes , in@@ .@@ Russia and in Ukraine , enterprises of different origins from all@@ union to local enterprises .
the managers and the shareholders of these enterprises are willing to share their unique experience with their colleagues .
the diagnosis and the proposed remedies show a lot of similarities in each enterprise .
not surprisingly , marketing and sales ¡ s a problem in all enterprises .
it is too early to speak of results as some of the projects have just been finished , while others finished more than a year ago .
however , it is interesting to see that there are results , even when the prognosis was not very favourable at the onset of the project .
those cases for which we have an hindsight , such as E@@ fre@@ mov , show that the restruc@@ tu@@ r ­ ing has been instrumental in securing financing for additional investments at a later stage .
financiers are not rushing to a company , but want to feel secure that their investments will be repaid thanks to the good strategy and management of the company .
many different European consulting firms have worked on these projects , transferring kno@@ wh@@ ow to enterprises and local consultants .

business managers and shareholders are key factors of change in NIS countries .
the work with enterprises and the success of restructuring would extend beyond the ind@@ i ­ vi@@ dual cases and the initial results which have been achieved , and are reported in this hand@@ book .
it is evident that there is a burgeoning demand for " restructuring , " or more precisely for Im@@ proving the situation of enterprises which are faced with unprecedented problems .
restructuring is a progressive process
• The first step is to carry out a SW@@ OT analysis ' ( Streng@@ ths , We@@ ak@@ nesses , Opportun@@ ities and Th@@ reat@@ s ) or similar analytical grid to collect Information on sales , finance , pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion , personnel .
sometimes , the diagnosis is very quick , sometimes it takes a longer time if the company is important , active in many businesses , has Se@@ v ­ eral production sites , etc .
• Recommend@@ ations will rapidly be formulated and in particular short term measures to be implemented immediately .
• Short term actions on sales and market , finance , product design , quality , house@@ keep ­ ing , cost control , show results very rapidly .
a very simple act of change is house@@ keeping .
so many plants are full of pieces of metal , wood or junk ; everything is ru@@ sting ; nothing is clean .
this can be changed almost overnight , and it will immensely improve the morale of workers .
short term actions are not sufficient , but the necessary step to ensure the success of the longer term restructuring .
an analysis of the examples provided in this brochure shows that it takes time to find real financial investors .
agreements with commercial partners are quicker ( not necessarily easier ) , and examples both in Russia ( Gav@@ r@@ ilov ) and in Ukraine ( Kiev San@@ itary Equipment ) demonstrate that they are feasible within a couple of months .
but Russian or Ukrainian enterprises have shown that they have significant possibilities of productivity improvements and cost savings .
it has to be understood by everybody , from the management team to the workers .
restructuring implies a major change in the enterprise .
this has required a lot of communication and information from the consultants at all levels .
in cases not reported In this brochure where the commun@@ i ­ c@@ ation had failed , the restructuring process has abor@@ ted .
their European col ­ leagues have often explained that they also had to go through restructuring , even if necessity is generally less drastic than in Russia or Ukraine .
the Russian or Ukrainian managers have gained confidence In the proposed restructuring process , and were able to share this confidence In the future with their colleagues and the workers .
some of the cases highlighted above have gone through such an " internal crisis , " but all have su@@ c ­ ce@@ eded to overcome It through dialogue and communication .
restructuring threatens the status @@@ -@@ @ quo as it requires changes from everybody .
there is therefore a need for a very deep co @@@ -@@ @ operation between the various actors to lessen ten ­ sions , and avoid misunderstandings .
this is also particularly true when the enterprise needs to get rid of social assets and services and to transfer them to the com ­ mun@@ ity .
as said above , the key to a successful restructuring is motivation for changes , and set ­ ting @@@ -@@ @ up joint task @@@ -@@ @ forces between the outside advisers and the enterprise staff .
( 1 ) The role of Russian and Ukrainian consultants is critical in this convincing .
it is difficult to identify criteria to measure success in advance , but in the long term , fin@@ an ­ cial sustain@@ abl@@ lity and improved profitability are certainly one criteria or THE criteria .
prospects for 1997 are excellent "
the cases presented in this hand@@ book all show most of these positive ind@@ i ­ cat@@ ors of success , which will enable the enterprises to build on their first effort .
the value of shares is not yet an indicator in Russia and Ukraine given the lack of liquidity and transparency of the capital market .
but it will certainly be an indicator in the future as it is in most western countries .
most companies with successful restructuring experience a significant increase in their share price .
this is very important for the company which will need to tap the financial markets to finance development and new investments .
a very important aspect ( although difficult to measure ) gained through the restructuring process is the adaptation to the reality and change of attitude .
several cases describe companies where managers were frustrated , and the morale very low ( the worst case was probably Car@@ pat@@ en in Ukraine ) .
in other words , the man ­ agement team and sometimes the workers have moved from a passive attitude to an active one .
training is essential in a restructuring process .
in all cases , one of the early diagnosis has been the lack of sales and marketing staff .
the ultimate resources of enterprises are the people , educated , trained engineers , and workers , which will have to ret@@ ool their approach to problem solving .
initial and significant quality improvements can be rapidly achieved by training and by communicating with the workers .
successful restructuring is a pre @@@ -@@ @ condition to attract investment financing
a clearly defined vision of the enterprise and a credible business plan are necessary to attract potential partners .
Russia and Ukraine are part of the world economy and face competition .
but they have advantages : large markets , not yet solvent , but which should enable a number of enter ­ prises to have economies of scale and lower costs .
furthermore , Russian enterprises have access to cheap and good quality raw materials ( wood , energy , metals for exam ­ PL@@ E ) .
of course , these markets will also attract competitors .
in some of the cases pre ­ s@@ ented above , the company has already found and negotiated with a partner .
in the case of textile , a joint venture is under negotiation .
the rubber company had already negoti@@ at ­ ed a joint venture , but was not capable to reap the fruit of the venture .
some of the ear ­ lier restructuring cases have also ended with significant partnership negotiated with a for ­ e@@ ign company ( Russian furniture company ) .
all the diagnosis work , and discussions with the management team , have led to the definition of a strategy .
while everybody recogn@@ ises that the issue of social assets is critical and has to be addressed , it is beyond the capabilities of the external assistance to help div@@ est them .
the Russian or Ukrainian companies have net only to dispose of social assets , but of assets not relevant to their core business . most companies have already initiated this process , and are moving towards a lean@@ er company .

in 1994 , production is running at best at a level of 5,000 t / month , 37 % of which being exported to the West .

case n ° 1 : E@@ fre@@ mov synthetic rubber ( E@@ Z@@ SK )
diagnosis by the consultants
the tyre industry is the main user of poly@@ but@@ adi@@ ene ( 87 % of sales ) .
the sold production of non ­ core products decreases sharply .
in its shrinking domestic market , E@@ Z@@ SK consistently loos@@ ing share ( 30 % market share in 1994 ) to Voron@@ esh Rub@@ ber Plant ( V@@ Z@@ SK ) who holds a 70 % market share .
the main rea ­ son is the higher willingness of V@@ Z@@ SK to trade on a bar@@ ter ­ basis .
the western market is dominated by Bay@@ er .
if all necessary actions are taken , E@@ Z@@ SK will most likely double export ton@@ nage by the year 2000 .
to this end E@@ Z@@ SK needs to cope with western consumer 's requirements .
E@@ Z@@ SK 's position must be improved on 4 out of 6 key success factors in this market .
positioning of E@@ Z@@ SK on the world market
importance in Western Markets
finance
E@@ Z@@ SK is geared towards its production capacity of 250 K@@ t per year .
under the current market and supply conditions , if no restructuring is performed overall cash flow will remain negative .
case n ° 1 : E@@ fre@@ mov synthetic rubber ( E@@ Z@@ SK )
cash flow of E@@ Z@@ SK in 1994
the losses from social services amount to 7 % of overall annual revenues and severely hamper the cash @@@ -@@ @ flow situation of E@@ Z@@ SK .
although technology @@@ -@@ @ wise E@@ Z@@ SK is competitive on world wide markets , the production structure of E@@ Z@@ SK is non @@@ -@@ @ integrated , non @@@ -@@ @ diversified and too large for present production levels .
focusing on core products ( solid poly@@ but@@ adi@@ ene ) should provide opportunities for optim@@ isation of production layout and costs .
• production capacity is being maintained for very low volume products that , there ­ fore , C@@ AN@@ NOT significantly contribute to the coverage of E@@ Z@@ SK 's fixed costs .
• " non core " activities still operated : ag@@ ro@@ hos@@ es , sil@@ ica powder , PE bags should be dis@@ continued .
they dil@@ ute management 's attention , without contributing significantly to E@@ Z@@ SK 's profitability .
there is need and scope for major organisational restructuring , including the traditional segments .
the plant presently employs 6,@@ 500 people , while social eng@@ ag@@ ements account for 1,@@ 350 people .
case n ° 1 : E@@ fre@@ mov synthetic rubber ( E@@ Z@@ SK )
based on the above diagnosis and following recommendations , mixed teams E@@ Z@@ SK / consultants were constituted and jointly searched for applicable practical solutions .
a restructuring plan with targets , tasks , timetable , responsibility , budget and training needs has been developed to cover the immediate needs of E@@ Z@@ SK .
as raw materials represent 75 % of the cost of production of poly@@ but@@ adi@@ ene , competitive and reliable supplies are key to E@@ Z@@ SK 's viability .
today 's supplies come exclusively from Tob@@ ol@@ os@@ k petrochemical complex .
additional Russian supplies ' have to be found .
E@@ Z@@ SK has to re@@ design the supply basis to ensure a constant supply of but@@ adi@@ ene required on competitive price base .
this required the following tasks : - definition of a multi source but@@ adi@@ ene supply strategy - re@@ negotiating actual contract terms - optim@@ isation of logistic costs .
it was necessary to adapt the organisation to " core business " needs and rethink critical processes .
( 1 ) Gi@@ ven the cash @@@ -@@ @ flow situation of E@@ Z@@ SK , sourcing from western suppliers is not realistic .
case n ° 1 : E@@ fre@@ mov synthetic rubber ( E@@ Z@@ SK )
- streamline the key business processes - develop human resources - transfer social assets .
situation at the end of the consulting project a ) Sales results and medium term perspective
in contrast to 1994 , production of poly@@ but@@ adi@@ ene Is running at 9,000 / 10,000 tons per month ( as opposed to 5,000 tons per month ) .
sales go predominantly to the West , Russian business being stagnant at 1,000 / 2,000 tons per month .
business development by K@@ aut@@ sch@@ uk@@ g@@ es@@ ell@@ sc@@ ha@@ ft during 1994 has paid off very well .
E@@ Z@@ SK Is now certified with all relevant tyre manufacturers in the West .
exports to the USA also work out financially .
medium term E@@ Z@@ SK 's sales are likely to stabil@@ ise , as 1995 production level reached a si@@ g ­ nific@@ ant market share in western European market .
revival of the Russian market that would also boost E@@ Z@@ SK 's sales is even harder to predict .
B ) R@@ aw material supply
E@@ Z@@ SK is now supplied under four contracts , only one of them having a hard currency ele ­ ment .
E@@ Z@@ SK 's position is also helped by the much improved cash position .
this allows E@@ Z@@ SK to finance export business both from the western border to customers and for the time from the product leaving the factory to arrival at the western distribution terminal .
this results in E@@ Z@@ SK receiving cash payments for their export production once products leave the manufacturing production .
general profitability and additional credit facilities greatly improve E@@ Z@@ SK 's purchasing position .
D ) Long term finance
a $ 20 million investment plan Inclu@@ ding plant efficiency Im@@ pro@@ vement , product and tech ­ n@@ ology development , new product manufacturing and improved maintenance has been prepared by E@@ Z@@ SK .
discussions are held with EBRD to finance the investment .
case π ° 1 : E@@ fre@@ mov synthetic rubber ( E@@ Z@@ SK )
situation two years after the end of the consulting project
Con@@ tr@@ arily to V@@ Z@@ SK , the enterprise transferred all social assets , has no debt to the budget and pays salaries on time .
E@@ Z@@ SK 's fixed cost base has been reduced by 12 @@@ -@@ @ 14 % since 1995 .
the cyclical Western European poly@@ but@@ adi@@ ene market , on which E@@ Z@@ SK 's performance is very dependent , decreased 15 % in 1996 .
E@@ Z@@ SK could not maintain its position .
in 1996 , exports to Western Europe decreased by 30 % .
this is mainly due to the increase of energy price , and the effects of the rouble corridor that weakened E@@ Z@@ SK 's competitive position in the export market .
nevertheless , during this same period , E@@ Z@@ SK auto @@@ -@@ @ financed a $ 2.8 million investment to diversify its production and reduce dependence towards the tyre industry .
E@@ Z@@ SK upgraded its production facilities to produce western standard quality high and low molecular poly@@ iso@@ bu@@ ty@@ len@@ e .
this product is used in construction and isolation mater@@ i ­ als .
as a result , the overall export figure for E@@ Z@@ SK in 1997 is due to increase up to 7@@ 2,000 tons ( 1995 : 8@@ 1,000 tons ; 1996 : 5@@ 2,000 tons ) .
and the most significant results is the investment by EBRD .
this process has been initiated by the consultants working with E@@ fre@@ mov in 1994 @@@ -@@ @ 95 .

the L@@ utsk tap@@ ered roller bearing plant was founded in 1981 .
its clients were located all over the Union : Russia , Belarus and Ukraine .
L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant ( L@@ BP ) was the youngest company of this sector in the USSR and the major bearings factory in Ukraine .
since 1994 the enterprise had been transformed into an open Joint @@@ -@@ @ Stock company .
in 1995 , the general meeting of shareholders had decided to make a second issue of shares , which was subscri@@ bed for only by a Swiss bank .
the diagnosis by the consultants
this had resulted in a severe drop in sales of L@@ BP in the former Soviet Repub@@ lics .
nevertheless , the decline in sales In other NIS countries stopped from 1994 • the export market ( outside the former USSR ) was promising in terms of sales .
notably thanks to an agreement with a Slovak producer , L@@ BP had started developing sales on this segment • this market picture has to be completed by the spare parts market .
this market had a good potential , but to address it L@@ BP needed to organise its network and to be able to develop a large number of product references .
consultants noticed that the factory had very little knowledge of its costs , especially in a period when a 30 % use of the production capacities resulted in a very high level of fixed costs .
these segments of the market had also varied characteristics in this respect : • in the consultants ' analysis , the export sales did not allow to cover the company 's over@@ heads in a full cost calculation .
• NIS market remains the most relevant for the company within the middle @@@ -@@ @ term period
• vehicle producer in NIS re@@ oriented to the light vehicles production which used more small diameter bearings
• foreign market Is the only source of real cash flow for the company
• commercial structure is not customer @@@ -@@ @ oriented and market @@@ -@@ @ drawn .
the marketing department had been just established and had no input on enterprise commercial function at all .
the production had been completed by automatic lines for forging , modern machine tools and robots for inner and outer races , and thermal treatment equipment .
50 % of the equipment had come from Germany , the rest from Ukraine , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Russia .
depreciation rate was about 50 % .
the actual production in 1995 consisted of 2.@@ 26 million tap@@ ered roller bearings and 1.@@ 13 million needle car@@ dan bearings represents 24 % of the theoretical capacity of the plant and 40 % of the real capacity .
this made the competitive position of L@@ utsk even weaker .
in order to become a major supplier of the main NIS automotive producers , the plant needed to Incre@@ ase Its offer .
in order to achieve this objective , It had to be considered that about 70 % of technological equipment could be characterised by a lack In flexibility .
the quantity of defects , due to quality problems , was higher than in western competitors factories .
the experts believed that a 20 % reduction of cost prices could be obtained through investment in these areas .
finance
there was no real cash flow because 65 % of sales have been a bar@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ based sales .
the lack of cash In the company made it difficult to pay the salaries ( up to 5 months delay ) and the taxes .
it was all the more difficult to launch new productions , requiring the purchase of raw materials .
quality control systems were restricted to the production sphere : there were no indic@@ a ­ tors , no tools for motivation for the commercial and administrative staff .
in addition , the company offered a full set of auxiliary services , delivered by 300 employ ­ E@@ ES to the workers .
they are a can@@ teen , a recreation centre , an hospital , a greenhouse , a farm , etc .
but some social assets had already been or were going to be transferred to external authorities ( L@@ utsk city for instance ) such as kindergarten or a hostel .
but it was clear that employment would have to be reduced further .
this issue had raised the attention of workers and of the local opinion , L@@ BP being the main employer of the region .
besides the traditional company trade union , L@@ utsk bearing Plant workers had formed another independent Union very active to protect employment and rights .
the company involved in the project its top management and decisions were taken rather rapidly .
B ) Actions
• Streng@@ th@@ ening the marketing team
this department was initially heavily staffed ( 40 ) , and no clear organisation to approach markets and clients .
a new commercial director was nominated and implemented an organisation by target client groups .
this allowed progressively the marketing and sales aspect to become the power Centre of the company .
the department started building a comprehensive client @@@ -@@ @ supplier relationship with its key clients .
in order to achieve better sales in particular on the spare parts business , L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant created a network of dealers in Russia and Ukraine .
case n ° 2 : L@@ utsk bearing plant continuing bar@@ ter activity and increase the share on NIS market , though improving the quality of the bar@@ ter contracts and final cash collection .
• Research of direct clients
previously , all export had been done through a Slovak company .
L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant and this company together were able to propose a full range of production to their clients .
in order to Incre@@ ase margins on export markets , the consultants advised to seek direct con ­ t@@ acts with final customers , and started to take contacts together with the commercial team .
orders for small quantities were obtained and fulfilled .
in order to export directly , It was also necessary to design a new packaging and a catalogue in several languages .

after restructuring Production workshop of rough shaped rol@@ lers after restructuring
finance
like in many restructuring projects , money was necessary to effectively restructure the company .
in particular , developing each model of bearings required around US $ 100,000 in materials purchases .
the simplification of the company structure and defe@@ as@@ ance from auxiliary assets was continued under recommendations of the consultants .
the cooperative , which produces the needle bearings ( a totally different activity ) , the farms , etc. were transformed into sub ­ si@@ di@@ aries and profit centers managed autonom@@ ously .
the social issue was treated with much care .
therefore the departure of 600 to 800 non @@@ -@@ @ operational staff ( administrative staff , employ ­ E@@ ES , workers ) took place in a rather good social atmosphere .
being shareholders of the company , the workers were also informed of the discussions with foreign partners .
situation of the company after 6 months
the main positive point for the company in an increase in sales , after several years of decrease .
for the first seven months of 1997 L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant has produced for Gr@@ y@@ v@@ nas 13@@ ,@@ 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ( $ 7,@@ 39@@ 8,@@ 300 ) .
it showed a growth for 4@@ 5.3 % from the production level of the same period of previous year .
potential partners will be Inter@@ ested In a partnership with L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant not so much to get lower costs for their own markets , but to have access to other markets .
restructuring provo@@ kes decisions which may go against trad@@ i ­ tional behavi@@ ours : the new plant project was abandoned because the market would never reach the levels expected 10 years before .
the equipment which had been pur ­ ch@@ ased was used in order to increase the efficiency and quality level of the existing lines .
moreover , L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant modified its strategy towards potential partners .
it under ­ stood that the world market was under the influence of few companies , and that an agreement with one of them would secure a presence .
the company developed an arg@@ umentation , putting forward the fact that it could help western producer to enter the NIS market .
therefore It is today in a stronger negotiating position and can hope to secure sufficient production level In a long @@@ -@@ @ term agreement .
the textile company Gav@@ r@@ ilov Yam@@ skiy Lin@@ ok@@ om@@ bin@@ at was established in 1872 in Gav@@ r@@ ilov , a small town of Yaros@@ lav region , to manufacture linen yar@@ n and fabric mainly for the Russian market .

the quality of the production was ME@@ DI ­ um , considering the requirements of the internal market , but low regarding the ex@@ ig@@ en ­ C@@ ies of the international market .
when Gav@@ r@@ ilov Yam@@ skiy Lin@@ ok@@ om@@ bin@@ at was privati@@ sed in 1993 , more than 3,@@ 500 employ ­ E@@ ES were working with the company .
when restructuring started , at the beginning of 1996 the workforce was only 2,@@ 400 .
the workers actually control 76 % of the shares of the company .

consequently a long term development strategy for the company has been defined as " became the Russian leading manufacturer for linen and compete effectively on the international market . "
restructuring assistance process
37 b ) Actions taken
to Impl@@ ement this restructuring process , the following actions have been taken :
- decreasing of waste production - decreasing variations to obtain a more regular count - introduction of simple quality control tools - improvement of maintenance and maintenance planning - development of new fabrics more appealing to consumers
the increased export share has generated an extremely positive cash @@@ -@@ @ flow to the com ­ p@@ any that achieved the target to lower bar@@ ter weight .
furthermore the quality control tools and methodologies introduced have guaranteed significant production efficiency Im@@ pro@@ vements to the company : only considering the spinning phase , the efficiency Im@@ pro@@ vement amounts to 10 % .

transformation of tubes , ventilation and safety doors for the housing construction sector
the open joint stock company K@@ SE@@ P was founded in July 1994 after split @@@ -@@ @ off from K@@ CC .
its products are not sold to the public but are ready for installation in new construction , to this extent it is positioned in the middle of the bus@@ i ­ ness stream .
the company had three main production lines : • assembling of tubes and elements for house construction plum@@ bing ( pressure , S@@ ani ­ T@@ ary and heating systems ) .
manufacturing of fit@@ tings and special parts for plum@@ bing • ventilation hardware ( tubes and shun@@ ts ) and heating devices ( boilers , tubes , inter@@ cool@@ ers , and conv@@ ectors ) • safety doors .
the company produced other metal hardware as a complement to the core bus@@ i ­ ness , for example rail@@ ings , iron bars , agricultural tools and also other products under special orders .
the main supplies for the production ( Iron tubes , valves , cast iron items ) are purchased in Ukraine .
the production had dramatically decreased in past years .
short @@@ -@@ @ time factory lock@@ outs and stops of production due to lack of orders were usual In the period of the study .
diagnosis by the consultants
the construction sector in Kiev had a tendency to decline as a result of the overall and deep economic crisis .
a slight increase was expected for 1996 mainly as a result of private initiative .
according to the Statistics Ministry , total housing construction in Ukraine in 1995 was less than half what it was in 1989 .
case n ° 4 : Kiev sanitary engineering plant
• the private enterprises held the rest ( 20 % - 30 % ) , with a significant domination of joint venture companies .
the weight of this sector was probably underestimated due to non declared private construction .
but no real economic , commercial or technical barriers existed to prevent potential new competitors from enter ­ ing the market .
the growth In demand of is@@ o ­ l@@ ating and energy saving materials , related to the customers ' needs for better comfort and quality , creates new potential opportunities for business activities of K@@ SE@@ P .
nearly 85 % of the output Is directed to the housing construction sector in Kiev .
in 1995 , K@@ SE@@ P sales amounted to 50 % of the level of 1992 , the year when the central planning had lost Its significance .
to provide compensation for this drop in sales , the company Intro@@ duc@@ ed a new production line : safety doors .
this new activity only account ­ ed for 4.7 % of the 1995 sales .
this initiative was positive but not sufficient to secure K@@ SE@@ P place of the Kiev construction market .
K@@ SE@@ P is now in competition with five other companies that supply assembled comp@@ o ­ n@@ ents of plum@@ bing , heating and ventilation systems for industrial , agricultural and housing construction .
the financial situation of the company reflected the difficulty of working with a single client : • the level of stocks remained high and imp@@ acted on the cash management of the enterprise .
the 1995 cash flow enabled the enterprise to forecast productive self financed invest ­ ments .
case n ° 4 : Kiev sanitary engineering plant
the first issue to be solved was a staff issue .
the company had no money to hire outside specialists trained in marketing , who in addition would have had to learn everything about K@@ SE@@ P market characteristics .
hence the consultants started selecting staff inside the company in order to constitute a marketing and sales department .
an organisation chart was designed , as well as specific re@@ tribution incentive schemes for the sales people .

the management information system was pro@@ G@@ res ­ sively set @@@ -@@ @ up by the company , based on seminars organised by the consultants .
this better understanding of management techniques made the decision on a new organisation chart more fruitful .

wood industry Ukraine Manufac@@ turing of furniture March 1996 @@@ -@@ @ July 1997
the Car@@ pat@@ y Lviv Fur@@ niture Factory was founded in 1962 as a State enterprise .
in 1993 the company was privati@@ sed and transformed into a Joint Stock Company .
employees and former employees now own 100 % of the shares .
most equipment is equivalent to what could be found in similar western companies .
however , each machine tool is specially designed for the manufacture of one particular part , and C@@ AN@@ NOT be adjusted to manufacture of a different one .
sales were made to furniture stores by a small number of sales@@ men , and directly to the public at a company shop .
sales are made mostly within Ukraine .
there used to be exports to Russia , but such exports , apart from all market conditions and competitive position , have been stopped by a combination of Russian protectionist measures and Ukrainian administrative stubbor@@ n@@ ness .
the Ukrainian furniture Industry has been particularly hit by the fall In the purchasing power of the population : furniture is one of the purchases which can be most easily post ­ p@@ oned .
foreign competition , especially in western Ukraine , where people would just cross the border into Poland , has also been an adverse factor .
for the lower end of the market , which is where Car@@ pat@@ y stands , the market is more reduced for eco ­ nom@@ ical reasons .
the staff decrease from some 2,000 at the beginning of the 1995 to some 650 at the end of the project .
the decrease in employment Is likely to continue , even if the sales pick up .
comparable units in Western Europe would not employ more than 150 people .
the sales had steadily declined over the last 3 years and , when the consultants arrived , the company was technically bankrupt .
diagnosis by the consultant
market and sales ► Quality of the production
when the consultants first visited the company , the quality of the production was app@@ all@@ ingly poor , even by Ukrainian standards .
the ven@@ eer was d@@ ented , torn away at the edges , the var@@ nish turned white rapidly , there were patches of different colours indicating
case n ° 5 : Car@@ pat@@ y L@@ V@@ IV furniture factory
47 repair jobs , production batch marks were clearly visible on the finished product , etc .
when the consultants arrived , there was absolutely no sales / marketing department , let alone any awareness that this was a problem .
smaller , cheaper and mo@@ d ­ ular products were needed .
production costs were high , which reflected of course on the possibility to sell at a com ­ peti@@ tive price .
among the main reasons were :
as the company did not have the cash to buy its raw material , it had to resort to bar@@ ter .
this , in turn , limited its sources of supplies to a few Ukrainian factories willing to accept this method of payment .
the result was that this raw material was markedly more exp@@ en ­ sive than the comparable product which could have been bought for cash , and also of a lower quality .
the process may have been adapted to those conditions , but induc@@ es high costs now that energy is expensive .
case n ° 5 : Car@@ pat@@ y L@@ V@@ IV furniture factory
• some inadequate machines
needless to say , their cost efficiency when operated at a lower capacity was extremely low .
for example , the production of the draw@@ ers In@@ vol@@ ved many more operations than similar productions in western factories , with no improvement in the quality of the final product .
as most former Soviet factories , all decision making was heavily centr@@ alised , and there was a high premium given to technical skills .
the approach to the recruitment of marketing personal was based much more on a knowledge of the pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion processes than on marketing skills and sales@@ manship .
at all levels , knowledge of the production technology was over@@ emphasi@@ sed .
the management , however , did not consider the slump ¡ n sales as a durable trend , and did not take measures to cut or re @@@ -@@ @ assign production .
by the end of 1995 , the Invent@@ ories , instead of being a reservoir of future cash and a hedge against inflation , had become a financial burden for the com ­ p@@ any .
for all practical purposes , the enterprise became a bankrupt in 1995 .
the State , as the main creditor , resorted to blocking the bank accounts , thus accelerating the financial demise of the company .
the company tried to solve this problem by resorting more and more to bar@@ ter , which by@@ passed the bank account but involved higher production costs .
moreover , the financial crisis was deemed to be a temporary one , and the deeper
case n ° 5 : Car@@ pat@@ y L@@ V@@ IV furniture factory
inefficient accounting and cost accounting systems
the situation was also complicated by the fact that the company was 100 % owned by its employees and former employees .
the management was quite reluctant to propose restructuring measures which would be most unpopular with the employees @@@ -@@ @ share@@ hold ­ ers .
the management was aware of the poor quality of the products , but realised that , because of low salaries and forced holidays , it had leverage over the workers .
the first step was to convince the workers of the need to improve the quality .
improvement did come fast in the product quality .
the consultants In@@ tended to implement more quality management processes through quality circles , group discussions on quality , etc .
practical changes have also been im@@ ple ­ m@@ ented , either in the production process or in the storage conditions .
this was basic to the survival of the company .
it proved also extremely difficult , as the management insisted on finding the resources within the company .
case n ° 5 : Car@@ pat@@ y L@@ V@@ IV furniture factory
the manager , a high level techn@@ ician who headed the design department , now has full responsibility for the sales .
the new marketing manager , and some of the new staff , have also been involved In the discussions with the marketing experts of the project .
this should enable them to take into account not only the local mentality , but also the experience of the western experts .
introducing new products / designs
a totally new product range has been introduced , and one of the products was awarded a design award at the Kiev furniture exhibition .
the purpose of this range is both to com ­ Pet@@ e in design and price with foreign or local products , and to reduce production costs through a better ration@@ alisation of the design and the production processes .
the new products are modular , enabling the clients , who now have less buying power than before , to buy only what they can afford .
as mentioned above , the new product line also takes In@@ to account the need to ration@@ alise the basic components of the whole product range .
all this should result in a significant drop in the cost of the finished products , enabling the company to be more competitive .
diminishing the working capital
by the end of 1995 , the recei@@ vable had grown unexpectedly fast , but were still within 1 -@@ 2 months of sales and remained in that range .
stricter credit control methods were Intro@@ duc@@ ed , a drive to recover recei@@ vable was launched , shipments in large quantities were dis@@ continued , which helped stabil@@ ise the situation .
attempts to obtain immediate cash against discounts , as mentioned above , failed .
on the whole , the rise in the accounts recei@@ vable has been stopped , and they now stay at a reasonable level .
even more dangerous , however , was the production planning process based not on the expected sales , but on the need to keep the workforce busy .
case n ° 5 : Car@@ pat@@ y L@@ V@@ IV furniture factory
it is only recently that the production was set closer to the sales level .
a greater flexibility has been established .
this is being translated In the organisational structure of the company , with branch directors taking full responsibility for their sector .
this should normally result in a transformation of those production department into sub ­ si@@ di@@ aries , reinforcing the independence of their managers .
changing the accounting procedures
the cost accounting system was totally irrelevant for managing the company .
this was done in particular by literally dis@@ sec@@ ting the accounting and the cost accounting systems to show their flaws .
in particular , the cost accounting system has to be totally redesigned .
there is no way to assess , today , the actual profitability of a product line or of a marginal production .
however , no real change , short of a costly double set of accounts , can be taken while there is no real accounting reform in Ukraine .
case n ° 5 : Car@@ pat@@ y L@@ V@@ IV furniture factory
more generally , the company is now recovering , after some deep changes , albeit at a reduced capacity , while most of the competing firms which do not have a foreign partner are now idle .
taking into account the depth of the changes this represents , the implementation of all those changes Is slower than it would be the case in a similar western European enterprise .
the structures are now in place to foster the recovery .
outside financial assistance will be necessary .
however , the company now has all the weapons that may be necessary to look for a partnership , industrial or financial .

pharmaceutical industry Russia Gener@@ ic drugs October 1996 - January 1997
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in , a pharmaceutical company located 36 kilometres from Moscow in the village of Star@@ aya K@@ up@@ av@@ na , was founded In 1936 .
prior to 1991 , the company was the USSR 's largest producer of active substances , with annual deliveries of more than 7,000 tons to 44 Soviet pharmaceutical producers and exports to 20 foreign countries .
the economic consequences of the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the Soviet Union had catastrophic con ­ sequences for Soviet pharmaceutical producers , and Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in In particular .
the financial situation was exacerbated by the collapse of government orders and significant depreciation of capital assets .
after initially Intro@@ duc@@ ing 17 ready @@@ -@@ @ form products in 1992 , the company 's production portfolio exceeded 130 drugs by 1996 .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in had converted itself into a producer of generic drugs .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in products include tablets , capsul@@ es and o@@ int@@ ments relating to 24 pharmaceutical groups .
major products include the cardiovascular drugs Cap@@ o@@ ten and Su@@ st@@ ak , central nervous system drug A@@ min@@ al@@ on , the antibiotic Lev@@ om@@ y@@ ce@@ tin and the g@@ astro @@@ -@@ @ intestinal drug V@@ enter .
in 1992 , the company Inst@@ alled the first Good Manufac@@ turing Practice ( G@@ MP ) production line in Russia for production of its hallmark product Cap@@ o@@ ten .
its growth was much slower than the one of its main competitors .

with 180 Stock @@@ -@@ @ Ke@@ eping Un@@ its , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in has the largest product portfolio of any Russian pharmaceuticals manufacturer .
10 drugs accounting for 45 % of 1996 sales . the company 's major product accounted for 17 % of annual sales with revenues growing by 68 % between 1995 and 1996 to $ 6.7 million .
but eight other of the top selling drugs experienced triple @@@ -@@ @ digit growth , and despite its apparent impressive growth , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in was lagging behind .
in 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 1996 , new product introduc@@ tions were the major factor In sales revenue growth of 30 % .
the top eight of 55 drugs introduced in 1996 generated nearly 10 % of sales .
in the second half of 1996 , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in sales fl@@ atten@@ ed out to approximately 20 billion roubles monthly , with profit margins declining to 28 % in November 1996 .
among o@@ int@@ ments , non @@@ -@@ @ branded O@@ TC products were the dominant generators of sales revenues ( 8 % of total 1996 sales ) .
due to relatively small manufacturing expenses , tablets and capsul@@ es yield gross margins of approximately 60 % .
higher manufacturing costs of o@@ int@@ ment products result in gross profitability of 19 % .
80 % of total production costs derived from raw materials , including direct raw materials and packaging .
in independent product profitability calculations , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in allocated over@@ heads to products based on the traditional Russian method of proportion of salaries .
the company has more than 1,500 employees .
over 60 % of employees are in overhead departments , a figure which more than twice exceeds other East European generic producers .
the remaining 38 % of sales were to pharmacies and small random accounts .
sales to smaller Phar@@ mat@@ si@@ y@@ as and pharmacies entail additional financing and transportation costs ( the latter in the case of pharmacies ) which erode profit margins by at least 5 % .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in 's share ( among Russian producers ) in various Russian wholes@@ al@@ ers differs wide ­ ly .
the company only sel@@ ectively sells to a number of leading national and regional whole ­ sal@@ ers , and 55 % of sales revenues derive from Moscow @@@ -@@ @ based clients .
a subsidiary distributor Pri@@ map@@ harm , dedicated exclusively to the sale of Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in products , sells pr@@ i ­ mar@@ ily to small wholes@@ al@@ ers at discount prices .
regional markets differ in attractiveness by parameters of population size , income and disease incidence .
population size does not necessarily correspond to average income or size of the regional economy .
moreover , among Russia 's regions , there is significant discre@@ pancy in disease incidence In various therapeutic areas .
at the same time , 90 % of doctors surveyed consider availability of drugs in pharmacies to be the main factor influencing prescription .
however , the company subsidiary distributor receives discounts of up to 15 % and res@@ ells at price points lower than other Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in clients .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in has less sales manpower on both an absolute basis ( 10 sales employees ) and on a revenues per sales person basis ( $ 4 million / sales employee ) than Eastern European analogue generic companies .
in addition , the company had no understanding of its cost situation , no clear view of which product was profitable , and which one was not profitable .
the company established a joint working group with the consultants to address priority areas for development and established the following strategy :
• Company sales functions must be expanded and strategically targeted
the company must increase its number of sales representatives , expanding its coverage of regional distributors , pharmacies and doctors .
sales staff should be based in priority regions , defined by relevant parameters of relative attractiveness .
an effective salary incentive system should be introduced to boost sales force efficiency .
the sales force must initially target the retail and wholesale channels .
the company must actively identify and focus on key national distributors .
• Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in must review product profitability based on more advanced manag@@ eri ­ al accounting techniques
the traditional method of overhead allocation based on proportion of salaries ske@@ ws profitability measurement .
new product introduction has to be the key driver in Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in sales gains .
inflated manpower and inefficient labour productivity especially In indirect areas inherited from the company 's past as a producer of chemical substances may be significant co@@ st@@ cutting opportunities .
the company needs to identify areas for restructuring , and to cut staff@@ ing of overhead departments .
actions taken a ) Establis@@ h@@ ment of a field sales force
the Sales Division was created at the company based on the consultants ' recomm@@ enda ­ tions , with the new sales function and the order taking / logistics function organised as two separate units .
in 1997 , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in prioriti@@ sed the recruitment of 15 field sales representatives to work in regions identified as strategically attractive , where the company 's distributors were not present .
by mid@@ year , the company had 10 regional sales representatives located In St. Petersburg , Ori@@ ol , Novgorod , Tyumen , Irkutsk , Ek@@ aterinburg , Rostov @@@ -@@ @ on @@@ -@@ @ Don , Krasnoyarsk , Saratov and Ch@@ eli@@ ab@@ insk .
in September , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in anticipated hiring an add@@ i ­ tional 5 sales representatives to cover the Ufa , Nov@@ ok@@ uz@@ net@@ sk , Perm , Khabarovsk and other regions .
the new sales representatives were allocated to macro @@@ -@@ @ regional centres , from where they co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ate company sales activities In surrounding Ob@@ lasts .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in is currently developing advertising materials for both doctors and point @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ sale at local pharmacies .
eventually , the company plans to split sales force efforts equally between wholes@@ al@@ ers vs. doctors and pharmacies .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in designed a standard contract for field sales representatives , with compensation consisting of a base salary and variable commission .
the commission portion directly relates to company sales levels in the relevant region .

poly@@ clinics and doctors approached on strictly selective basis b ) Focus on top distributors
management identified 20 @@@ -@@ @ 25 top national and regional distributors which had made payments on @@@ -@@ @ time and were increasing sales revenues .
this group receives higher dis ­ counts and better credit terms than other customers .
in September , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in was con ­ si@@ dering supplying products on con@@ signment to leading regional wholes@@ al@@ ers In exchange for the counterpart 's obligation to fulfil local marketing and merchan@@ dis@@ ing functions .
the management of effective working relationships at national and regional levels is signi@@ fi ­ can@@ tly strengthening Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in 's position in the market and will contribute to a significant sales expansion .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in introduced an " o@@ int@@ ment policy " with the top distributors due to high competition from a key competitor , and low sales volumes .
typically , if Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in lowers product sales prices by 10 @@@ -@@ @ 20 % , distributors are willing to purchase 23 times greater physical volume .
this allows the company to increase total contribution margin and capacity utilis@@ ation , critical factors in the o@@ int@@ ments division .
the results are higher overall profitability in this product group and stronger competitive position against a number of key players in this segment .
the company 's high number of items , for its current level of sales creates complications in packaging , substance procurement and ware@@ housing .
the company is targeting pro@@ d ­ uc@@ ts with negative or very low contribution margin for elimination and replacement with more profitable , newer drugs during 1997 @@@ -@@ @ 1998 .
overall , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in has targeted to reduce the number of Stock @@@ -@@ @ Ke@@ eping Un@@ its eventually to 100 .
D ) New product introduction capability
with the simplest source of new drugs ( existing technology ) exhausted , the company is currently working together with two Russian institutes on the development of 14 new drugs .
En@@ al@@ pril , considered the future top selling drug , is in the process of development .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in is building internal technological and human capabilities , and is hiring qualified personnel .
the company has purchased equipment for formulation development and pilot production .
the project provided the company with a detailed database on patent expiry and information on market potential for such products .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in created a Marketing Department .
the company hired a specialist to supervise analysis of new product potential .
the company has significantly increased Its use of information sources and strategic analysis in marketing decisions .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in introduced a more systematic process of id@@ ent@@ i ­ fying product introduction opportunities .
moreover , it increasingly uses local sources of information on prices , distributors and sales .
after joint work with Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in , the distributor Pro@@ tek provides information on regional sales split by product .
F ) Cost reduction
the company plans to reduce centr@@ alised maintenance by leaving only " emergency service " on the central level , while leaving maintenance on the workshop level .
this will strengthen its cost position against eastern European which have significant productivity advantages over Russian producers .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in has planned to dispose of unnecessary assets , including a pumping station that serves the village and buses used once a year for special events .
management is also considering transferring an antiqu@@ ated heating station and kindergarten to the municipal ­ ity .
this measure would greatly enhance the attractiveness of the company to potential Invest@@ ors .

the EU and Russia : ever Clo@@ ser Partners in a Wi@@ der Europe
" we want to help fully integrate Russia into our community of values .
we want to identify the mo@@ st@@ appropriate means of cooperation , not only on the economy , the environment and energy but also on@@ defence , security and safeguarding democratic rights . " ( European Commission President Rom@@ ano Pro@@ di , 2002 )
the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - cornerstone of bilateral relations
the cornerstone of EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PC@@ A ) , which@@ defines the EU and Russia as strategic partners .
it was signed in June 1994 in Cor@@ fu by the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the EU , the President of the European Commission and@@ the President of the Russian Federation .
it entered into force on 1 December 1997 .
the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is based on@@ core principles shared by both parties , ranging from the promotion of international peace and security to the sup@@ port@@ for a democratic society based upon political and econom@@ ic@@ freedoms .
it creates a spirit of equality and partner@@ shi@@ pa@@ im@@ ed at strengthening political , commercial , economic and@@ cultural ties , and sets the agenda for negotiations on an@@ eventual free trade area .
the Agreement launched a new@@ political dialogue between the partners .
the PC@@ A established an institutional framework for dialogue between the European Union and Russia .
since the PC@@ A came into force , the two sides have held Sum@@ mits twice a year .
the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement contains 112 articles , 10 annex@@ es , 2 protocols , and an@@ umber of declarations .
. . . complemented by Russia 's Strategy towards the European Union up to 2010
in October 1999 , Russia demonstrated the key importance of its relationship with the European Uni@@ on@@ by adopting its own Strategy towards the European Union , covering the period until 2010 .
a new level of political and security cooperation
constant political dialogue takes place at all levels of EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations , from the Summit me@@ et@@ ing@@ s@@ between Heads of State to meetings of senior diplomats .
stressing their joint understandings , the EU and Russia have adopted a number of joint declar@@ ation@@ son issues dealt with under the political dialogue .
the political dialogue also provides an opportunity to openly discuss questions on which appro@@ ach@@ es@@ may diver@@ ge , such as the Chechen conflict .

Russia will soon be contributing to the first ES@@ DP @@@ -@@ @ led operation , the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which became operational on 1 January 2003 .
discussions are also underway to expl@@ ore@@ prospects for Russia 's possible contribution of capabilities , particularly strategic air@@ lift , to future ES@@ DP operations .
Russia and the enlar@@ ging EU : close partners in a Wi@@ der Europe
" with globalisation and the creation of a trans @@@ -@@ @ national civil society , the Union 's external relation@@ scan no longer be distinguished from its internal development , particularly when it comes to our neighbourhood .
the EU hopes that Russia will show interest in working in partnership with the Union to implement@@ the new approach , which intends to complement and reinforce the EU 's commitment to an ever @@@ -@@ @ closer EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia partnership .
European Union -
EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia economic relations are increasingly important for both sides .
in turn , Russi@@ a@@ has immense resources and a qualified labour force .
furthermore , Russia 's energy supplies to the EU@@ can help to enhance Europe 's energy security .
the EU fav@@ ours the integration of a prosperous Russi@@ ain@@ to the global economic system and , in particular , Russia 's accession to the World Trade Organization .
since 1997 , EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia economic relations have been governed by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PC@@ A ) .
PC@@ A implementation is the key@@ stone for developing the relationship between the EU and Russia .
the far @@@ -@@ @ reaching liber@@ al@@ ising thrust of the PC@@ A , envis@@ aging the eventual setting up of@@ a free trade area , reflects the mutual importance of relations between the two economies .
the EU and Russia are currently working together to fin@@ alise an efficient dispute settlement mechan@@ is@@ m@@ under the PC@@ A .
since the emergence of an economy reflecting market forces in Russia , trade flows have been grow@@ ing@@ consistently .
bilateral trade dropped following the 1998 Rou@@ ble crisis , but it has picked up again substantially over the years 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2002 with the recovery of the Russian economy .
European Union -
the recover@@ y@@ of the Russian economy since 2000 has attracted growing imports from the EU , which are@@ now running at levels exceeding trade be@@ fore@@ 1998 .
Russia 's accession to the World Trade Organization ( WTO )
" accession to the WTO would constitute a major political achievement for Russia .
it would be a clear@@ signal that old @@@ -@@ @ style state micro @@@ -@@ @ management of the economy has gone for good . it would cement Russia 's growing profile in the international economy .
I am convinced that WTO accession will be to@@ the mutual benefit of Russia , the European Union and the multilateral , rules @@@ -@@ @ based trading system .
the EU strongly supports Russia 's efforts to join the WTO on commercially viable terms .
in particular , within the WTO the EU played a key role in the drawing up of the Working Party Report on Russia 's accession , hence accelerating the accession process .
it should be noted th@@ at@@ anti @@@ -@@ @ dumping is not a major aspect in EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia trade at present .
only 11 anti @@@ -@@ @ dumping measures are in force concerning Russian products , representing 1.5 percent of bilateral trade .
terms of reference were agreed at the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Sum@@ miti@@ n October of that year .
the High @@@ -@@ @ Level Group will present its final report in 2003 .
the next EU enlargement opens new challenges and opportunities for Russia 's economy .
Russia is well@@ positioned to take advantage of the EU enlargement , given its geographical proximity to the expanding markets .
the majority of acc@@ eding countries are traditional economic partners of Russia , including in the trade field .
this opportunity should lead to an increase in Russia 's welfare .
European Union -
by the end of 2002 , the share of the euro had doubled and accounted for 20 % of the@@ total gold and forex reserves .
Russian citizens are increasingly looking at the euro as a stable and reliable currency in which they can store the value of their savings .
EU investors can play a key role in providing capital and technology .
European Union -
currently , companies from the EU countries are the maj@@ or@@ foreign investors in Russia .
however , the level of su@@ ch@@ investments is well below what Russia could absorb to modern@@ ise its economy .
the European Union is committed to helping Russia in carrying out its economic reform process , notably by providing financial and technical support through the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
European Union -
T@@ AC@@ IS is a technical assistance programme of the EU launched in 1991 for 12 republics of the former Soviet Union ( excluding the Baltic countries ) , and Mongolia .
Russia - the biggest beneficiary of T@@ ac@@ is
Russia is the Programme 's biggest beneficiary , receiving about half of all funding .
since the laun@@ ch@@ of the Programme in 1991 , Russia has been allocated a total of € 2,@@ 6@@ 60 million in T@@ ac@@ is assistance .
civil society is further@@ ed through institutional partnerships .
this area of cooperation is expected to receive at@@ ot@@ al of around € 15.@@ 5 million in 2003 .
3.@@ Support in addressing the social consequences of transition -@@ Actions in this area will focus on tw@@ op@@ ri@@ orities : support to social reform and support to municipal services .
the objectives are to mitigate the social costs of restructuring the economy , to reduce social disparities , and to improve the@@ delivery of primary municipal services .
a total budget of around € 24 million is allocated to th@@ is@@ area in 2003 .
an indicative budget of@@ around € 43 million has been allocated to this sector for 2003 .
Russia receives additional support through T@@ ac@@ is multi @@@ -@@ @ country@@ programmes , including the Regional Programme and the Cross @@@ -@@ @ Border Cooperation Programme , for projects in fields such as@@ environment , telecommunications and Information Society networks , managing migration and fighting crime .
it also participates in a number of programmes supporting small @@@ -@@ @ scale projects , such as training , policy advice , institution building and investment support .
many T@@ ac@@ is @@@ -@@ @ supported activities are in fields that are not restricted within national borders , and are@@ thus more appropriately implemented in programmes covering several or all T@@ ac@@ is partner countries .
the T@@ ac@@ is Regional Programme addresses three separate areas , all of which concern Russia :
another multi @@@ -@@ @ country programme is the T@@ ac@@ is Cross @@@ -@@ @ Border Cooperation Programme , which supports actions on the borders between Russia , Belarus , Moldova and Ukraine and the EU .
its aim is to@@ promote cooperation on specific issues , such as the environment and migration , between commun@@ iti@@ es@@ on both sides of a common border .
nuclear safety is also the subject of a T@@ ac@@ is multi @@@ -@@ @ country programme , addressing the common problems of all the partner countries with nuclear installations on their territory .
small projects programmes
T@@ AC@@ IS also supports targeted smaller scale projects in Russia .
projects under these programmes tend@@ to have budgets of € 100,000 to € 6@@ 00,000 , in comparison with projects funded under the national or@@ multi @@@ -@@ @ country programmes , which have a minimum budget of € 2 million .
a total of six such programmes are being implemented , falling into three groups :
on the whole , Russia receives annually approximately € 200 million through T@@ ac@@ is .
European Union -
table - T@@ ac@@ is funds allocated to Russia annually
the implementation of the T@@ ac@@ is Programme is underpinned by continuous dialogue with the partner@@ countries .
first , at the political level , the European Commission analyses the current and expected situation in Russia in consultation with the Russian authorities .
it examines the EU 's relationship with the country and , on this basis , sets out priorities for T@@ ac@@ is support in a Country Strategy Paper .
on the basis of this strategy , the European Commission , in consultation with the Russian authorities , sets out the financial resources that can be allocated to address the priority objectives in great@@ er@@ detail , identifying potential partner institutions and setting objectives .
this forms the National Indic@@ ative Programme ( N@@ IP ) , which covers a period up to four years .
the Russian Government tak@@ es@@ an active part in the process and formally approves each N@@ IP before its implementation .
the next step is to move from the objectives of the Indic@@ ative Programme to a set of specific , detail@@ ed@@ projects matching those objectives .
the European Commission adopts annual Action Program@@ mess@@ et @@@ -@@ @ ting out those projects which are agreed with the Russian Government .
once projects are ready to be@@ implemented , contractors are selected by the European Commission to undertake the project following competitive ten@@ dering .
in a typical T@@ ac@@ is project , a team of experts drawn from EU countries ( or future EU Member States ) works with the staff of a Russian partner organisation .
the establishment of pil@@ ot@@ projects in particular regions or institutions is often used as ame@@ ans of proving a methodology before encouraging others to@@ take it up .
besides training and knowledge transfer , essential supplies for the implementation of a T@@ ac@@ is proj@@ ec@@ t@@ can be purchased .
support is also given for investment and investment support activities .
in this context , T@@ ac@@ is will provide a total of € 24 million to finance the construction of a sl@@ udge inc@@ iner@@ ator Plan@@ tin St Petersburg in 2003 .
how to work with T@@ ac@@ is
T@@ AC@@ IS projects are carried out by con@@ sor@@ tia representing associations or organisations from different EU or Central European countries selected by the European Commission on the basis of a competi@@ tiv@@ et@@ ender .
the selected contractor works with a pre @@@ -@@ @ defined beneficiary organisation in Russia to implement the project .
tenders are published in the Official Journal of the European Commun@@ ities .
Russian governmental organisations , NGOs and other institutions may make suggestions for fut@@ ure@@ projects either to the relevant authorities in their own country or to the Delegation of the European Commission in Russia .
how is T@@ ac@@ is different from other assistance programmes ?
T@@ AC@@ IS is not the only assistance programme working with Russia .
however , a combination of sever@@ al@@ features makes T@@ ac@@ is unique .
first , all T@@ ac@@ is activities are the result of continuous dialogue between Russia and the EU , giving both sides a sense of partnership and a strong commitment to the programme .
finally , T@@ ac@@ is assistance is given in the form of grants , not loans , to Russian counter@@ part@@ organisations .

EC Humanitarian Assistance to Russia :
targeting the Vic@@ tim@@ s of the Chechnya Conflict in the Northern Caucasus
the European Union provides humanitarian assistance through its specially created European Commission Humanitarian Office ( EC@@ HO ) .
● EC@@ HO , the Humanitarian Aid Office , is the European Commission service responsible for@@ humanitarian assistance to third countries and one of the world 's biggest humanitarian ai@@ d@@ donors .
since the beginning of the Chechen crisis , EC@@ HO has been the main donor of humanitarian aid in the Northern Caucasus .
when fighting first erupted in Chechnya at the end of 1994 , EC@@ HO was one of the@@ first international donors to respond to the needs of those affected .
the number of Inter@@ nally Dis@@ placed People ( IDPs ) within Chechnya is estimated to be@@ around 150,000 , among a resident population of some 1.1 million ( Census 2002 ) .
according to offici@@ al@@ estimates , slightly more than 6@@ 4,000 Chechen IDPs live in Ingushetia , whose local population is@@ 400,000 .
however , NGOs provide lower figures for the resident population and higher figures for IDPs .
approximately half of these IDPs live in private accommodation ( either with relatives or host@@ families ) , with the remaining half living in tent@@ ed@@ camps and spontaneous settlements .
NGOs estim@@ ate@@ that around 5,000 IDPs live in Dagestan , among are@@ sident population of 2 million .
in 2002 , the European Commission allocated € 28 million@@ through EC@@ HO in support of victims of the Chechnya conflict .
a similar amount has been allocated for 2003 .
European Union -
in 2002 , EC@@ HO began funding the construction of an@@ umber of temporary shelters ( wooden bar@@ racks ) for Chechen IDPs unwilling to return to Chechnya .
echo supports educational and vocational training proj@@ ec@@ ts@@ for children under six , teenagers and@@ young adults .
psych@@ o @@@ -@@ @ social sup@@ por@@ tis also made available in order to help them cope with their displacement and the trauma many of them have suffered .
IDPs needs are monitored and assessed periodically
echo is currently funding the Danish Refugee Council to undertake household economy surveys in@@ several districts of Chechnya .
the aim is to improve the targeting of assistance to the most vulnerable .
difficult working environment
at the time of publication , Ar@@ jan Er@@ kel , Head of Mission of EC@@ HO implementing partner MSF @@@ -@@ @ Switzerland in Dagestan , was still missing .
he was@@ abducted on 12 August 2002 .
his abduction led to@@ the immediate and indefinite suspension of all MSF 's activities in Chechnya and Dagestan .
Nina Davi@@ d@@ ovich , Head of Dru@@ zh@@ ba ( UNICEF partner ) , was abducted in July 2002 and was only released in January 2003 .
EU@@ attempts to achieve more appropriate operating conditions for international implementing partner@@ s@@ have , as yet , not been successful .
EU En@@ larg@@ ement -@@ a Historic Opportun@@ ity
on 1st May 2004 , ten countries are expected to become members of the European Union : Cyprus ; the Czech Republic ; Estonia ; Hungary ; Latvia ; Lithuania ; Malta ; Poland ; the Slovak Republic and Slovenia .
after four successful enlarg@@ ements ( 1973 , 1981 , 1986 , 1995 ) , which increased the EU member@@ ship@@ from six to fifteen members , the European Union is now fin@@ al@@ ising its biggest enlargement ever .
it was officially launched in March 1998 .
at the Copenhagen Summit of December 2002 , the EU@@ decided that the ten aforementioned countries w@@ oul@@ d@@ join as of May 2004 .
Bulgaria and Romania should be@@ able to do so by 2007 .
Turkey is also a candidate country , but the EU has not opened EU accession negotiations as yet .
" our achievement is unique .
this Union represents our will to@@ embark on a new future based on cooperation , respect for diversity and mutual understanding . " ( extract of the " Athens Declaration " of 16 April 2003 )
in the coming years , other countries may be@@ expected to submit applications for EU membership .
Croatia has already put forward its offici@@ al@@ candidacy .
as the current enlargement phase is@@ still not fully completed , it is too early to say@@ when negotiations with other countries may@@ start .
however , what is fundamental to any@@ widening of the EU is that the nature of the EU@@ itself remains coherent and that its achievements in raising standards for its citizens are@@ not compromised .
European Union -
EU enlargement and Russia : political and economic benefits
the EU firmly believes that the forthcoming enlargement will , overall , have very positive effects for Russia .
enlargement is expected to increase political and economic stability in Russia 's direct neighbourhood , contributing to the positive development of relations between Russia and future EU@@ Member States .
furthermore , Russia should anticipate that the specific policy priorities of acc@@ ed@@ ing@@ countries will influence general policies of the EU .
as one example , the EU 's Northern Dimen@@ sion policy , which promotes development and cooperation in the Baltic Sea region , was created under the@@ influence of countries that joined the EU during the last enlargement process , namely Finland and Sweden .
from an economic point of view , EU enlargement opens new challenges and opportunities for Russia '@@ s@@ economy .
the EU is already Russia 's largest trade partner and the bilateral trade volume is expec@@ t@@ ed@@ to increase to over 50 % of Russia 's external trade .
EU enlargement will give Russia direct access to@@ one , larger , harmon@@ ised EU market of some 450 million people .
this means that a Russian product meeting the requirements of the EU market , for example regarding technical requirements for safety , can be sold anywhere on the EU@@ market of 25 countries , from Poland to Portugal .
simplification will benefit particularly Small and Medium @@@ -@@ @ sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) , for which the costs of compliance with trade procedures are proportion@@ ately higher .
recent macroeconomic studies conducted by different research centres have concluded that Russia 's welfare will increase as a result of enlargement .
Russia is well positioned to take advantage of EU enlargement also due to its geographical proxim@@ ity@@ to the several acc@@ eding countries experiencing strong economic growth .
the majority of acc@@ ed@@ ing@@ countries are traditional economic partners of Russia , including in the trade sector .
this situ@@ ation@@ will be reflected in the overall trade relations between the EU and Russia .
European Union -
in view of its geographical position , Kaliningrad is clearly of exceptional importance in the context of@@ the forthcoming enlargement of the EU .
it is the EU 's explicit intention to ensure that borders do not@@ become barriers .
meanwhile , Lithuania and Russia are speeding up efforts to ensure that all legal and practical arrangements are in place to enable the successful implement@@ ation@@ of the FT@@ D / F@@ RT@@ D scheme by 1 July 2003 .
EU provides priority assistance to Kaliningrad oblast
Kaliningrad is part of the Russian Federation and responsibility for its future development lies with@@ the Russian authorities .
however , in view of the present EU enlargement and in the context of its Northern Dimen@@ sion policy for the development and integration of the Baltic region , the European Union has a firm commitment to assisting the development of Kaliningrad oblast .
the European Commission has , therefore , been developing an active assistance programme in the area for more than@@ ten years .
since 1991 , the European Union has made a large financial commitment to Kaliningrad , providing roughly € 40 million directly under various sub @@@ -@@ @ allocations of the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
EU support through the T@@ ac@@ is Programme has focused on a number of key sectors :
● Private Sec@@ tor@@ - In order to support Kaliningrad 's efforts towards the improvement of its business@@ environment and economic development , the EU has focused its assistance on enterprise restructuring , human resource development , promotion of innovative Small and Medium @@@ -@@ @ sized Enterprises , and support for the energy sector .
European Union -
● Health and Educ@@ ation@@ - The EU supports several initiatives at the local level and in the non @@@ -@@ @ gov @@@ -@@ @ ern@@ mental sector to help reform health care delivery systems and to deal with HIV .
the EU has al@@ so@@ supported NGOs in the social sector , focusing in particular on the social re @@@ -@@ @ integration of form@@ er@@ military staff and their families .
under its " T@@ emp@@ us " programme for higher education , the EU h@@ as@@ encouraged cooperation between Kaliningrad and EU universities .
the EU will continue to pay particular attention to Kalin@@ in@@ grad@@ oblast , both in the context of its initiatives in the Baltic Sea region , and with regards to enlargement .
thus , in the future , the oblast will@@ also receive priority funding under the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
in this context , the European Commission , in syner@@ gy with other@@ donors , launched in March 2003 a Special Programme of € 25 mil@@ li@@ onto support the Russian Federal Task Programme ( FTP ) for Kaliningrad .

EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Cooperation on the Environment
the EU and Russia face a range of common global , regional and@@ trans @@@ -@@ @ boundary environmental concerns , such as :
Russia is of extreme importance to Europe 's environment and to@@ the sustainable development of the planet .
over 20 % of glob@@ al@@ fresh water resources , 25 % of forests and 25 % of min@@ er@@ al@@ resources are located within its borders .
it contains vast areas of@@ pri@@ st@@ ine wilderness , virtually un@@ disturbed by human activity .
however , Russia also has considerable environmental problems , especially in industrial and den@@ sel@@ y@@ populated urban areas , which represent about 10 @@@ -@@ @ 15 percent of the country .
municipal water is unreliable in man@@ y@@ cities , creating the threat of water pollution , including severe contamination with heavy metals .
one@@ third of all water pipes and 17 % of sewage pipes urgently need to be replaced .
environmental ac@@ tion@@ is needed to improve public health - diseases and poisoning from heavy metals and other toxic materials are significant in the decline of the life expectancy , which for males is now only 58 years .
Russian oil@@ companies spill approximately 20 million tonnes of@@ oil each year ( 5 % of total extraction ) , leading t@@ osev@@ ere soil contamination .
European Union -
EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia cooperation on the environment is governed by the wide @@@ -@@ @ ranging Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PC@@ A ) that entered into force in 1997 .
dialogue is conducted through the PC@@ A Sub @@@ -@@ @ committee on Environment , Energy and Nuclear Safety .
in 2001 , the European Commission adopted a Communication devoted specifically to EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Environmental Cooperation .
in 2002 , the EU and Russia agreed on a Joint Work Programme to tackle environmental concer@@ n@@ s.@@ Under the programme , the following priorities are envisaged :
EU assistance provided through technical and international financing cooperation
EU assistance to tackle environmental issues is provided mainly through it@@ st@@ echn@@ ical cooperation Programme T@@ ac@@ is .
EU funds allocated for environmental programmes in Russia currently total around € 70 million .
European Union -
the EU and Russia need to work together to implement the Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol .
the Protocol can only enter into force once it has been ratified by the 55 countries responsible for 55 % of the total emissions of developed countries in 1990 .
over 100 countries , representing more than two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the global population , have already rati@@ fi@@ ed@@ the Kyoto Protocol , including the present and future Member States of the European Union .
however , these countries represent " only " 4@@ 3.9 % of the relevant 1990 emissions .
thus , the second criterion to@@ allow the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force still has to be met .
this criterion can only be met if Russi@@ ar@@ ati@@ fies the Kyoto Protocol , as the country accounted for 17.@@ 4 % of the total emissions of develop@@ ed@@ countries in 1990 .
Russia stands to gain from rati@@ fying the Kyoto Protocol .
politically , ratification will underscore Russia 's leadership in addressing issues of global concern and in participating in multilateral international frameworks .
I trust that Russia will@@ live up to its responsibilities and political commitments .
the EU is looking forward to cooperating ev@@ enclo@@ ser with Russia to fight this global challenge . "
environmental benefits and economic and social objectives do coincide
regarding energy production , vast economic and environmental gains could be made from more efficient production and distribution of energy , including the reduction of pipeline leakage , as well as@@ from greater energy conservation .
Russia could reach energy efficiency gains almost equivalent to it@@ s@@ natural gas production .
improved and harmon@@ ised environmental standards would facilitate access of Russian exports to foreign markets .
it would also enhance the climate for foreign investment , because investors want a clear , stable and efficiently enforced regulatory framework so th@@ at@@ they can assess with confidence what their environmental responsibilities are .

Russia has major scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how , but is facing many problems
the European Union recogn@@ ises Russia 's importance in the international scientific and technical community .
in addition to limited investments , the phenomenon of " brain drain , " particularly weak innovation and low salaries for scientists are al@@ so@@ problems for the development of the science and technology sector in Russia .
nevertheless , Russia has excellent know @@@ -@@ @ how in discipl@@ in@@ es@@ such as theoretical physics , plasma physics , mathematics , aviation , nuclear science and some areas of biology .
the approximately 70 Science cities and the so @@@ -@@ @ called Clo@@ sed Cities are also capable of providing important work in the science and@@ technology area .
60 State Research Centres ( Centres of Excell@@ ence ) , based on world leading institutions , were established recently to@@ improve science management .

the bilateral Space Dialogue between the European Union and Russia was launched in 1998 . Bo@@ th@@ sides have a mutual interest in multipl@@ ying the cooperation projects in the area of Space and applied Space technologies , taking into account their social and economic potential .

important prospects for future cooperation , notably on G@@ AL@@ I@@ LE@@ O
European Union -
the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Sum@@ mits held in Brussels in October 2001 and in Moscow in May 2002 established important guidelines for the practical implementation of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia by , amongst other means , stepping up the Energy Dialogue .
the aim of the Dialogue is the development of a long @@@ -@@ @ term Energy Partnership between the EU and Russia within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement .
the Dialogue is focused on oil and natural gas , cooperation in the inter@@ connection of EU and Russi@@ an@@ electricity grids , and trade in nuclear materials .
why the Dialogue ?
53 % of Russia 's oil exports go to the EU , representing 16 % of total EU@@ oil consumption . 62 % of Russia 's natural gas exports arrive in the EU , representing 20 % of total E@@ Un@@ at@@ ural gas consumption .
sustainable development in the Russian energy sector requires investments
for the success of the Energy Dialogue , it is essential to establish the conditions necessary to encourage investment and@@ technology transfer in Russia 's energy sector ( including production , transportation and consumption ) .
of this amount , some € 150 billion will be requi@@ re@@ dup to the year 2010 , 30 % of which is expected to come fro@@ m@@ foreign investment .
Russia needs to increase the predictability and transparency of the business and investment climate in@@ order to attract both EU and domestic investment .
European Union -
the Dialogue in practice

the Dialogue has produced several preliminary results
based on the Dialogue 's explor@@ atory phase , an agreement h@@ as@@ been reached to launch feasibility studies for the infrastructure projects identified as being of common interest , namely :
furthermore , Russian and EU@@ experts have started working on the inter@@ connection of EU and Russian electricity grids .
finally , the Moscow @@@ -@@ @ based EU / Russia Energy Technology Centre was inaugurated in November 2002 , with the aim of enhancing technology transfer .
the Energy Charter Treaty : importance of its ratification
Russia signed the Treaty in 1994 .
it ISA legally binding multilateral instrument dealing specifically with intergovernmental cooperation in@@ the energy sector based on market economy , mutual assistance and non @@@ -@@ @ discrimination .
among the most important issues for the EU is the need for Russia to pursue economic reforms in the@@ energy sector .

cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs
justice and Home Affairs ( J@@ HA ) is a relatively new area for@@ cooperation between the EU and Russia , but its impact is@@ already visible .

at the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Summit of 3 October 2001 , the first Joint Statement on International Terrorism was adopted .
in a second Joint Statement on Terrorism , issued at the Brussels Summit of 11 November 2002 , the EU and Russia re @@@ -@@ @ affirmed their commitment :
... " to strengthen our cooperation to prevent and suppress terrorist acts including by full implementation of the relevant international anti @@@ -@@ @ terrorism conventions and Security Council resolutions , in particular Security Council Resolution 13@@ 73 ( 2001 ) . "
the EU and Russia have also resolved to fin@@ alise an agreement on cooperation in the exchange of technical and strategic information between Euro@@ pol ( the EU law enforcement organisation ) and Russia .

a guide to the export and import@@ of cultural goods between Russia and the European Union
dear friends and art lovers !
we are already beginning to see some concrete manifestations of these aims .
in 2007 the European Commission launched the first call for proposals specifically focused on culture .
we will support initiatives through partnerships among a wide range of local authorities , non @@@ -@@ @ govern @@@ -@@ @ mental organisations , artistic universities and museums from Russia and from the EU Member States .
by doing this , the European Commission aims to boost cooperation in the cultural field and to promote innovative artistic and cultural projects with a European dimension .
an example of the type of initiative that works on this Europe dimension is the Europe - Russia - Europe exhibition that took place from May to July 2007 at the State Tre@@ ty@@ akov Gallery in Moscow .
cultural exchanges have always been important in all of our societies .
the present publication was inspired by the Space on Research , Education and Culture

when you travel abroad do you like to buy art or anti@@ ques ?
perhaps you are involved in organising an international exhibition where you need to transport works of art to another country for a short period ?
or maybe a musician , agent or concert organis@@ er who wants to take musical instruments abroad for a performance ?
are you involved in cultural cooperation projects specifically between Russia and a European Union country ?
if so , you need to know about the procedures and regulations that apply to the import and export of cultural goods between Russia and the EU .
the main focus is on the visual arts , anti@@ ques and musical instruments , as well as other cultural goods that are covered by existing legislation .
the exhibition Europe @@@ -@@ @ Russia @@@ -@@ @ Europe .
state Tre@@ ty@@ akov Gallery , Moscow , May @@@ -@@ @ July 2007
a new programme to support EU Russia cultural cooperation initiatives was launched in 2007 through the Delegation of the European Commission to Russia .
the art trade relies on the movement of art works , anti@@ ques , furniture and other ar@@ te@@ facts across international borders .
introduction still deal with the legal and practical aspects of moving valuable art objects from one country to another .
ever increasing numbers of travellers are drawn to the cities and regions of Europe and Russia .
history shows that foreign visitors have always enjoyed buying valuable cultural objects abroad to take home with them as a reminder of their stay .
it is certainly true that a great deal of present day cultural , political and economic activity relies on the movement of art across international borders .
these included a very famous painting , viewed as a pr@@ iceless piece of Danish cultural history .
the government collected a large amount of money but it was not able to acquire the painting .
most countries have seen repeated revisions and amendments to the cultural heritage protection legislation to bring it into line with changing realities .
there is a system of administrative cooperation between the authorities that issue the export lic@@ ences .
there are systems of cooperation between the police , Customs and other authorities to monitor and inter@@ cept illegal movements of cultural goods .

Sweden
contacts between Sweden and Russia have a history of over a thousand years including cultural exchanges .
today Sweden faces the challenge to intensify its cultural exchanges with Russia .
it gave a broad presentation of contemporary Swedish culture in nine Russian cities ( Moscow , St Petersburg and seven cities along , or in the vicinity of , the Volga ) .
within this project a large group of Swedish cultural workers were able to meet with Russian colleagues .
the groundwork that was laid during " Sweden : upgrade " is now being built on .
the present dynamic Russian cultural scene opens new prospects for intensified exchange .
Sweden already regularly participates in art and photo exhibitions , such as the Moscow art and photo bi@@ en@@ n@@ ales , and film festivals ( first of all the Moscow Film Festival ) .
Swedish D@@ J@@ s regularly play at clubs in Russian cities .

do I need an export licence ?
Sweden
for foreign cultural goods , a permit is only required if the goods have been in Sweden for more than 100 years .
cultural goods which come under this legislation ( relevant categories apply , plus age and value thresholds ) must have an EU export licence .
the regulations for export lic@@ ences apply to anyone who is exporting cultural goods from Sweden to another country .
they apply , whatever your nationality , citizenship , place of residence or age .
they apply whether you are an individual , a company ( commercial or non @@@ -@@ @ profit ) , a public institution or other organisation .
they are explained in English and Swedish at : http : / / www.@@ ra@@ a.@@ se / c@@ ms / exter@@ n / en / cultural _ heritage / legislation _ and _ responsibility / ex@@ portation _ of _ cultural _ objec@@ ts@@ .@@ html
are there different types of licence ?
if you are exporting cultural goods from Sweden to Russia you will need both lic@@ ences , in order to comply with national and international regulations .
this is explained in more detail in Chapter 2 .
what are my first steps ?
how do I plan this process and how long might it take ?
whatever the type of cultural object , you only have to deal with one authority - the National Heritage Board .
you can get application forms from the National Heritage Board , which is also where you send the applications .
different application forms apply for the national and EU lic@@ ences but you follow the same application procedure .
if you want to export the object outside the European Union , you should note that you need two different forms .
attach two photographs of the object to the application .
the documents are forwarded by the National Heritage Board to the permit authority responsible for the particular category of art object you are applying for .
you need to make sure that the art object is accessible if the authority wants to inspect it .
five different authorities with expert knowledge make the actual decisions .
the National Library of Sweden and the National Archi@@ ves take care of applications concerning books and manuscripts .
the Nor@@ dis@@ ka M@@ use@@ et is responsible for furniture and the National Museum with Prince E@@ ug@@ ens Wal@@ dem@@ ar@@ sud@@ de makes decisions about various kinds of art work .
the National Heritage Board is in charge of ancient relics and archaeological objects , among other things .
the waiting period for delivery of the permit can vary depending on which permit authority is handling your application .
it is recommended that you apply in good time , at least four weeks before you plan to export the object .
how do I find out if the art object I want to export is of national significance ?
is there a Public Invent@@ ory of cultural goods of special interest or importance ?
there is an index with pictures and descriptions of " Old cultural objects prohibited to export " ( furniture and inventories prohibited to export outside the European Union ) at : http : / / www.@@ e@@ oc@@ o@@ .org / link@@ 1.@@ html
are there any exemptions for particular cultural goods ?
Swedish archaeological objects , whatever the material and value , that date from before 16@@ 50 and that are owned by the State are exemp@@ ted from the obligation to obtain a national export licence .
Swedish archaeological objects , owned by the State , will need an EU export licence for export outside the EU .
do museums and galleries need lic@@ ences for temporary exports ( e.g. a touring exhibition ) ?
do non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisations need export lic@@ ences ?
museums , galleries and non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisations must apply for lic@@ ences .
a museum or gallery is more likely to be arranging a temporary loan of an object for an exhibition abroad rather than seeking a permanent export .
do I need a licence to export my own work ?
art work which belongs to " the origin@@ ator " ( i.e. the artist who created it ) does not require an export licence under the EU export licence legislation , whatever its age or value .
the same applies under Swedish national legislation .
therefore you do not need a licence to export your own work if you still own it yourself .
do I need to know about export regulations if I am travelling with my instrument ?
any musician who wishes to travel outside the European Union with a musical instrument which is over a certain age and value must obtain an EU export licence ( as described in Chapter 2 ) .
this applies whether the export is temporary , e.g. for a concert tour , or permanent .
but you still need to go through the application process .
I am a tourist visiting Sweden .
if I buy a work of art , how do I take it home with me ?
the export regulations apply to anyone who wants to take cultural goods of a certain age and value from Sweden to Russia ( or to another country ) .
you must go through the application process with the Swedish national authorities in order for the goods to be cleared for export .
chapter 3 : European Union Member States
Sweden to arrange for transportation at a later date .
there are no duties or taxes to be paid on export but there may be customs duties to pay .
does the cultural object need to be valued ?
if so , who will do this ?
both the EU and Swedish national legislation have value and age thresholds which determine which cultural objects require export lic@@ ences .
therefore , if the age , value or other determin@@ ants need to be assessed , the cultural object may have to be inspected .
if an export licence is refused , can I appeal ?
how do I do that ?
if an export permit application has been refused by a licensing authority , you can make an appeal at a general administrative court .
special permission ( " leave to appeal " ) is required if you want to make an appeal to an Administrative Court of Appeal .
the court can decide on valuation .
which customs authorities are empowered to deal with the export of cultural goods ?
all customs authorities in Sweden are empowered to deal with the export of cultural goods .
what other paperwork do I need to export a cultural object ?
when you enter Russia , you must show all the relevant documentation and declare the object at customs , passing through the Red channel .
see Chapter 4 for further information .
what are the penalties if I do something wrong ?
if you are convicted for smuggling an object , the object will be confiscated .
sentences range from fines to two years imprisonment .
the provisions concerning penalties for the illegal export of cultural goods from Sweden and for attempted offences of this kind are contained in the S@@ mu@@ ggling Pen@@ alties Act ( 2000 : 12@@ 25 ) .
what are the standards of service I can expect to receive ?
the National Heritage Board ab@@ ides by the principle of public access to official documents .
for more information see : http : / / www.@@ sw@@ ed@@ en@@ .@@ gov@@ .@@ se / s@@ b / d / 28@@ 53 / a / 180@@ 96 .
are there any special export restrictions on certain objects or other considerations I should know about ?
permission for the export of cultural goods from Sweden will be given if the goods are not of major importance to the national cultural heritage .
even if the goods are of major importance to national cultural heritage , permission may be given for their export if they are acquired by an institution abroad .
what are the requirements if I want to import cultural goods into Sweden from Russia ?
as is normal , when importing goods from a country outside the EU , the importer has to report to the Swedish customs office , fill in a declaration and pay the charges .
there is no duty payable on " works of art , collectors " pieces and anti@@ ques " but the VAT ( 25 % ) must be paid .
if the goods are imported temporarily and it is planned to re @@@ -@@ @ export them later ( e.g. works for an exhibition ) , you must still contact the customs office and fill in the declaration .
in these circumstances , a security for the VAT must be paid and this will be returned when the goods leave Sweden .
the goods must not be repaired or altered in any way during the period in Sweden in this case .
the ATA @@@ -@@ @ car@@ net is a way of simpli@@ fying the procedure for temporary import@@ ation and if you use this , a security must still be paid by the importer .

this category includes , among other things , objects for which an export author@@ isation was requested , but the subsequent expert opinion led Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a to enter them in public ro@@ sters and registers .
movable objects that form part of the cultural heritage of the peoples of the Russian Federation are included by federal authorities in a special State list or code ( called s@@ v@@ od ) , which is deposited at Ros@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a .
the specific procedure for temporary export author@@ isations applies only to those cultural goods whose export is banned under art .
9 of the Cultural Goods Export and Import Law ( for more details , see the answer to the question , " Are there any restrictions on classes of objects to be taken out ?
what other special rules do I need to know about ? " further in this section ) .
understandably enough , requests for temporary export author@@ isations come most frequently from museums ( since they own treasures listed in Russia 's Museum Stock ) .
the application form for temporary export of cultural goods is available at this address : http : / / new@@ .@@ ro@@ so@@ hr@@ anc@@ ul@@ t@@ .ru / works / import / .
a further condition for cultural goods to be allowed out temporarily is an agreement between the applicant and Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a on repatriation of the cultural goods being taken out of the country .
finally , any cultural goods exported temporarily are examined twice - before they are taken out and when they have been brought back after temporary absence .
Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a is required to notify the applicant of its decision within three months of the official request filing date .
an un@@ favourable decision may be appealed against in court .
I am a freelance artist .
do I need an author@@ isation to export my own works ?
accordingly , the creator of cultural goods should follow the general rules in approaching Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a with a request for an author@@ isation to export the cultural objects he / she has created and owns at the time of the request .
this registration certificate or pas@@ port is a document intended for musicians who live in Russia and travel often outside Russia on tours of foreign countries .
I am a foreign tourist .
if I buy a painting or another work of art , how can I take it back home with me ?
if you have bought a sou@@ ven@@ ir or a culture @@@ -@@ @ related item , you are neither required to request an author@@ isation from Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a to export it , nor to declare it in writing at the customs .
nevertheless , if customs are un@@ decided about clearing it immediately , they may ask you to show them a reference document or sp@@ rav@@ ka from Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a that your object is of no cultural value .
yes , it is set out in the Cultural Objects Export and Import Law , and the Tax Code imposes the following limits on the export charge :
the stamp duty is charged on cultural goods exported ( permanently or for a limited time ) on the basis of their market value stated by the applicant in his / her request .
are cultural goods intended for export examined by experts ?
examination is done for a charge because it is considered a professional service , to be paid for by the applicants .
the amount and charge fixing criteria are set out in the Regulations approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of Culture in its Order No. 8@@ 88 of June 4 2002 .
what can I do if I don '@@ t agree with the expert 's opinion ?
you C@@ AN@@ NOT appeal against the expert 's report until the whole author@@ isation process is completed .
can one appeal against a decision denying the right to export cultural goods permanently or temporarily ?
how can this be done ?
the request for temporary export of cultural goods may also be denied if the Russian Federation does not have diplomatic relations with the government of the country where it is intended to take the cultural goods for a short period .
the decision to deny temporary export may be reversed by Ros@@ s@@ v@@ yaz@@ ok@@ h@@ ran@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a ( if duly requested to do so ) , or appealed against by the owner of the cultural goods in a court of law .
does violation of export and import legislation carry any liability ?
another Criminal Code article , 16@@ 4 , imposes liability for the theft of objects and documents of special historic , scientific , artistic or cultural value .
what " standards of service , " if at all , exist in respect of author@@ isation of export of cultural goods ?
" standards of service " as such have not existed as a regulatory and statutory framework for export and import of cultural goods .
are there any restrictions on classes of objects to be exported ?
what other special rules do I need to know about ?
these restrictions notwithstanding , cultural objects listed in paragraphs ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) can be temporarily exported from Russia .
this possibility does not apply to Russian citizens going abroad for a temporary stay only .
article 38 of the Cultural Objects Export and Import Law gives priority to the state to purchase cultural goods intended for export .
in theory , there is no distinction between customs organisations authorised to clear cultural goods and those that are not .
other documents to be produced to the customs are those certi@@ fying the origin and value of the cultural goods imported into Russia .
not all customs houses have qualified experts on their staff .
it is therefore suggested that you find out well in advance whether the customs house you want to take your cultural object through has any .

however , funding is expensive , which often leads to science suffering when states formulate their research policies .
European tax legislation was also amended to facilitate the establishment of such ventures .
the European Research Area seeks to address these concerns by improving the infrastructure of research in Europe and by focusing strengths and resources in specific areas .
Europe is one of the world 's recognised research centres , generating about a third of the planet 's scientific knowledge .
Europeans are confident that they can and must achieve much more , particularly as Europe trails the United States and Japan , its two leading competitors , in many areas .
the share of gross domestic product dedicated to research is 3.1 % in Japan and 2.7 % in the US , but less than 2 % in Europe .

young scientists are particularly important to the European Research Area .
it is no secret that science has declined in popularity somewhat , and Europe suffers from a lack of qualified scientists in certain sectors , for example in information technology .
scientific cooperation with the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states has also been fostered .
the greatest share of these resources is designed to focus and integrate research according to the following seven themes :

a single market ...
• Since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , a fundamental aim of the European Union h@@ as@@ been sustainable economic and social progress , so as to ensure health , wealth and a@@ promising future for Europeans .
closer integration in many policy areas has been vital to@@ achieve this aim .
... with a single currency ...
• The introduction of the euro is a milestone in the development of the Union and the biggest monetary change@@ over@@ in history .
the euro is the tangible result of EMU .
... for a closer Union
• However , EMU is not a one @@@ -@@ @ off event - it is work in progress by the euro @@@ -@@ @ area members , who co @@@ -@@ @ operate on@@ economic policy .
the new Member States also committed themselves to joining EMU and the euro in their acc@@ ession@@ treaties .
to do so , they need to align their economies carefully with those of existing members .
this econom@@ ic@@ alignment , known as " convergence , " is yet another step on the road to closer EU integration .
through progressive enlargement the EU has gained the benefits of size .
the sing@@ l@@ emar@@ ket is the main catalyst for real@@ ising these benefits .
on 1 January 2002 , euro bank@@ notes and coins were introduced in the largest mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ change@@ over in history .
foreign governments use the euro for borrowing and as a@@ reserve currency , taking advantage of its liquidity , conver@@ tibility and stability .
an opportunity for the new Member States
the ten new Member States committed themselves to EMU and the euro as part of their accession treaties .
they are@@ now members of EMU " with a der@@ og@@ ation " and will adopt the euro when their national economies meet th@@ econ@@ ver@@ gence criteria .
they must follow policies that lead to convergence in a range of economic indicators -@@ the Maastricht criteria .
EMU and the euro will bring many benefits - but the road@@ to the euro area must be navig@@ ated with care .
ensuring a stable , sound and sustain@@ able@@ economy : the Maastricht criteria
the EU set the Maastricht criteria as the original conditions for entry into the euro area by the found@@ ing@@ members .
keeping to them ensures sufficient alignment for a sustainable and stable euro @@@ -@@ @ area economy .
this measures the ro@@ bust@@ ness of the economy and the stability of real conver@@ g@@ ence@@ by showing that the government can manage the economy without resorting to currency depreciation .
table 1 shows how far the new Member States met the Maastricht criteria in 200@@ 31 .
full participation in EMU and the euro will bring man@@ y@@ added benefits - but only for an economy that is well prepared .
table 1 : the Maastricht convergence criteria in@@ the new Member States
Sustain@@ able@@ public finances
Govern@@ ment@@ deficit as % of GDP
as Table 1 shows , in 2003 many new Member States met some of the Maastricht criteria , although this can@@ change from year to year .
this growth is desirable but it can produc@@ e@@ inflationary pressures .
these pressures must be controlled to maintain economic growth without exc@@ essi@@ ve@@ price inflation . • Sever@@ al new Member States do not meet the 3 % target on the government deficit .
the 3 % limit is intended top@@ rev@@ ent deficits getting out of control .
however , strong control of budget deficits is a sign of sound finances , which helps attract foreign investment and promote growth .
on entering ER@@ M @@@ -@@ @ II , each country will fix an exchange rate against the euro and keep it stable within a ± 15 % band for tw@@ o@@ years .
convergence and partnership - in the interest of all
the new Member States are catching up with the rest of the European Union .
per capita GDP is much less than@@ the EU average - but it is rising as their economies grow .
this is the " real convergence " process .
each new Member State will follow a different path to the euro , entering on@@ ly@@ when the criteria are met and the country is able to gain most benefit within the Stability and Growth Pact .

as consumers can shop more easily across borders and compare prices , there is more competition between shops and suppliers .
consumers have more choice , some prices are lower , and price rises are kept in check .
in the 1970s and 1980s many Member States had very high inflation rates , some of 20 % and more .
inflation fell as they started preparing for the euro and , since its introduction , has remained around 2 % in the euro area . low and stable inflation benefits everyone .
€ fact : in December 2006 , the value of euro bank@@ notes and coins in circulation over@@ took the value of US dollar cash in circulation .
and the euro is readily exchanged in many countries outside the euro area as well - up to 20 % of euro bank@@ notes are estimated to circul@@ ate outside the euro area .

it is true that some sovereignty is voluntarily pool@@ ed when a country adopts the euro , as governments must coordinate their economic policies and control their spending .

generally , economic and monetary union ( EMU ) is part of the process of economic integration .
independent states can integrate their economies to varying degrees in order to achieve the benefits of size , such as greater internal efficiency and more ro@@ bust@@ ness to external events .
the degrees of economic integration can be divided into six steps .
a preferential trading area ( with reduced customs tariffs between certain countries ) 2 .
a free trade area ( with no internal tariffs on some or all goods between the participating countries ) 3 .
a customs union ( with the same external customs tariffs for third countries and a common trade policy ) 4 .
a common market ( with common product regulations and free movement of goods , capital , labour and services ) 5 .
economic and monetary union ( a single market with a single currency and monetary policy ) 6 .
complete economic integration ( all the above plus harmon@@ ised fiscal and other economic policies )
economic IN@@ TE@@ GR@@ ATION AND EMU IN EURO@@ PE
all Member States in the EU are part of what we call EMU and form a common market , known as the single market .
they all coordinate their economic policymaking to support the aims of EMU .
adopting the euro is an obligation laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community ( the Treaty or EC Treaty ) .
several Member States are more integrated and have adopted a single currency - the euro .
these countries form the euro area and , as well as the single currency , have a single monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank .
those Member States which are not part of the euro area retain their own currencies and conduct their own monetary policies .
so , the degree of economic integration within EMU is a hybrid of steps 4 and 5 in the list above .
to reach complete economic integration would require all Member States to join the euro area and harmon@@ ise their fiscal policies , including taxation , and other economic policies .
against this troubling background , and with the customs union largely achieved , the Community was anxious to set itself new goals for political development during the next decade .
the 1969 Bar@@ re Report , which proposed greater economic coordination , brought new impetus , and EMU became a formal goal at a summit in The Hague in 1969 .
the final objective would be irre@@ voc@@ ably convertible currencies , free movement of capital , and the permanent locking of exchange rates - or possibly a single currency .
to achieve this , the report called for closer economic policy coordination with interest rates and management of reserves decided at Community level , as well as agreed frameworks for national budgetary policies .
while the Member States were divided over some of the report 's main recommendations , they agreed in principle in March 1971 on a three @@@ -@@ @ stage approach to EMU .
the first stage , nar@@ rowing of exchange @@@ -@@ @ rate fluctuations , was to be tried on an experimental basis without any commitment to the other stages .
unfortunately , the Wer@@ ner strategy took fixed exchange rates against the dollar for granted .
a new proposal for EMU was put forward in 1977 by the then President of the European Commission , Roy Jen@@ kins .
in the first few years , there were many real@@ ign@@ ments in the EMS .
define the future governance of the euro area .
achieve economic convergence between the Member States .
stage 3 ( 1999 onwards )
the ECB and ESC@@ B are responsible for independent monetary policy making .
implement binding budgetary rules in the Member States .
with agreement on the goal ( EMU ) and the conditions ( the Maastricht criteria ) , the European Union could now move forward .
stage two of EMU began in July 1994 and lasted until the introduction of the single currency in 1999 .
within stage two , a wide variety of preparatory activities were initiated .
the European Monetary Institute ( EM@@ I ) was established in Frankfurt in 1994 .
the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the ECB , the EM@@ I began to coordinate monetary policy among the national central banks , which the Maastricht Treaty required to be independent , as well as working on the details of the single currency .
the 1995 Madrid European Council agreed on the name for the new currency - the euro - and set out the scenario for the transition to the single currency that would start on 1 January 1999 .
between 1994 and 1998 , Member States made significant progress in economic policy convergence and took steps to align their budgetary positions with the Maastricht criteria .
the 1997 Amsterdam European Council agreed the rules and responsibilities of the Stability and Growth Pact ( S@@ GP ) that aims to ensure budgetary discipline under EMU .
the European Commission was given the key responsibility of monitoring adherence to the S@@ GP .
the cash change@@ over was completed within two months .
national bank@@ notes and coins ceased to be legal tender by the end of February 2002 at the latest , and earlier in some Member States .
by that time , more than 6 billion bank@@ notes and close to 30 billion national coins had been withdrawn , and for over 300 million citizens in 12 countries the euro had finally arrived .
the operations and institutions of EMU were designed from the outset to support these objectives through the management of the monetary and economic aspects of the euro area .
the euro area has one currency with one monetary policy and independent , centr@@ alised decision making .
the ECB and the central banks of all EU Member States form the European System of Central Banks ( ESC@@ B ) .
decisions on monetary policy in the euro area can only be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB , which comprises the governors of the national central banks of those Member States that have adopted the euro and the members of the Executive Board of the ECB .
the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 are part of EMU - which means that they coordinate their economic policymaking with the other EU Member States and that their central banks are part of the ESC@@ B .
this status is granted by the Act of Acc@@ ession and oblig@@ es them to become full members of the euro area eventually .
the new Member States did not join the euro area immediately upon accession because they did not meet the convergence criteria .
the Treaty of Acc@@ ession therefore allows them time to undertake the adjustments needed to achieve convergence .
the convergence criteria - the Maastricht criteria - are the economic targets and institutional changes that a country must achieve before adopting the single currency and entering the euro area .
the macroeconomic indicators shown in Table 1 are used as a measure of convergence .
while countries that want to join the euro area have to meet the convergence criteria , the actual process of introducing the euro may differ among later entrants .
in this " Madrid scenario , " as it is called , a three @@@ -@@ @ year transitional period allows individuals and businesses to prepare for the single currency before it appears in their pockets .
during this transitional period , they still use their national currency for cash transactions .
the institutional framework for managing EMU has proved a clear success and reflects the strong commitment of the euro area Member States to cooperate on economic issues of " common concern . "
this cooperation is vital for the growth and jobs - and rising living standards - that the single market and EMU support .
single countries , such as the United States and Japan , have a centr@@ alised monetary policy and a centr@@ alised fi fiscal policy operated by a single government .
in the euro area , things are different .
therefore , the cooperation and coordination between euro area Member States on matters of fiscal policy is the key element that drives economic and monetary union .
EMU is built on several strong groupings that have together proved successful in managing its operations : N@@ u l l
inflation convergence : euro area 12 ( annual % increases )
dealing with multiple currencies entails costs and makes price comparisons difficult , even within the single market .
the single currency - the euro - removes these disadvantages and brings benefits to both consumers and businesses .
the euro is a strong international currency .
table 2 compares some major economic indicators of the euro area and the EU with the United States and Japan :
GDP ( in trillion EUR calculated at purchasing power parity )

around 14 billion euro bank@@ notes were produced , worth EUR 6@@ 33 billion , and 52 billion euro coins - using 250 000 tonnes of metal - in preparation for the euro launch .
around 7.8 billion bank@@ notes worth EUR 140 billion were available in the euro area on the morning of 1 January 2002 when euro cash was launched .
since then , demand has grown continuously as the graph to the right shows ( the peaks in the growth are due to extra demand for bank@@ notes around the Christmas period ) :
by the end of 2006 , there were over 11 billion euro bank@@ notes in circulation with a value of over EUR 6@@ 20 billion and nearly 70 billion euro coins with a value of nearly EUR 18 billion - the notes can be withdrawn from over 250 000 AT@@ Ms in the euro area .

" there are so many sites developed specifically so I can compare prices across a number of countries using the euro .
over the past five years I 've noticed I 'm actually finding some of the cheapest deals right at home .
I guess local retailers are trying to get my business back .
with the savings I can get something for myself ! "
23 and lower inflation
average inflation in the euro@@ area countries fell from 9.3 % in the 1970s and 7.5 % in the 1980s to 2.1 % since 1999 .
in Portugal , inflation averaged 8 % in the early 1990s , but dropped in the run @@@ -@@ @ up to the euro to around 2 % , where it is now .
the central task of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is to maintain price stability .
a low , controlled inflation rate and a stable currency enable businesses and individuals to plan for the future and living standards to be maintained .
this has led some people to believe that the euro brought higher prices , but consumer price data has shown consistently that this is not the case .
" fortunately , the euro seems to have changed things .
my savings seem to keep their value better , which means that I can plan my spending better and even have something left over for my retirement . "
Maria and George Sav@@ vas have recently bought their own home in Rhodes , Greece .
for example , a Greek who buys a house for € 100,000 with a 15 @@@ -@@ @ year loan will now pay around € 7@@ 90 each month compared to almost € 1,@@ 100 in 1999 .
over the 15 years , he or she will have saved around € 5@@ 5,000 .
W as an investment for the future and to give
interest re@@ payments on government debt have also fallen , saving several billion euros a year of taxpayers " money in some cases , which can be used instead to consolidate national budgets or invest in public services .
for example , Italy 's debt @@@ -@@ @ servicing costs in 2005 were about 6 % lower than in the 1990s , saving about € 1,@@ 4@@ 15 per capita .
Bank loans for house purchases were very limited and quite expensive .
and as the economy seems more stable than before , we are more confident that the re@@ payments won '@@ t be too high in the future .
our generation is the first to enjoy these opportunities that the euro has created . "

the costs of exchanging money are eliminated in the euro area , making it cheaper to travel , whether on vacation , studying , or on business .
these businesses also benefit because the costs associated with exchanging currencies have gone .

the volume of euro @@@ -@@ @ denominated bonds issued has grown substantially to rival and , by some measures , even over@@ take the dollar on international debt markets .
" with the economic stability fostered by a single central bank , I can feel more confident about investing in the euro area , especially since it has made the flow of money easier .

a commitment to sound public finances is one of the corner@@ stones of Economic and Monetary Union .
the government ran up huge deficits , which put an increasing burden on public finances .
the rules on sound and sustainable public finances mean that euro@@ area Member States live within their means and do not build up excessive debts that will burden future generations of taxpayers .
this is important as Europe is ageing , and in the future there will be fewer working people supporting more pensioners .
our purchasing power is better preserved because inflation is low , but we do worry about their future .
we know the ageing population in Europe could cause problems in the fut@@ ure@@ .@@ That 's why we believe it 's important for the government to keep its public finances in order .
the euro has emerged as a key international currency and the euro area as a new economic entity comparable only to the US .
a world currency
the euro is also used as a reference currency by around 40 countries , particularly neighbouring countries or those which have special institutional arrangements with the EU , for example candidates for membership .
many people outside the euro area use the euro as a parallel currency , for example for their savings .
this usage is estimated at around € 70 billion .
in 2006 , the euro over@@ took the US dollar to become the currency with the largest value of notes in circulation .

6 Con@@ clu@@ sions for EN@@ P and Russia : steps toward convergence
7 Fur@@ ther Information
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was created in 2003 / 2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries .
it is a collective EU response to the aspirations of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity , stability and security in our region .
the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
the political , economic , social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East - Belar@@ us@@ 1 , Ukraine , Moldova and the Southern Caucasus , and to the South , in the Mediterranean region , are wor@@ ry@@ ingly large and in certain cases increasing .
the EU wants to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours .
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy represents a new approach in the EU 's relations with its neighbours .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 2 .
it goes beyond classical co @@@ -@@ @ operation : it consists of intensified political dialogue and deeper economic relations , based on shared values and common interest in tackling common problems .
the EN@@ P is not about membership of the EU - if an accession perspective were to be offered at some point in the future to any of the countries covered by the EN@@ P , this would be a separate process .
the necessary legal and institutional framework for intensified cooperation with EN@@ P partners are Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements or Association Agre@@ ements .
the tools , however , to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed , tailor @@@ -@@ @ made EN@@ P Action Pl@@ ans@@ 3 with short and medium term priorities ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years ) .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
in that context , it goes further than promoting sustainable development and fighting poverty to encompass , for example , considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU 's internal market .
legislative and regulatory convergence and institution building is supported through mechanisms such as the exchange of experience , long term tw@@ inning arrangements with Member States or participation in Community programmes and agencies .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA and T@@ AC@@ IS and other existing geographical and thematic instruments .
the Commission has set up a website explaining the EN@@ P and its processes and containing key EN@@ P documents such as the Strategy P@@ apers , the Action Plans and Progress Reports .
please refer to : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / world / EN@@ P / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m.
EN@@ P partner countries are expected to benefit considerably from full implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including from enhanced convergence with the EU approaches .
for benefits resulting from enhanced environment protection , including convergence , please refer to Chapter 3 .
in order to help partner countries to realise these benefits , the European Commission has decided to provide information on EU environment policy and legislation in key policy areas .
climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU 's environmental cooperation with partner countries , which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address .
the purpose of this policy guide on water is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioriti@@ s@@ ation and sequ@@ encing of activities .
the guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environment policy and legislation can assist the EN@@ P partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
this includes summar@@ ising the main provisions of the legislation .
the guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean EN@@ P partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence .
finally , it identifies useful steps to be taken to promote convergence .
since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably , the guides take a general approach and references to specific countries are not made .
the relevance of full or partial convergence is also to be seen in this light .

the problems that this policy aims to address
convergence to European water legislation may create the following benefits : TS :
3 Ex@@ p@@ ected Benef@@ its of Conver@@ gence
convergence towards EU water legislation might bring a number of benefits to EN@@ P partner countries by contributing to more sustainable water management and reducing pollution .
convergence to the Dr@@ inking Water Directive might yield major benefits for the protection of human health and ensure that special attention is given to water intended for human consumption .
this Directive is also likely to be beneficial for many economic sectors , including food industry export and tourism .
uncontrolled discharge of un@@ treated waste water is a major problem in many EN@@ P partner countries and a large source of water pollution ; immediate action on waste water treatment is considered crucial by regional environmental organisations .
using the Urban W@@ aste Water Treatment Directive as a model could help EN@@ P partner countries control dis@@ charges and ensure sufficient treatment of waste water , thereby improving water quality and reducing health risks .
in regions where water is scarce , waste water treatment can also reduce the pressure on freshwater resources , for instance if treated waste water is used for irrigation or in industry .
legislation similar to the Ba@@ thing Water Directive could improve the quality of freshwater bodies and coastal waters .
convergence to this Directive might be particularly attractive to countries where basic pollution control systems are already in place .
improving the quality of bathing water can alleviate public health problems and improve recreation for the local population , while also making a region more attractive for tourism .
the nit@@ rates Directive is highly relevant for the control of water pollution from diff@@ use agricultural sources .
in countries where intensive agriculture is widespread and ex@@ erts significant pressure on water resources , convergence towards the nit@@ rate Directive can contribute significantly to improving water quality and preserving ecosystems .
the Water Framework Directive ( W@@ F@@ D ) is a very complex piece of legislation , making full convergence not possible in all cases .
however , even the adoption of individual elements of the Directive might yield considerable benefits .
it also helps to avoid that what is done in one section of the river counter@@ acts efforts undertaken in another .
convergence to the W@@ F@@ D would also strengthen public participation in EN@@ P partner countries , and thus foster ownership among stakeholders .
for EN@@ P partner countries with coastal waters , the Marine Strategy could serve as a potential model .
4 Overview of EU Water Policy
water and water pollution were among the first environmental concerns in the EU .
the first pieces of EU water legislation were accepted by the European Council as early as 1973 .
since then , European water legislation has taken a leading and innovative role in the design of national water policy in many EU Member States .
there have been two important periods of EU water legislation .
in the Water Quality Ob@@ j@@ ective ( W@@ Q@@ O ) approach , minimum quality requirements of water are defined in order to limit the cumulative impact due to emissions , both from point sources and diff@@ use sources .
in the E@@ mission Lim@@ it Value ( EL@@ V ) approach , focus is on the maximum allowed quantities of pollutants that may be discharged from a particular source into waters .
this approach looks at the end product of a process ( waste water treatment , dis@@ charges from industry ) or what quantities of pollutants may go into water .
the concept of best available technology ( B@@ AT ) has developed as a key element of setting EL@@ Vs , especially for the larger , more poll@@ uting industries .
bat den@@ otes the most effective and advanced techniques that are currently available and that are sufficiently developed to allow implementation under economically and technically viable conditions .
the concept is used to define how practical individual techniques are for preventing or reducing emissions of pollutants , and can serve as a basis for the definition of EL@@ Vs .
these second @@@ -@@ @ period Direc@@ tives mainly followed the EL@@ V approach with respect to water pollution control at the source , both from point and from diff@@ use sources .
however , this pi@@ ec@@ em@@ eal evolution on a problem @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ problem basis has led to a complex picture of water Direc@@ tives with differing and often conflicting methodologies , definitions and aims .
furthermore , the water Direc@@ tives were often less successful in environmental outcome than expected .
the W@@ F@@ D provides a framework for the protection of all water bodies and is based on a combined approach of W@@ Q@@ Os and EL@@ Vs .
• achieving " good status " 7@@ already exists ;
box 1 lists all main pieces of EU water and related legislation .
the following sections present selected elements of EU water policy in more detail .
more information about EU water policy and the full text of legislation and other documents is available at the Commission 's web@@ sit@@ e.@@ 8
box 1 EU water and related legislation
the Framework Legis@@ lation • Water Framework Directive ( W@@ F@@ D ) ( 2000 / 60 / EC ) .
it applies to all water intended for human consumption , as well as water used in the production and marketing of food .
the main instruments used for managing drinking water quality are standard @@@ -@@ @ setting and the specification of detailed monitoring requirements .
the Dr@@ inking Water Directive sets standards for a number of micro@@ biological and chemical parameters , scientifically based on WHO guidelines .
member States may include additional parameters or use higher standards , but they may not go below the standards set by the Directive .
member States are required to monitor the quality of drinking water and take measures to ensure that it complies with minimum quality standards .
the quality targets need to be met at the point of use , i.e. the tap .
monitoring results are reported to the Commission at regular intervals and information on drinking water quality has to be made available to the public .
the Dr@@ inking Water Directive has led to large investments in water distribution networks .
in a Syn@@ thesis Report on the quality of drinking water in the EU Member States in the period 1993 @@@ -@@ @ 95 , it was concluded that the general quality of drinking water supplied to European citizens had reached a high status .
the general objective of EU legislation on bathing water has been to ensure the good quality of bathing water , both freshwater and coastal water , over time .
this objective was not only motivated by public health considerations , but also by reasons of amen@@ ity .
the main issue in achieving this goal is the prevention of the pollution of bathing waters by sewage eff@@ lu@@ ents .
the 1976 Ba@@ thing Directive is one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation in Europe .
a new Directive was adopted in 2006 that will replace and repeal the older one by 2014 at the latest .
the main instruments of the Ba@@ thing Directive are water quality standards for bathing water , monitoring requirements , reporting requirements and requirements for measures to ensure compliance with the standards .
be actively involved in the development of the management plan .
if the quality standards are not respected , remedi@@ al measures must be taken .
the quality of water at designated bathing beaches in Europe ( coastal and inland ) has improved throughout the 1990s .
in 2002 , The Netherlands even reached 100 % compliance with the mandatory standards in coastal waters .
in general , Member States have invested significant amounts of money to achieve the prescribed standards .
the implementation of the Urban Wa@@ ste@@ water Treatment Directive has also contributed significantly to the general improvement of surface water quality including bathing waters .
the Urban W@@ aste Water Treatment Directive ( U@@ WW@@ T@@ D ) concerns :
the Directive sets targets and limit values which the treatment efforts must reach .
moreover , monitoring and evaluating procedures for the results are specified .
in the case of excessive costs for treatment systems , alternative systems may be used to achieve the same level of environmental protection .
additionally , the Directive regulates the disposal of sewage sl@@ udge .
the dumping of sl@@ udge at sea or other surface waters was mandated for phase out by 1998 .
with respect to industrial waste water , dis@@ charges into collecting systems and treatment plants are subject to prior regulation and / or specific author@@ isation , and subject to forms of specified pre @@@ -@@ @ treatment .
these include the provision that the resulting sl@@ udge can be disposed of safely in an environmentally acceptable manner .
box 3 Im@@ pro@@ vement of wastewater treatment from implementing the U@@ WW@@ T@@ D
since the 1980s , marked changes have occurred in the proportion of European population connected to wastewater treatment and in the technology involved .
implementation of the Urban W@@ aste Water Treatment Directive ( U@@ WW@@ T@@ D ) has largely influenced this trend .
especially in several countries in north @@@ -@@ @ western Europe , there has been a marked increase in the population connected to tertiary waste water treatment in the 1990s resulting in reductions in phosph@@ orus and nitrogen dis@@ charges .
in central European countries , more than half of the wastewater is treated by tertiary treatment .
this is because policies to reduce eut@@ roph@@ ication and improve bathing water quality were implemented earlier in the Nordic and central than in the southern , eastern and Acc@@ ession countries .
improved treatment of wastewater has resulted in improvement of the state of water bodies with a decrease in concentration of pollutants over the past ten years , although nit@@ rate pollution continues to be a problem in many regions .
in EU countries , these decreases are linked with the implementation of European legislation .
in fact , Member States have made considerable investments to achieve these improvements .
in the Acc@@ ession Countries , decrease of wastewater pollution is due to the general increase in the level and extent of waste water treatment and to the recession associated with the transition to market @@@ -@@ @ oriented economies .
ph@@ asing proposed for the implementation of the nit@@ rates Directive is differentiated for the case of design@@ ating individual nit@@ rate vulnerable zones and for the case of applying action programmes throughout a national territory .
in the case of individual vulnerable zone , first a monitoring programme should be established to collect information ( over at least one year ) to identify waters polluted by nit@@ rates .
secondly , action programmes should be prepared , including mandatory measures and voluntary codes of good agricultural practice for each vulnerable area .
third , action programmes should be implemented , undertaking training of farmers and establishing an ongoing monitoring programme and making frequent review of the programmes " e ec@@ tiveness .
secondly , the action programmes should be implemented , establishing a monitoring programme and a review of the effectiveness of measures taken .
the alternative of design@@ ating individual vulnerable zones requires extensive monitoring and investigation .
the overall purpose of the Water Framework Directive ( W@@ F@@ D ) is to establish a framework for the protection of European inland surface water , transitional waters , coastal waters and groundwater .
the environmental objective of the W@@ F@@ D is to achieve " good status " for all ground waters and surface waters by 2015 at the latest .
• Ap@@ pointing a central oversight body with river basin @@@ -@@ @ based subsidiary departments or institutions to organise and undertake day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day work in the river basins ; or
• Ap@@ pointing individual river basin institutions with direct control over the activities of each river basin .
international coordination is also required for those river basins that cross international boundaries .
central to each River Basin Management Plan is a Programme of Measures to ensure that all waters achieve good water status .
the monitoring of all waters in terms of quantity and quality , especially surface waters and groundwater , is an essential feature of the W@@ F@@ D .
the W@@ F@@ D sets deadlines for individual requirements .
the implementation of the Water Framework Directive raises a number of shared technical challenges for the Member States .
for this reason , the Member States , Norway and the Commission agreed on a Common Implementation Strategy ( CIS ) for the Water Framework Directive only five months after the entry into force of the Directive .
focus is on methodological questions related to a common understanding of the technical and scientific implications of the W@@ F@@ D .
costs for implementing the W@@ F@@ D
European policy on groundwater is concerned both with the quality and quantity of groundwater .
the current legislative framework consists of the provisions of the W@@ F@@ D concerning groundwater and those of the newly adopted Gr@@ ound@@ water Directive .
for groundwater , the W@@ F@@ D sets the key provisions concerning quantitative and chemical status objectives ( while the objectives for surface waters concern ecological and chemical status ; see above ) .
the quantitative status objectives are clearly formulated by the W@@ F@@ D , aiming to ensure a balance between abstraction and re@@ charge of groundwater , however chemical status criteria were left to a Dau@@ ghter Directive .
for this reason , the Dau@@ ghter Directive for groundwater was adopted on 12 December 2006 as a complement to the W@@ F@@ D , clari@@ fying good chemical status criteria and specifications related to the identification and reversal of pollution trends .
member States establish the standards at the most appropriate level , taking into account local or regional conditions .
further recent developments in EU Water Policy
EU policy on flood risk management
on 18 September 2007 , a new Directive on Flood Risk Management was adopted .
the aim of the new Directive is to reduce and manage the risks that floods pose to human health , the environment , infrastructure and property .
the Directive requires Member States to first carry out a preliminary assessment to identify the river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
for such zones , they will need to draw up flood risk maps and then flood risk management plans focused on prevention , protection and preparedness .
further , coordination and coherence between flood risk management and the Water Framework Directive has to be ensured .
a Marine Strategy to save Europe 's seas and oceans
this Marine Strategy Directive will establish European Marine Regions on the basis of geographical and environmental criteria .
each Member State , in close cooperation with the relevant other Member States and third countries within a Marine Region , will be required to develop Marine Strate@@ gies for its marine waters .
the Marine Strate@@ gies will contain a detailed assessment of the state of the environment , a definition of " good environmental status " at a regional level and the establishment of clear environmental targets and monitoring programmes .
each Member State will also draw up a programme of cost @@@ -@@ @ effective measures .
impact assessments , including a detailed cost @@@ -@@ @ benefit analysis of the measures proposed , will be required prior to the introduction of any new measure .
where impossible for a Member State to achieve environmental targets , special areas and situations will be identified in order to devise specific measures tailored to their particular contexts .
the Marine Strategy is consistent with the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 / EC .
communication on Water S@@ car@@ city and droughts
in recognition of the ac@@ ut@@ eness of water scarcity and drought challenges in Europe , the Commission has recently taken steps to address these problems .
in July 2007 , a Communication on Water S@@ car@@ city and droughts was launched , based on a current assessment of the water scarcity problem .
the Communication presents an initial set of policy options at the European , national and regional levels to address and mitigate the challenge posed by water scarcity and drought within the Union .
a St@@ ake@@ holder Forum that involved interested parties and stakeholders supported the development of the Communication .
the EU@@ W@@ I aims to bring different stakeholder activities together within a common framework , and to improve collaboration with partners in other regions .
as a result of a recent review , the EU@@ W@@ I will in future increasingly focus on regional components .
the EU@@ W@@ I has four regional components , two of which are of direct relevance for the EN@@ P partner countries .
EU@@ W@@ I @@@ -@@ @ EECCA is a partnership that seeks to improve the management of water resources in Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia .
the partnership is intended to build on and reinforce existing partnerships and bilateral and regional programmes by bringing partners with related water activities together within a common framework .
it is open to all stakeholders - governments , inter @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations , NGOs , academia , financing institutions , the private sector , etc .
EU@@ W@@ I @@@ -@@ @ ME@@ D is the regional component for the Mediterranean and includes all EN@@ P partner countries in the area .
three working groups address thematic topics of groundwater , water scarcity , and rural development .
it is envisaged to create a network of Mediterranean Pil@@ ot Bas@@ ins , with the aim of sharing specific experiences and giving concrete examples of water resources management according to the W@@ F@@ D.@@ 12
in addition , country policy dialogues have been set up with several countries under EU@@ W@@ I @@@ -@@ @ ME@@ D .

5 Current situation with respect to the water policy sector in EN@@ P partner countries and Russia
EU 's Eastern EN@@ P partner countries and Russia
in addition , regional co @@@ -@@ @ operation , application of Integrated Water Resources Management , and improved transboundary water management cooperation are defined as strategic objectives .
water pollution is a serious problem in the eastern EN@@ P partners , and deficits with regard to access to safe drinking water persist .
in some countries or regions , drinking water fails to meet sanitary standards , and high pollution of surface and groundwater water bodies presents a challenge to water management .
the most common pressures responsible for this pollution include :
• Radio@@ active pollution , • un@@ treated or in@@ sufficiently treated urban and industrial wastewater , • T@@ ox@@ ic chemicals , oil spills and industrial pollution , • Agricultural run @@@ -@@ @ o .
due to outdated water supply systems and insufficient maintenance , leakage rates are often high .
water management plays a role in all of the existing EN@@ P Action Plans , 13 although the strategic objectives are very different .
enhanced regional cooperation on water management issues is an aim for many countries .
water pollution is an issue for many countries as well , and the adoption of plans and programmes on water quality is a widespread objective .
institutional and administr@@ ational improvements are envisioned by Israel ( reporting ) , Lebanon ( monitoring network ) , and Morocco ( administrative structures ) .
enhanced water @@@ -@@ @ use efficiency in agriculture is mentioned in the Egyptian EN@@ P , while enhanced management of demand in all sectors is an aim for Lebanon .
the importance of strategic planning , including financial strategies , is emphasi@@ sed in the Action Plan of Morocco .
the Palestinian Authority places a focus on improvements in the overall water and sanitation management system , in particular in rural areas .
environmental problems related to water resources are severe in many Mediterranean regions .
• Water scarcity , • over@@ exploitation of water resources and unsustainable use , • un@@ treated or in@@ sufficiently treated urban and industrial wastewater , • Water pollution , • Poll@@ ution of coastal water .
all countries in the region have set up environmental authorities and ministries .
different authorities may be responsible for different aspects of water policy , with water ministries dealing with water quantity and environmental ministries managing water quality . the Ministry of Health also sometimes monitors water quality .
often the environment ministries have only limited jurisdiction over water issues .
in the Middle East , water management tends to focus on water supply , with wastewater management playing a minor role .

6 Con@@ clu@@ sions for EN@@ P and Russia : steps toward convergence
box 4 EU funding for EN@@ P
from the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 , the EU is providing financial support for the EN@@ P through a dedicated European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA ( for the Southern Mediterranean neighbours ) and T@@ AC@@ IS ( for the Eastern neighbours and the Russian Federation ) .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
there are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the EN@@ PI countries can benefit .
this includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy .
in real terms it means as increase of 32 % as compared with the previous financial framework .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
it can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate .
the following paragraphs suggest potential steps toward convergence and issues for consideration during the process .
stakeholder involvement should be ensured in all stages of implementation .
it is recommended to involve all actors and stakeholders contributing to policy development , as well as those a ect @@@ -@@ @ ed by the changes .
consultation processes should involve other central government ministries , regional and local government , water utility companies , industry , farmers groups , fishery groups , other water users , NGOs and the general public .
it should be realistically assessed to what extent the EN@@ P partner country can align with the EU Direc@@ tives and in what areas convergence can bring the greatest benefits .
• Legislative considerations : framework @@@ -@@ @ type legislation , such as the Water Framework Directive , may be adopted at an early stage , as it provides the outline for other daughter legislation .
usually the requirements for competent authorities and administrative infrastructure set up to meet framework legislation will suffice for the whole water sector .
adopting W@@ F@@ D elements at an early stage will also facilitate the implementation of integrated water management approaches .
however , it also must be kept in mind that the Water Framework Directive is a very complex legislation and that its functioning requires the existence of relatively advanced water legislation and institutional systems ( see Box 6 ) .
for instance , if agriculture plays an important role and if agricultural water pollution is a significant concern , convergence to the nit@@ rate Directive could be a priority issue .
legal gap analysis .
before the enlargement of the EU in 2004 , assessments were carried out on the efforts that would be needed in the New Member States ( N@@ MS@@ s ) to implement European environmental policy .
the EU requirements related to water quality and water pollution control were expected by the N@@ MS@@ s to be among the most difficult and expensive to implement .
most , if not all , of the accession countries asked for - and received - transition periods in this sector .
cost estimates largely depended on the existing level of connection to the public se@@ wer system in the accession countries , and on the extent and intensity of treatment before implementation of the Directive .
similarly , implementing the Dr@@ inking Water Directive also represented a major challenge for the N@@ MS@@ s , since it required large investment in drinking water distribution networks .
implementation of the nit@@ rate Directive can also be considered less challenging in terms of investment costs .
in the N@@ MS@@ s , nit@@ rate pollution was less of a problem at the time of accession than in the intensely f@@ armed parts of the EU .
however , in regions with intensive animal re@@ aring , farmers had to invest in man@@ ure storage facilities .
finally , implementing the Water Framework Directive is challenging with respect to fulfilling the institutional , administr@@ ational and monitoring requirements .
costs for implementing EU Direc@@ tives were estimated to be substantial , in particular in the case of the more investment @@@ -@@ @ heavy Direc@@ tives such as the U@@ WW@@ T@@ D .
however , large economic benefits in the range between 5 to 14 billion EUR were also predicted for the N@@ MS from compliance with EU legislation in the water sector .
the costs of implementing convergence should be estimated at an early stage and a financing strategy should be prepared .
financing investments and operation of water supply and se@@ wer@@ age systems will be a particular challenge ( e.g. Dr@@ inking Water Directive and U@@ WW@@ T@@ D ) and should be planned carefully , but institutional development may also require considerable resources .
in addition , charging systems and the cost recovery principle inherent in EU legislation may be a way to raise funds .
box 6 Conver@@ gence towards the Water Framework Directive
the W@@ F@@ D is supposed to replace other Direc@@ tives in the future .
for convergence , this means that the implementation of the W@@ F@@ D will only be effective and beneficial if well @@@ -@@ @ established water quality objectives and procedural and administrative rules are already part of the national legal and institutional framework .
a sound legal framework , democratic and effective institutions and well @@@ -@@ @ functioning courts are prerequisites .
water legislation must be in place that regulates permitting for water use and discharge , designation and protection of water bodies , compliance and enforcement .
W@@ F@@ D implementation also requires the adoption of water quality objectives and emission limit values .
with regard to institutions , the W@@ F@@ D requires management on the basis of river basins , as well as regional , national and transnational coordination between authorities , and inter @@@ -@@ @ agency coordination of activities .
clear and comprehensive mandates for all institutions , as well as precise responsibilities and accountability mechanisms are essential for the functioning of the system .
activities on water quality and water quantity must be co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ated .
furthermore , an effective implementation of the W@@ F@@ D requires a general legal system that protects access to environmental information , provides for environmental impact assessments , and supports the involvement of stakeholders .

the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was created in 2003 / 2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries .
it is a collective EU response to the aspirations of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity , stability and security in our region .
the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
the political , economic , social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East - Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and the Southern Caucasus , and to the South , in the Mediterranean region , are wor@@ ry@@ ingly large and in certain cases increasing .
the EU wants to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours .
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy represents a new approach in the EU 's relations with its neighbours .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 1 .
it goes beyond classical co @@@ -@@ @ operation : it consists of intensified political dialogue and deeper economic relations , based on shared values and common interest in tackling common problems .
the EN@@ P is not about membership of the EU - if an accession perspective were to be offered at some point in the future to any of the countries covered by the EN@@ P , this would be a separate process .
the necessary legal and institutional framework for intensified cooperation with EN@@ P partners are Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements or Association Agre@@ ements .
the tools , however , to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed , tailor @@@ -@@ @ made EN@@ P Action Pl@@ ans@@ 2 with short and medium term priorities ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years ) .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
in that context , it goes further than promoting sustainable development and fighting poverty to encompass , for example , considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU 's internal market .
the Commission has set up a web @@@ -@@ @ site explaining the EN@@ P and its processes and containing key EN@@ P documents such as the Strategy P@@ apers , the Action Plans and Progress Reports .
please refer to : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / world / EN@@ P / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m.
EN@@ P partner countries are expected to benefit considerably from full implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including from enhanced convergence with the EU approaches .
for benefits resulting from enhanced environment protection , including convergence , please refer to Chapter 3 .
in order to help partner countries to realise these benefits , the European Commission has decided to provide information on EU environment policy and legislation in key policy areas .
climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU 's environmental cooperation with partner countries , which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address .
documents on this crucial topic of common interest will be issued separately from this series of guides .
the purpose of this policy guide on waste is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioriti@@ s@@ ation and sequ@@ encing of activities .
the guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environment policy and legislation can assist the EN@@ P partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
this includes summar@@ ising the main provisions of the legislation .
the guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean EN@@ P partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence .
finally , it identifies useful steps to be taken to promote convergence .
since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably , the guides take a general approach and references to specific countries are not made .
the relevance of full or partial convergence is also to be seen in this light .

the problems that this policy aims to address :
EU waste policy aims to foster environmentally sound waste management .
the essential objective of all provisions relating to waste management should be the protection of human health and the environment against harmful effects caused by the collection , transport , treatment , storage and tipping of waste@@ .@@ 6
how the policy addresses these problems :
EU W@@ aste Policy , more con@@ cre@@ tely the W@@ aste Framework Directive , establishes a waste hierarchy by which it prioriti@@ ses the management and treatment of waste along the following lines :
• Prevention or reduction of waste production and its harm@@ fulness ; • Recovery of waste .
the safe disposal of waste e.g. in land@@ fills is only considered as a nal resort .
in order to facilitate rational waste management , which takes into account the mass and composition of waste and the real needs of a community / region , the W@@ aste Framework Directive prescri@@ bes waste management planning .
various specific directives regulate the management of specific waste streams and lay down a concrete objective for their recovery and recycling .
these directives all stipul@@ ate the separate collection of these waste streams .
other waste management directives lay down requirements for the different waste treatment methods , such as waste incin@@ eration and land@@ filling , and lay down minimum standards for these treatment methods .
this , in turn , reduces :
furthermore , a sophisticated waste management creates jobs in the administration ( planning and control of waste management ) and in the operative field ( waste collection and treatment ) .
some of these jobs are highly qualified especially when compared to the simple " dumping " of waste in uncontrolled land@@ f@@ ill@@ s. LL@@ S .
3 Ex@@ p@@ ected Benef@@ its of Conver@@ gence
convergence toward EU waste legislation may bring a number of benefits to EN@@ P partners by contributing to more sustainable waste management ( collection and treatment ) .
the W@@ aste Framework Directive sets the basic requirements for an environmentally friendly and sound waste management system .
convergence with this Directive could assist the EN@@ P partners in establishing a functioning infrastructure for waste management .
the Haz@@ ardous W@@ aste Directive sets additional requirements for the management of hazardous wastes .
convergence with this Directive would alleviate the environmental and health @@@ -@@ @ related pressures emanating from the current disposal practices of hazardous waste in many EN@@ P partner countries .
this Directive also as@@ signs waste authorities with the responsibility for planning hazardous waste management .
the W@@ aste Shi@@ pment Regulation implementing the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans@@ boundary Mov@@ ements of Haz@@ ardous W@@ astes and their Dis@@ pos@@ al sets specific requirements and restrictions for the shipment of waste in other countries , including countries that are not part of the EU .
this serves to uphold the auto @@@ -@@ @ sufficiency of each country , especially for the treatment of waste destined for disposal , and protects countries from being over@@ run by waste originating from other countries .
convergence with the W@@ aste Shi@@ pment Regulation and effective control of waste shipments would alleviate risks and burdens connected to ( hazardous ) waste imports for the EN@@ P partners .
in order to attain a certain environmental level of waste treatment , convergence of the EN@@ P partner countries with the basic waste treatment Direc@@ tives , the Land@@ ll Directive and the W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive is recommended .
the land@@ fill Directive provides for a controlled disposal of waste on land@@ fills featuring certain minimum requirements and contains stipul@@ ations for the after@@ care of land@@ fills .
convergence with this Directive , therefore , would contribute to preventing the pollution of soil and groundwater and reducing the frequency of polluted sites in the EN@@ P partner countries .
in addition to the basic waste treatment Direc@@ tives , convergence with the W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive would reduce and control emission levels of waste incin@@ eration plants .
this helps to ensure that the diversion of waste from land@@ fills to waste incin@@ eration does not result in additional health and environmental hazards as , for example , excessive emissions of di@@ ox@@ ins and fur@@ ans .
this , however , would require the establishment of separate collection regimes managed by the producers of the respective goods or the state .
therefore , these three Direc@@ tives constitute an advanced form of waste management .
there is a large number of EU Direc@@ tives and Regulations dealing with waste management .
the most important directives will be described in the following sections .
most importantly , the European framework of waste legislation has evolved along the following three lines :
the following sections will outline the basic stipul@@ ations of EU W@@ aste law .
basic Rules for W@@ aste Management
it dates from 1975 and was re @@@ -@@ @ edited in 2006 .
the Directive lays down the basic hierarchy of waste management and waste treatment and contains basic requirements for the waste treatment installations .
the W@@ aste Framework Directive applies to all waste streams ( with the notable exception of nuclear waste and some other specific waste stream@@ s@@ 10 ) .
it establishes the so @@@ -@@ @ called waste hierarchy , sets out rules for waste management planning , qualified waste collection and treatment and calls for obligatory permitting procedures for waste treatment plants .
the W@@ F@@ D left the Member States two year to adhere to the requirements laid out by the Directive .
one of the basic schemes of the W@@ F@@ D is the so @@@ -@@ @ called waste hierarchy ( see Ar@@ t. 3 W@@ F@@ D ) .
the primary aim of European W@@ aste policy is the prevention and reduction of waste production and its harm@@ fulness .
this could be achieved by employing clean technologies that conserve the use of natural resources , by an environmentally friendly product design and by appropriate techniques for the nal disposal of dangerous substances contained in waste destined for recovery .
the proposal for an amendment to the W@@ F@@ D represents stipul@@ ations of the Th@@ ematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste , see COM ( 2005 ) 66@@ 6.@@ Like dead animal cad@@ av@@ ers , waste water , b@@ lasting agent .
the W@@ F@@ D treats these two options as equally good , in contrast to some of the waste @@@ -@@ @ stream @@@ -@@ @ specific directives , which prescri@@ be a certain minimum rate of recycling .
most importantly , this includes waste disposal in land@@ fills but also - according to the current juris@@ prudence of the European Court of J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ 11
the Member States shall , moreover , take the necessary measures to prohibit the aband@@ onment , dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste , Ar@@ t. 4 W@@ F@@ D ( 2 ) .
however , with regard to the waste hierarchy , the W@@ aste Framework Directive sets up a waste treatment philosophy that does not foresee any mechanism to effectively prevent non @@@ -@@ @ compliance .
for mixed waste , a similar legally enforc@@ eable obligation does not exist .
one policy example of the Member States in line with EU waste hierarchy is the Danish waste tax in the field of construction waste , introduced in 1987 .
a large number of EU Member States have introduced land@@ fill taxes designed to divert waste from land@@ fills to other more sophisticated waste management methods .
however , it features one of the stric@@ test waste disposal laws in the European Union .
furthermore Germany has announced the political objective to abandon municipal waste disposal in land@@ fills by the year 2020 ( goal 2020 ) .
member States are required to establish or designate the competent authority or authorities responsible for implementing the Directive .
specified tasks include drawing up waste management plans , issuing permits and inspec@@ ting installations ( Ar@@ t. 6 W@@ F@@ D ) .
the competent authorities of the Member States are required to develop one or more waste management plans ( Ar@@ t. 7 W@@ F@@ D ) .
such plans shall describe in particular :
• the natural or legal persons empowered to manage waste ; • estimated costs of recovery and disposal ; • appropriate measures to encourage ration@@ alisation of collection , sorting and treatment .
the requirements on waste management planning under the W@@ F@@ D are complemented by more specific waste management planning requirements in the Haz@@ ardous W@@ aste Directive and in the Pack@@ aging Directive .
4.@@ 1.@@ 1.4 Quali@@ fied waste collection and treatment
according to Ar@@ t. 8 of the W@@ F@@ D , Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that any holder of waste :
in general , most of the old EU Member States have a professional waste collection service , which is either run by the municipality ( public waste management services ) or by private companies commissioned with the waste collection services by the public waste authorities .
national waste law often attributes a monopoly to these public waste collection services for the collection and treatment of particular waste fr@@ actions , particularly when it comes to the disposal of household waste .
the cost of dispos@@ ing of waste must be borne by the holder who has waste handled by a collector or dispos@@ er ; and / or by the previous holder or the producer of the product from which the waste came .
the Haz@@ ardous W@@ aste Directive ( H@@ WD ) lays down specific requirements for hazardous waste ( i.e. specifically toxic , carcin@@ ogenic , etc . - waste normally originating from industry ) .
it contains criteria for the elaboration of a hazardous waste list / waste catalogue , establishes a mixing ban and requires hazardous waste management plan@@ n@@ ing.@@ 15
the H@@ WD does not include an enum@@ eration of hazardous waste streams but em@@ powers the European Commission to develop a hazardous waste list .
4.@@ 1.@@ 2.2 Identi@@ fication of hazardous waste discharge sites
member States shall take the necessary measures to require that on every site where tipping ( discharge ) of hazardous waste takes place the waste is recorded and identified ( Ar@@ t. 2 ( 1 ) H@@ WD )
Ar@@ t. 2 ( 2 ) of the H@@ WD lays down a mixing ban for specific H@@ W streams with other H@@ W streams as well as with non @@@ -@@ @ hazardous waste .
these hazardous waste management plans can be merged with the waste management plans for non @@@ -@@ @ hazardous waste ( according to Ar@@ t. 5 of the W@@ F@@ D ) .
the controls on@@ Trans@@ frontier Shi@@ p@@ ments of W@@ aste ( T@@ FS ) aim to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and for human health .
they also aim to prevent the unauthorised disposal of international waste shipments and the unregulated recovery of hazardous wastes , without hin@@ dering the legitimate trade of waste .
this guide C@@ AN@@ NOT describe all the provisions of the W@@ SR in detail but concentrates on the fundamental principles .
the author@@ isation can be refused based on the reasons for objections to waste shipments laid out in Ar@@ t. 11 .
this reason constitutes a very " general " reason to oppose shipment of waste for disposal based on which virtually every shipment of waste destined for disposal can be refused .
the export of waste destined for disposal out of EU territory is forbidden ( exception : EF@@ TA states which are also parties to the Basel Convention under certain circumstances ) , see Ar@@ t. 34 W@@ SR .
waste listed in the " Am@@ ber List " and destined for recovery principally follows the rules of waste for disposal .
the reasons for objections against the shipment of this kind of waste are , however , en@@ listed in Ar@@ t. 12 .
the transboundary shipment of waste listed in the green list and destined for recovery need not be notified to nor authorised by the authorities .
only a few administrative information requirements apply ( see in detail Ar@@ t. 18 ) .
these directives concern the following waste streams :
all of these Direc@@ tives reflect the waste management hierarchy designed by the W@@ aste Framework Directive by giving priority to the prevention / reduction of the specific waste and as a second @@@ -@@ @ best option the recycling or recovery .
another common feature of the directives cited above is that the waste streams addressed by these directives are supposed to be treated separately and that specific recycling and recovery targets are prescribed .
4.@@ 2.1 Directive on Pack@@ aging W@@ aste
the specific waste stream of packaging waste is subject to the Directive on Pack@@ aging W@@ aste ( P@@ WD )
reduction : member States shall first of all ensure that packaging waste is reduced ( e.g. by limiting the packaging of consumer goods ) .
member States may encourage reuse systems of such packaging that can be re@@ used in an environmentally sound manner ( Ar@@ t. 5 P@@ WD )
European Parliament and Council Directive 94 / 62 / EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste , Official Journal L. 365 , 31 / 12 / 1994 , p . 00@@ 10 @@@ -@@ @ 00@@ 23 .
the recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste are as follows :
Germany and Austria have passed Pack@@ aging W@@ aste ordin@@ ances and have established privately run and privately financed packaging recycling organisations .
the costs for the recovery / recycling of the packaging waste are included in the price for the respective consumer good , which is lab@@ elled " Gr@@ ü@@ ner Pun@@ kt " ( Green Point ) .
since this deposit was introduced , the waste stream of beverage cans has all but disappeared in German@@ y.@@ 22
in the UK , businesses have a choice of how to comply with the requirements of the P@@ WD .
they can either do everything themselves and purchase evidence of compliance to show they have met their obligations ; or they can join a registered compliance scheme .
a scheme takes on the legal recycling obligations for a business and carries them out for it .
scope : the EL@@ V Directive deals with " waste cars , " which are defined in Article 2 No. 1 and 2 ( cars of M@@ 1 and N1 category ) .
these bans will not be described in this guide .
the two basic innovations of the EL@@ V Directive are :
all EL@@ Vs shall be transferred to authorised treatment facilities .
member States that do not have a de @@@ -@@ @ registration system must otherwise ensure that the authorities are notified about the EL@@ V reaching a treatment facility .
within the same time limit the reuse and recycling shall be increased to a minimum of 80 % by an average per vehicle and year .
these targets increase to 95 % and 85 % respectively by 1 January 2015 .
the Directive requires Member State to create systems allowing nal holders and distributors to return WE@@ EE free of charge .
the WE@@ EE Directive prescri@@ bes four kilograms on average per inhabit@@ ant per year of WE@@ EE from private households as a minimum rate of separate collection ( Ar@@ t. 5 No. 5 WE@@ EE ) .
this mandatory target shall be revised in 2008 .
the treatment shall at a minimum include the removal of all u@@ ids .
the Directive fixes also specific recycling and recovery targets , which vary among the specific categories of equipment .
large Hou@@ se@@ hold Appl@@ i@@ ances Automatic dispen@@ sers
T@@ RE@@ AT@@ MEN@@ T@@ To guarantee environmentally sound treatment of the separately collected WE@@ EE , the WE@@ EE Directive lays down treatment requirements in Annex II for specific materials and components of WE@@ EE and Annex III lays down requirements for the treatment and storage sites .
Directive 2002 / 96 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WE@@ EE ) .
the waste management plan must include at least the following :
inspections , REC@@ OR@@ DS AND RE@@ P@@ OR@@ TS : the competent authority must inspect waste facilities at regular intervals , including after their closure .
operators are required to keep up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date records of all waste management operations and to make them available for inspection by the competent authority .
member States must ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities , including abandoned waste facilities , located in their territory is drawn up and periodically updated .
le@@ ach@@ ate means any liquid per@@ col@@ ating through the deposited waste , including polluted drainage .
rules for specific waste treatment modes
the Direc@@ tives on specific waste treatment modes lay down minimum requirements for the sound treatment of certain types of waste .
the land@@ fill Directive intends to promote compliance with the waste hierarchy in that it bans certain waste streams from being put to land@@ fills .
in this sense it limits the options for waste disposal on land@@ l@@ ls .
Ar@@ t. 5 ( 2 ) sets the following targets :
one of the main purposes and benefits of the reduction of bio@@ degrad@@ able waste from land@@ fill is to reduce the methane emissions , an important cause of the greenhouse effect and far more harmful to the climate than CO
the land@@ fill Directive , moreover , bans a series of specific waste streams from land@@ fills ( see Ar@@ t. 5 ( 3 ) .
in Ar@@ t. 6 lit@@ . a . ) the land@@ fill Directive stipulates that only waste that has been subject to treatment may be land@@ filled ( except for in@@ ert waste ) .
the treatment should reduce the quantity of the waste or the hazards to human health and the environment .
scope : the W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive lays down emission limit values for installations that inc@@ iner@@ ate or co @@@ -@@ @ inc@@ iner@@ ate waste .
the Directive lists further requirements for the permits to be issued ( e.g. compliance with measurement standards as laid down in Annex III , concrete outlook which quantity of waste streams may be incin@@ erated , etc . ) .
moreover , the Directive stipulates requirements for the incin@@ eration process ( minimum temperature for hazardous and non @@@ -@@ @ hazardous waste , gas treatment , etc . ) .
the Directive lays down minimum emission limit values for exhaust and wastewater for waste inc@@ iner@@ ators and co @@@ -@@ @ incin@@ eration plants .
5 Current situation with respect to Policy Sector
the following section describes the current situation with respect to waste management of the EN@@ P partners .
EU 's Eastern EN@@ P partners and Russia
the waste sector in most European neighbouring countries and Russia has been subject to a transformation process .
in the EN@@ P Action Plans of these countries , the adoption of legislation and planning for waste management as a key environmental concern are one of the primary objectives ( see EN@@ P Action Plans for Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Moldova , Ukraine ) .
the following environmental pressures are common :
• No widespread reduction or recovery policy for waste ; • uncontrolled waste dumping ; • No sound treatment of hazardous waste ; • Problems with illegal transboundary movement of waste ; • Il@@ legal imports of hazardous waste .
principally , the Mediterranean Partners face similar challenges as the East @@@ -@@ @ European neighbouring Countries and Russia to which can be added :
• Frequ@@ ent absence of sound waste management services ; • Ex@@ ist@@ ence of an " In@@ formal " recycling sec@@ tor@@ 29 .
this implies informal " workers " who search waste b@@ ins for valuable materials and sell these materials to intermedi@@ ates or small companies , which " recover " these materials .
the activities of these informal " workers , " who often operate secretly on ground that is not theirs , is often not approved by the state and private households , nor does it comply with hygienic standards .
6 Implementation Con@@ si@@ der@@ ations for EN@@ P Partners and Russia
from the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 , the EU is providing financial support for the EN@@ P through a dedicated European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
there are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the EN@@ PI countries can benefit .
this includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy .
in real terms it means as increase of 32 % as compared with the previous financial framework .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
it can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate .
depending on the status quo ( " starting point " ) of each country , a step @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ step approach could be suitable to improve the environmental quality of waste management .
waste Management as a Mat@@ ter of Public Interest
waste authorities then have to develop a waste policy consisting of basic strategic choices and technical day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day management of the waste streams in the state .
in order to prepare and control the proper management of waste , these authorities have to acquire an overview of the quantities and qualities of the wastes produced in the states and have to devise options for waste collections and treatment .
to gain such an overview , waste management planning has to be employed .
the plan would include an overview of waste flows and existing " official " waste treatment sites .
such a " status @@@ -@@ @ quo " plan would be the basis for the development and / or improvement of a waste policy , including strategic choices such as the future method of waste collection / treatment of waste .
depending on the status quo of the countries , the waste authorities would need to identify priority areas of action addressing the most urgent waste @@@ -@@ @ related problems .
chapters 6.2 @@@ -@@ @ 6.5 give an overview of the most common problems and how they could be addressed with help of drawing on the EU waste legislation .
6.@@ 1.2 Installation of a waste collection service and fines against lit@@ tering
one of the basic reasons for insufficient waste management resulting in waste in the streets ( " lit@@ tering " ) are :
• Ab@@ s@@ ence of an effective waste collection service ; • High prices for waste collection ; • L@@ ack of awareness of a proper environment .
for these reasons , the reduction of lit@@ tering must be a priority for those countries where garbage on the street is widespread .
a fundamental requirement for ecologically sound and socially acceptable waste management is the professional collection and treatment of waste produced in a local community to be organised by the public author@@ iti@@ es.@@ 31
in turn , any " informal " waste recycling , e.g. extraction of valuable goods from land@@ fills or public / private waste b@@ ins by non @@@ -@@ @ authorised persons should be suppressed .
the exclusive assignment of waste management activities to competent public waste management services or private waste management firms should guarantee that waste is collected in a professional manner .
in addition , all waste treatment , including recycling , should be carried out in installations that have been permitted to ensure compliance with legally established environmental and health standards .
the actual operative collection can be carried out either by public services or private firms commissioned by the waste authorities .
6.@@ 2.1 Land@@ l@@ ls in the waste management plans
the existence of uncontrolled land@@ fills has been identified as a core problem for most of the Eastern European and Mediterranean neighbours as well as Russia .
in order to improve this situation , waste authorities would first need to inventory existing uncontrolled land@@ fills , categor@@ ising them according to their potential impact to the environment .
the waste authorities then would need to push for the gradual closure of the uncontrolled land@@ fills with a high risk to human health and the environment .
over a transition period and to taking account of economic realities in the respective states , in@@ ert waste could be put on these land@@ fills preparing their closure .
the requirements of the Land@@ ll Directive and the Decision on W@@ aste Acc@@ ept@@ ance C@@ rit@@ eria could serve as guidelines for a land@@ fill management plan .
this shift would require a substantial investment into infrastructure , as well as trained personnel to inspect the land@@ fill sites and to ensure compliance of these land@@ fills with all standards .
this all contributes to a sharp rise of the costs of land@@ f@@ ill@@ ing@@ . l@@ ling .
6.@@ 2.2 Land@@ l@@ ls for hazardous waste
it is , moreover , of paramount importance to ban hazardous wastes from standard household waste land@@ - fills and construct land@@ fills exclusively for hazardous waste .
the requirements of the Land@@ ll Directive , which stipulates different land@@ fill Cl@@ asses including Class III for hazardous waste , can serve as a guid@@ eline for the construction and operation of such hazardous waste land@@ f@@ ill@@ s. LL@@ S .
furthermore , the development of hazardous waste management plans as stipulated in the Haz@@ ardous W@@ aste Directive , which could be part of general waste management plan , is recommended .
exclusion of certain waste streams from " legal " land@@ l@@ ls
the exclusion of certain waste streams from land@@ fill can concern waste streams that are
• suitable for recycling or energetic recovery and / or • responsible for the lion 's share of greenhouse gas emissions from land@@ fills , such as organic waste .
it is of primary importance that the products of any recycling and recovery processes can be marketed and thus can contribute to a lowering of waste management costs .
therefore , policy makers should promote secondary product and energy from waste @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ energy installations to assure that they can be sold and used .
thus , public campaigns and public procurement should raise awareness of waste as a resource .
6.@@ 3.1 Promotion of recovery and recycling of certain waste streams
even if the operation of officially permitted land@@ fill is preferable to unregulated waste dumping , waste disposal in land@@ fills is still considered the least environmentally sound way of waste " treatment . "
resources contained in the different waste streams are lost by " bur@@ ying " them in land@@ fills , often becoming polluted sites after their closure .
thus , the recycling and recovery of waste is largely preferable to waste disposal in land@@ fills , as established in the W@@ aste Hier@@ archy of the W@@ aste Framework Directive ( see Ar@@ t. 3 W@@ F@@ D ) .
the promotion of waste recycling and energy recovery serves the following aims :
• Use of waste as a resource and production of secondary materials and energy ; • Lim@@ itation of territories needed as land@@ fill and reduction of polluted sites .
a secondary effect of extensive recycling and recovery is also the creation of jobs , as even official land@@ fills require fewer employers than recycling or waste @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ energy installations .
6.@@ 3.2 Ban of organic waste from land@@ l@@ ls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
promote controls of waste shipments in accordance with the Basel Convention
this Convention was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the 116 States participating in the Conference of Pl@@ enipot@@ enti@@ aries on the Global Convention on the Control of Trans@@ boundary Mov@@ ements of Haz@@ ardous W@@ astes .
an effective implementation of the requirements of the Basel Convention by the EN@@ P would very much help limit the un@@ desired imports of hazardous and other wastes into the Eastern and Mediterranean Partners as well as Russia .
flexible Instr@@ uments to achieve the diversion of waste streams from land@@ l@@ ls to other treatments
a variety of instruments exist to achieve a reduction of waste disposed in land@@ fills .
basically , land@@ fills are considered to be the lowest level of waste disposal .
one example is the land@@ fill tax , currently imposed only on national level without any EU @@@ -@@ @ related obligations .
the land@@ fill tax is intended to reduce the overall masses of waste destined for land@@ fills via price mechanisms .
another option , which can be described as a mixture between command @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ control and economic incentives , are producer responsibility measures ( such as the Pack@@ aging W@@ aste Directive , the EL@@ V Directive or the WE@@ EE Directive ) .
these measures obli@@ ge the producers , importers and retailers to achieve certain collection and reuse / recycling / recovery targets for specific waste streams .
still , these measures do not prohibit completely the disposal of certain parts of these waste streams in land@@ fills , but stipul@@ ate legally binding minimum rates of recovery and recycling of these waste streams .
the producers , retailers and importers of the different goods are free in their choice of instruments to achieve this aim .
EN@@ P Partners and Russia could considerably benefit from the adoption of some of the principles outlined in the European W@@ aste Law .
to this end , there is often a need for EN@@ P to develop or renew :
• national waste management policy and waste management plans ; • waste framework legislation ; • sustainable waste management systems ; • waste classification and inventory systems .
apart from these aspects ( indispensable for a sustainable waste management system ) , further challenges to convergence lie in the costs that an advanced waste management system triggers .
not only are additional administrative and operational personnel needed to guarantee a solid waste management service , but advanced technology has to be applied as well .
solid waste treatment of residual waste can increase costs for citizens .
exact costs and prices C@@ AN@@ NOT be given in this guide ; however , some estim@@ ations can be given .
the highly cal@@ ori@@ fic waste separated in M@@ BT ( about 20 @@@ -@@ @ 30 % of the input ) can be co @@@ -@@ @ incin@@ erated in an industrial plant ( cement mill , power station ) .
thus , the sum of costs for the treatment for 1 ton of waste can be estimated at 80 @@@ -@@ @ 140 Euro .
the thermal treatment of residual waste in a waste incin@@ eration installation that complies with the W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive can be priced between 100 and 140 Euro / ton on aver@@ ag@@ e.@@ 35
many elements of the EU waste legislation are apt to improve the waste management situation in the Eastern and Mediterranean neighbouring Countries and Russia .
it is obvious that it is neither realistic nor necessary to apply all EU waste legislation at once in the region of Eastern and Mediterranean Countries and Russia .
those countries that do not yet feature a depend@@ able public waste management system should start o with implementing the basic requirements of a sound general waste management planning and the enforcement of these plans .

5.1 EU 's Eastern EN@@ P Partner Countries and Russia
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was created in 2003 / 2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries .
it is a collective EU response to the aspirations of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity , stability and security in our region .
the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
the political , economic , social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East @@@ -@@ @ Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and the Southern Caucasus , and to the South , in the Mediterranean region , are wor@@ ry@@ ingly large and in certain cases increasing .
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy represents a new approach in the EU 's relations with its neighbours .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 1 .
it goes beyond classical co @@@ -@@ @ operation : it consists of intensified political dialogue and deeper economic relations , based on shared values and common interest in tackling common problems .
the EN@@ P is not about membership of the EU - if an accession perspective were to be offered at some point in the future to any of the countries covered by the EN@@ P , this would be a separate process .
the necessary legal and institutional framework for intensified cooperation with EN@@ P partners are Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements or Association Agre@@ ements .
the tools , however , to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed , tailor @@@ -@@ @ made EN@@ P Action Pl@@ ans@@ 2 with short and medium term priorities ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years ) .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
the Commission has set up a web @@@ -@@ @ site explaining the EN@@ P and its processes and containing key EN@@ P documents such as the Strategy P@@ apers , the Action Plans and Progress Reports .
please refer to : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / world / EN@@ P / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m.
EN@@ P partner countries are expected to benefit considerably from full implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including from enhanced convergence with the EU approaches .
for benefits resulting from enhanced environment protection , including convergence , please refer to Chapter 3 .
in order to help partner countries to realise these benefits , the European Commission has decided to provide information on EU environment policy and legislation in key policy areas .
climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU 's environmental cooperation with partner countries , which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address .
the purpose of this policy guide on air is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioriti@@ s@@ ation and sequ@@ encing of activities .
the guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environment policy and legislation can assist the EN@@ P partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
this includes summar@@ ising the main provisions of the legislation .
the guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean EN@@ P partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence .
finally , it identifies useful steps to be taken to promote convergence .
since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably , the guides take a general approach and references to specific countries are not made .
the relevance of full or partial convergence is also to be seen in this light .

the problems that this policy aims to address
3 Ex@@ p@@ ected Benef@@ its of Conver@@ gence
convergence toward EU air quality legislation has the potential to bring a number of benefits to the EU 's European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) partner countries .
the adoption of the approaches found in the EU legislation may contribute to more sustainable air quality management and to the reduction of ambient air pollution .
convergence of the Air Quality Framework Directive , its Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives and the new Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe of 2008 could serve as a model for the EN@@ P partner countries for the assessment and management of ambient air quality .
the z@@ oning approach established in the Air Quality Framework Directive could help save human and financial resources .
the daughter directives set air quality standards for the protection of human health , ecosystems and vegetation .
the standards are particularly relevant as countries could avoid new or continued damage to human health and sensitive ecosystems .
the Direc@@ tives also define a framework for taking the ab@@ at@@ ement action where needed .
in this respect , the adoption of EU air quality standards would be a step toward the reform of the requirements for permits for industrial installations ( as required by the IP@@ PC directive , see the Policy Guide on IP@@ PC Directive for more information ) .
the provisions of the Exchange of Information Decision are highly relevant for public information regarding the ambient air quality situation , and for the preparation of effective air pollution ab@@ at@@ ement plans and programmes .
in the EU , this piece of legislation ensures a collection of baseline data on ambient air quality and an improvement in their compatibility , compar@@ ability and transparency .
emissions of aci@@ di@@ fying and eut@@ roph@@ ying substances and ozone precur@@ sors are a significant problem , particularly in large cities of the EU 's Eastern EN@@ P Partner Countries and in Russia .
convergence with this Directive is attractive due to the Directive 's flexibility concerning which measures must be taken in order to comply with national emissions ceilings .
this flexibility allows for the simultaneous pursu@@ ance of national priorities and the management of major air pollution problems .
the Directive on E@@ missions from Light @@@ -@@ @ duty Vehic@@ les and the Directive Rel@@ ating to the Quality of Petro@@ l and Di@@ esel Fuel are highly relevant for the control of emissions from mobile sources .
this is of particular importance in the EU 's Eastern EN@@ P Partner Countries and Russia , where a large and increasing number of old cars are used .
box 1 : effectiveness of European air quality policies and measures in EU Member States
the survey conducted in 2004 on the effectiveness of European air quality policies and measures indicated the positive impacts of these policies .
most respondents believe that EU legislation has had a significant impact on improving air quality , inter alia by reducing emissions and their effects in all EU Member States .
all types of measures applied by EU air quality legislation were designated as effective and cost @@@ -@@ @ e ective .
the Air Quality Framework Directive and in particular its first and third Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives were indicated as very important for controlling
it was also acknowledged that the whole procedure of harmon@@ isation was very useful and that without the EU legislation it would have taken a long time to develop and implement similar legislation in these countries .

4 Overview of EU Air Policy
the European Union policy on air quality aims to develop and implement appropriate instruments to improve air quality .
following its communication on cafe Programme , the Commission has examined whether current legislation is sufficient to achieve the 6th E@@ AP objectives by 2020 .
this analysis looked at future emissions and impacts on health and the environment and has used the best available scientific and health information .
it showed that significant negative impacts will persist even with effective implementation of current legislation .
thereby the cafe programme supported the development and implementation of the Th@@ ematic Strategy on Air Poll@@ ution ( 2005 ) .
accordingly , the Th@@ ematic Strategy on Air Poll@@ ution establishes interim objectives for air pollution in the EU and proposes appropriate measures for achieving them .
it recommends that current legislation be modern@@ ised , be better focused on the most serious pollutants and that more is done to integrate environmental concerns into other policies and programmes .
both documents build on the experience gained from the current legislation and form the framework for the new EU legislation on air , which is to come into effect in 2008 .
the European Union air @@@ -@@ @ quality policy actions focus on :
establishing minimum quality standards for ambient air ; 2 .
tackling the problems of acid rain and ground level ozone ; 3 .
controlling emissions from stationary and mobile sources ; 4 .
promoting and integrating environmental protection requirements into the transport and energy sectors ; and@@ 6 .
on the basis of the EU air quality policy actions , 10 directives were selected for further review .
they are grouped into 5 areas representing ( see Box 2 below ) : the central legislation on ambient air quality assessment and management with its daughter directives , the national emission ceiling directive and the directives addressing emissions form stationary and mobile sources .
there is also another EU legislation of particular importance to air quality improvement , e.g. IP@@ PC Directive , W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive , VO@@ C Sol@@ -
box 2 : selected directives in the air @@@ -@@ @ quality policy sector

emissions standards for stationary sources : Directive 2001 / 80 / EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants ( the L@@ CP Directive ) .
the selected directives are described in detail in Chap@@ ters 4.2 @@@ -@@ @ 4.6 below .
the directives are presented , focusing on the aim of a directive , its main principles and instruments as well as the benefits seen from the implementation of the directive .
over@@ arch@@ ing Principles of Air Quality Management in the EU
the European Community air quality legislation design@@ ates a number of over@@ arch@@ ing principles for current air quality management ( see Table 1 ) .
in contrast , the directives that set emissions standards and limit values for products ( e.g. in fuel ) are based on " technologically and economically feasible standards . "
an integrated approach means that measures taken to reduce air pollution at one point or in one area should not lead to an increase in air pollution elsewhere , or to an increase in pollution of another environmental medium .

the potential pollu@@ ter should in general bear the costs of pollution prevention and control measures as well as remedi@@ ation .
in the context of air quality management , this means that potential em@@ it@@ ters of air pollutants should bear the full costs of carrying out their activities in an environmentally sound manner i.e. taking air quality ( and other issues ) into account .
in particular the National E@@ mission Ce@@ il@@ ings Directive .
under the National E@@ mission Ce@@ il@@ ings Directive the emission ceilings for the Member States are based on the principle of achieving the environmental objectives though cost @@@ -@@ @ effective measures , i.e. at the least cost for the European Community .
in particular directives regul@@ at@@ ing@@ emissions from stationary sources and@@ setting national emission ceilings .
international approach .
firstly , Member States are not expected to achieve independently satisfactory air quality with respect to pollutants originating outside their territory .
secondly , Member States are required to take into account the effects of their own emissions on other countries even when those emissions have no significant adverse effects within their own frontiers .
member States with a common border are expected to consult each other , when necessary , regarding air quality .
communication and information .
member States are required to inform the Commission about air quality issues in their territory and ( in more recent legislation ) to inform the public .
member States are required to provide up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date information to the public and appropriate organisations on ambient air concentrations of certain pollutants .
plans or programmes setting out pollution ab@@ at@@ ement measures for the zones or ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations concerned must also be made available to the public .

ambient air quality assessment and management and standards
4.@@ 2.1 The Air Quality Framework Directive 96 / 62 / EC and its Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives
the Air Quality Framework Directive and the four Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives define the legislative basis for assessment and management of air quality in Member States .
the Framework Directive gives general requirements and the Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives specify the requirements for the various pollutants in more detail .
an important goal of the directives is that air quality be assessed and managed in a comparable way and on the basis of the same criteria in all Member States .

• The fourth Dau@@ ghter Directive 2004 / 107 / EC relating to arsen@@ ic , cad@@ mium , mercury , nickel and poly@@ cy@@ c@@ lic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air .
objectives for Am@@ bi@@ ent Air Quality
the third Dau@@ ghter Directive aims to protect human health and vegetation and sets long term objectives .
member States may set more stringent standards than those laid out by the Direc@@ tives as well as regulate other pollutants not covered by those Direc@@ tives .
box 3 : definitions of standards in the Framework Directive and its Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives
the Air Quality Framework Directive requires Member States to carry out a preliminary assessment of ambient air quality throughout their territories in order to obtain initial data on the levels of specified pollutants in the air .
to this end , the methods and criteria set out in the Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives may be used or methods for which Member States can demonstrate that they give equivalent results .
member States have to prepare a list of zones and ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations which is to be reviewed at least every five years .
member States shall determine the assessment requirements in individual zones ( see Box 4 ) and design measurement network in each zone depending on the level of the pollutants .
zones or ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations are primary units for air quality management .
box 4 : definitions for zones and ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations introduced by the Air Quality Framework Directive
in zones where the level of more than one pollut@@ ant is higher than the limit values , Member States shall provide an integrated plan covering all the pollutants concerned .
member States shall prepare action plans indicating the measures to be taken in the short term to reduce pollution , in the event there is a risk of the limit values and / or alert thresholds being exceeded .
in zones where levels of pollutants are lower than air quality limit values , Member States have to maintain or improve those levels .
information on Am@@ bi@@ ent Air Quality
plans or programmes setting out the relevant pollution ab@@ at@@ ement measures must also be made available to the public .
4.@@ 2.2 Exchange of Information Decision ( 97 / 101 / EC )
with the Exchange of Information Decision ( 97 / 101 / EC ) the European Union has established a Comm@@ u @@@ -@@ @ nity @@@ -@@ @ wide procedure for exchanging information and data on ambient air quality in the EU .
the information exchange relates to the pollutants listed in Annex I of the Air Quality Framework Directive and to other poll@@ uting substances ( see Annex I of the Decision ) .
exchange includes information on the :
• structure and organisation of the network to which they belong ( e.g. geographical extent and organisation of the network ) .
national emission ceilings
4.@@ 3.1 The National E@@ mission Ce@@ il@@ ings Directive 2001 / 81 / EC
the National E@@ mission Ce@@ il@@ ings ( NE@@ C ) Directive aims to limit emissions of aci@@ di@@ fying and eut@@ roph@@ ying pollutants and ozone precur@@ sors in order to improve the protection of human health and the environment and to achieve the prescribed ambient air quality standards .
X measures to comply with the national emission ceilings .
however , the Directive leaves it largely to Member States to decide which measures to take .
this Directive covers emissions in the territory of Member States from all sources of pollutants which arise as a result of human activities , except for emissions from international maritime traffic and the emissions beyond take o and landing cycles of aircraft .
the pollutants concerned in the NE@@ C Directive are transported in large quantities across national boundaries .
due to the transboundary character of aci@@ di@@ fication and ozone pollution , co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ated Community action is required since individual action by Member States is not sufficient to tackle the problem .
update annually their national emission inventories and emission projections for 2010 with the use of EM@@ EP / Cor@@ in@@ air E@@ mission Invent@@ ory Gu@@ ide@@ book@@ .The inventories shall be prepared using methodologies agreed upon by the L@@ RT@@ AP Convention .
draw up a national programme for the progressive reduction of the national emissions in order to demonstrate how they are going to meet the national emission ceilings by 2010 .
a national programme shall include information regarding adopted and planned policies and measures , and quanti@@ fied estimates of their effects on the emissions in 2010 .
the first national programmes have been drawn in 2002 .
the second national programmes - by the end of 2006 . ( examples of the measures taken by Member States under the NE@@ C Directive are provided in Box 5 ) .
box 5 : measures indicated in the National Program@@ mes of the NE@@ C Directive
EU Direc@@ tives that directly or indirectly ab@@ ate the NE@@ C Directive pollutants - VO@@ Cs , NO@@ x
- represent a significant proportion of the policies and measures implemented by Member States .
the IP@@ PC Directive is important to achieve the NE@@ C Directive 's ceil@@ - ings as it addresses all four pollutants .
the EU 's 1999 solv@@ ents directive is the most commonly reported directive as a key VO@@ C measure .
another key directive influencing the NE@@ C Directive is the L@@ CP Direc@@ - tive , reported by Member States as a measure for reducing NO and SO

the NE@@ C Directive is used as the EU instrument for the implementation of the " multi @@@ -@@ @ pollut@@ ant " protocol under the L@@ RT@@ AP Convention , the so @@@ -@@ @ called 1999 Go@@ th@@ enburg Protocol .
the European Community and its Member States have all signed the Protocol .
many but not yet all EU Member States together with Switzerland , Norway and the United States are the parties to this Protocol .
the emission ceilings in the protocol are equal or less ambitious than those in the NE@@ C Directive .
in 2007 , the review of the Go@@ th@@ enburg Protocol was performed .
the review concludes that in the last 25 years , air pollution in Europe has been substantially reduced ; however , current reduction plans are insufficient to fully protect human health and ecosystems .
emissions standards for stationary sources
4.@@ 4.1 The Large Com@@ bus@@ tion Pl@@ ants Directive 2001 / 80 / EC
the Large Com@@ bus@@ tion Pl@@ ants ( L@@ CP ) Directive aims to gradually reduce the annual emissions of SO@@ 2 and NO@@ X@@ from existing plants and sets emission limit values for SO@@ 2 , NO@@ x and dust for both existing and new plants . control of SO
the L@@ CP Directive applies to large combustion plants with a thermal input of 50 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts ( MW ) or more , irrespective of the type of fuel that is used .
the directive regards large combustion plants as falling into one of three categories depending on when they where first licensed :
, NO@@ x tightened the Community requirements for air pollution control for " new " combustion plants ; and established new requirements for " existing " plants licensed before 1 July 1987 .
the Directive oblig@@ es Member States to take appropriate measures to meet the emission limit values for " new " and " new @@@ -@@ @ new " plants as laid down in part A and B accordingly of Ann@@ exes III to VII .
in regard to the " existing plants , " the L@@ CP Directive gives Member States two options to comply .
the first requires each plant to comply with specified emission limit values for SO
X second allows a national emission reduction plan to be implemented .
, NO and dust to the levels that would have been achieved by applying the emis@@ -
X sion limit values to the existing plants in operation in the year 2000 , on the basis of each plant 's operational performance averaged over the last five years of operation up to and including 2000 .
the implementation of a national emission reduction plan has to take into account obligations under other Community legislation , notably the IP@@ PC Directive , the NE@@ C Directive , and the Air Quality Framework Directive .
box 6 : examples of instruments used to reduce emissions in selected Member States
several countries ( e.g. Austria and the Netherlands ) used voluntary agreements ( contracts ) with industry and found them to be very e ective .
before this legislation , heavy oil and coal were used for heating and power plants ; after

emissions standards for mobile sources
4.@@ 5.1 Direc@@ tives on E@@ mission from Light @@@ -@@ @ duty Vehic@@ les
the pollut@@ ant emissions from road vehicles are regulated separately for light @@@ -@@ @ duty vehicles ( cars and light v@@ ans ) and for heav@@ y@@ duty vehicles ( trucks and buses ) .
for light @@@ -@@ @ duty vehicles , the emission standard currently in force is Euro 4 , as defined by Directive 98 / 69 / EC , which is one of the Direc@@ tives am@@ ending Directive 70 / 220 / E@@ EC .
the main effect of Euro 5 is to reduce the emission of particul@@ ate matter from diesel cars from 25 mg / km to 5 mg / km .
with respect to NO@@ x , diesel cars have until 2014 to comply with the new standards ( Euro 6 ) .
euro 6 will mainly reduce the emissions of NO@@ x from diesel cars further , from 180 mg / km to 80 mg / km .
for vehicles in use there is legislation on periodic inspections at which the state of maintenance of the vehicle is checked ( Directive 96 / 96 / EC ) .
motor vehicle emissions have originally been regulated by Directive 70 / 220 / E@@ EC ( light @@@ -@@ @ duty vehicles ) and 88 / 77 / EC ( heavy @@@ -@@ @ duty vehicles ) and amendments to those directives .
the Auto @@@ -@@ @ Oil Programme focused on the emissions of
European Union emission standards for passenger cars are summar@@ ised in Table 2 .
member States were given the right to introduce tax incentives for early introduction of 2005 - compliant vehicles , i.e. which " comply in advance with the mandatory limit values . "
member States may also apply tax incentives for vehicles fulfilling more stringent standards , which satisfy at the same time the limit values of the Directive .

4.@@ 5.2 The Directive Rel@@ ating to the Quality of Petro@@ l and Di@@ esel Fu@@ els ( 98 / 70 / EC )
the proposed changes to Directive 98 / 70 / EC underscore the Commission 's commitment to ensure that the EU comb@@ ats climate change and air pollution effectively .
the new standards will not only make petrol , diesel and gas@@ oil " cleaner " but will also allow the introduction of vehicles and machinery that poll@@ ute less .
this will cut emissions by a cumulative total of 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2020 .
a new petrol blend will be established allowing higher content of the bio @@@ -@@ @ fuel ethanol , and sulphur levels in diesel and gas@@ oil will be cut to reduce emissions of dangerous dust particles .
these substances are particularly important from a health and environmental point of view .
since 1 January 2005 the limit on the sulphur content of petrol and diesel is 50 pp@@ m and Member States are required to start ph@@ asing in ultra @@@ -@@ @ low sulphur fuel with maximum 10 pp@@ m sulphur content .
a complete switch to ultra @@@ -@@ @ low sulphur fuel with a maximum 10 pp@@ m is required by 2009 .
since 1 January 2002 all petrol sold in the EU is un@@ lead@@ ed .
such standards have to be approved by the Commission .
in order to ensure compliance with the fuel quality standards required under this Directive , Member States should introduce monitoring systems based on common procedures for sampling and testing .
member States shall collect information on fuel quality and communicate to the Commission according to a common format .
member States must monitor compliance with the environmental requirements for fuels , using the analytical methods defined by the Directive .
further recent developments in EU air quality policy
the following are the most important recent developments in the EU air quality policy .
4.@@ 6.1 Pro@@ pos@@ al for a Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe ( COM ( 2005 ) 4@@ 47 )
this proposal accompanies the thematic strategy of the Six@@ th Environmental Action Programme on air pollution and aims , in particular , to simplify and clarify the legislation concerning air quality .
existing limit values will be maintained ; however , the new Directive will regulate human Ex@@ po@@ - sure to fine particul@@ ate matter ( PM@@ 2,@@ 5 ) , which is most hazardous to human health .
it introduces a new limit values for PM@@ 2,@@ 5 , and a requirement for compliance of the national PM@@ 2.5 average concentration from urban background locations with a PM@@ 2.5 exposure concentration obligation .
it will complement the existing limit values for PM@@ 10 and will become binding by 2015 .
the proposal also simplifies the reporting requirements by creating a basis for the introduction of an electronic reporting system .
furthermore , this proposal strengthens the requirements for planning by Member States in order to enforce compliance with the limit values .
air quality plans are required whenever limit values are not respected so that " the periods of non@@ compliance are kept as short as possible . "
in the case of exceed@@ ance of the target value for ozone , Member States must prepare a programme pursuant to the NE@@ C Directive , 2001 / 81 / EC , and if appropriate an air quality plan .
the new Directive confirms the intent under current legislation to allow the sub@@ traction , under certain conditions , of natural contributions to exceed@@ ances of limit values for given pollutants .
this may be done where Member States demonstrate that the exceed@@ ance in whole or in part is due to natural contributions .
similarly Member States may take into account as regards exceed@@ ances of PM@@ exceed@@ ance is due to winter @@@ -@@ @ san@@ ding or -@@ sal@@ ting of roads .
4.@@ 6.2 Pro@@ pos@@ al for a Directive on industrial emissions ( COM ( 2007 ) 8@@ 44 )
while industrial emissions have decreased over the past years , they continue to have a significant impact on the environment and need to be reduced further .
member States " projected air emissions will greatly exceed the 2020 targets of the Th@@ ematic Strategy on Air Poll@@ ution unless timely action is taken .
all sources of pollution need to be reduced .
based on the Commission assessments , achieving the objectives set will only be possible with the full application of Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ ques ( b@@ ats ) by industry .
in order to enhance the application of b@@ ats , amongst other objectives , a proposal for a new Directive on industrial emissions was prepared in 2007 .
by stream@@ lining industrial emissions legislation , the proposal reduces the administrative burden through combined requirements on granting permits and streamlined reporting .
it strengthens the application of b@@ ats across the EU , particularly by restricting divergence from b@@ ats to specific cases and placing greater emphasis on justi@@ fying the conditions laid down in the permits .
the proposal also ti@@ ghten@@ s minimum emission limits in certain industrial sectors across the EU - particularly for large combustion plants where progress to reduce pollution is insufficient for achieving the objectives of the Commission 's Th@@ ematic Strategy on Air Poll@@ ution .
stricter emission limit values for L@@ CP@@ s will apply from 2016 onwards .
it introduces minimum standards for environmental inspections of industrial installations and allows for more effective permit reviews , and reporting of compliance and soil protection .
incentives for the development and promotion of environment@@ all@@ y@@ friendly technologies are also included .
the proposal also extends the scope of legislation to cover other poll@@ uting activities , such as medium sized combustion plants ( between 20 and 50 MW ) , production of wood @@@ -@@ @ based panels and preservation of wood .
the proposal also clari@@ fies the scope of certain activities already covered by existing legislation , such as waste treatment and food production .
additionally , new provisions will be added and current provisions will be simplified to enhance implementation and monitoring at a national level .
5 Current Sit@@ uation with Resp@@ ect to the Air Policy Sector in EN@@ P Partner Countries and Russia
in general , the ambient air quality in these countries has improved in recent decades as a consequence of the sharp decrease in air emissions due to the dramatic fall in industrial production following the collapse of the Soviet Union .
the energy and heat generation sector is by far the biggest stationary air pollution source in many of the countries .
additionally , the rapid increase in transport , together with the general use of low quality fuels , are off@@ setting the decrease in emissions from less industrial production .
air pollution is considered most severe in large and industrial cities .
not all the EN@@ P Action Plans of the Mediterranean EN@@ P partner countries foresee protection of air quality as one of their aims and concerns .
natural air pollution specific to this region ( e.g. sand and dust storms ) may add to specific anthropo@@ genic air components .
in general , air pollution affects these countries '@@ major cities and stems from transport rather than industrial emissions .
6 Con@@ clu@@ sions for EN@@ P Partner Countries and Russia : steps Tow@@ ards Conver@@ gence
from the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 , the EU is providing financial support for the EN@@ P through a dedicated European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA ( for the Southern Mediterranean neighbours ) and T@@ AC@@ IS ( for the Eastern neighbours and the Russian Federation ) .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
there are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the EN@@ PI countries can benefit .
this includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy .
in real terms it means as increase of 32 % as compared with the previous financial framework .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
it can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate .
while convergence with EU air legislation can potentially generate large contributions to solve the air pollution problems in the EN@@ P partner countries , it will also require considerable financial , technical , administrative and institutional efforts .
it is therefore necessary to assess realistically what is achievable on the basis of the existing air quality management system and the institutional set @@@ -@@ @ up in each country .
it is recommended to involve all actors and stakeholders contributing to policy development , as well as those affected by the changes .
consultation processes should involve central government ministries , regional and local governments , representatives from industry , transport and energy sectors , NGOs and the general public .
the Air Quality Framework Directive gives significant competencies to regional and local authorities , i.e. local municipalities , communities .
• The role of regional and local government in the context of air quality management is important .
institutional reform should aim to achieve a better co @@@ -@@ @ ordination and cooperation between different authorities .
• Set convergence priorities and targets .
it should be assessed the extent to which EN@@ P partner country can realistically align its regulatory framework with the EU Direc@@ tives , and in which areas conver@@ - gence can bring the greatest ben@@ e ts .
this assessment should lead to a prioriti@@ s@@ ation of tasks that may be based on the following considerations : 1 .
the Air Quality Framework Directive should be put in place early in the implementation plan due to its significant potential impact on public health .
legislative considerations . within the air quality sector , implementation of the Air Quality Framework Directive must be given a high priority , as this provides the structure and foundation for daughter legislation .
planning should be carried out as a first priority in any areas where air quality needs to be improved , i.e. where prescribed limit values are exceeded .
develop a financing strategy
the costs of implementing convergence legislation should be estimated at an early stage , and a financing strategy should be prepared .
the development of an efficient monitoring system and the update or installation of pollution ab@@ at@@ ement techniques should be prioriti@@ sed .
in this context , it may be helpful to review existing policies for charging and pricing , and to assess whether they may be amended or new systems should be introduced , in order to raise the necessary funds .
the main costs imposed by the legislation in the air quality sector will be those incurred by :
establishing and maintaining a network of air quality monitoring stations and associated quality assurance equipment , and reporting the monitoring results .
these costs will be borne by central govern@@ ment@@ .@@ 2.
preparing emissions inventories of greenhouse gases and pollutants that significantly affect air quality .
these costs will be borne by central govern@@ ment@@ .@@ 3.
preparing plans and programmes to achieve compliance with ambient air quality limits .
these costs will be borne by central govern@@ ment@@ .@@ 4.
compliance with emission limits and technical requirements required under the directives , or by the implementation of plans and programmes designed to improve ambient air quality .
these costs will be borne by the poll@@ uters themselves ( industry , house@@ holders , motor@@ ists etc ) .
whilst the costs of 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 will be considerable , the costs of 4 will be many times higher .
financing investments will be a particular challenge , since in many cases financial resources are scarce and the balance of political priorities is not in favour of expenditure on environmental protection .
charging systems and the cost @@@ -@@ @ recovery principle inherent in EU legislation may be a way to raise funds .
such systems , however , need to be designed carefully .
the implementation may meet resistance if services that were previously cost @@@ -@@ @ free suddenly require payment .
• Using the strategic and financial planning as a basis , an implementation plan should be developed detail@@ ing the steps necessary to implement convergence according to the priorities and objectives identified in the earlier planning phases .
a timeframe with short , medium and long term actions should be established .
the implementation plan should allow all the actors and stakeholders su -@@ cient time to adjust to the changes and make the necessary investments .

the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was created in 2003 / 2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries .
it is a collective EU response to the aspirations of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity , stability and security in our region .
the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
the political , economic , social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East - Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and the Southern Caucasus , and to the South , in the Mediterranean region , are wor@@ ry@@ ingly large and in certain cases increasing .
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy represents a new approach in the EU 's relations with its neighbours .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 1 .
the necessary legal and institutional framework for intensified cooperation with EN@@ P partners are Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements or Association Agre@@ ements .
the tools , however , to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed , tailor @@@ -@@ @ made EN@@ P Action Pl@@ ans@@ 2 with short and medium term priorities ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years ) .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
in that context , it goes further than promoting sustainable development and fighting poverty to encompass , for example , considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU 's internal market .
the Commission has set up a web @@@ -@@ @ site explaining the EN@@ P and its processes and containing key EN@@ P documents such as the Strategy P@@ apers , the Action Plans and Progress Reports .
please refer to : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / world / EN@@ P / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m.
EN@@ P partner countries are expected to benefit considerably from full implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including from enhanced convergence with the EU approaches .
for benefits resulting from enhanced environment protection , including convergence , please refer to Chapter 3 .
in order to help partner countries to realise these benefits , the European Commission has decided to provide information on EU environment policy and legislation in key policy areas .
climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU 's environmental cooperation with partner countries , which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address .
the purpose of this policy guide on horizontal environmental EC legislation is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioriti@@ s@@ ation and sequ@@ encing of activities .
the guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environment policy and legislation can assist the EN@@ P partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
this includes summar@@ ising the main provisions of the legislation .
the guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean EN@@ P partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence .
finally , it identifies useful steps to be taken to promote convergence .
since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably , the guides take a general approach and references to specific countries are not made .

the problems that this policy aims to address
without access to information and participation in decision @@@ -@@ @ making , democratic decision @@@ -@@ @ making is unthinkable .
furthermore , lack of information prevents citizens from making important choices based on the given information . lack of information also h@@ inders participation in decision @@@ -@@ @ making , as only informed citizens can take action in an appropriate way .
without establishing a right to access to information , citizens do not have the possibility to claim access to that inform@@ ation@@ .@@ EN@@ P partner countries are going through a phase of economic restructuring and development .
furthermore , access to environmental information not only helps the public to get a picture of the environmental situation and may help to avoid environmentally induced diseases but also is a precondition for participation .
participation in turn allows for the public to influence decision @@@ -@@ @ making in the respective cases .
reporting on implementation of environmental legislation increases transparency and accountability .
3 Ex@@ p@@ ected Benef@@ its of Conver@@ gence
convergence to EU legislation has the potential to bring a number of benefits to EN@@ P partner countries .
by observing previous approxim@@ ation processes from accession countries , the main benefits from conver@@ ging to EU environmental legislation have been identified , such as
however , progress in the Member States has shown that compliance with these EU provisions can lead to a number of benef@@ it@@ s. ts .
access to environmental information is precondition for citizens to get a picture of their local environmental situation .
this may be the basis for decisions such as whether to move to or from a certain area .
furthermore , access to environmental information is a precondition for participation .
reporting on implementation of environmental legislation increases transparency and accountability .
as mentioned in chapter 2 , the E@@ IA and SE@@ A Direc@@ tives have contributed to improving development projects , plans and programmes significantly in the EU Member States .
seas , which provide for a systematic review of environmental issues , improve planning by clari@@ fying potentially significant environmental impacts and creating a better balance between environmental , social and economic factors , thus improving decision @@@ -@@ @ making as well .
the Directive for providing for public participation in respect of E@@ IA ( 2003 / 35 ) , enhances transparency and increase legitimacy of plans , programmes , and individual projects .
moreover , it is important to view such benefits not only with respect to changes in the overall environmental situation of a country , but also with respect to increasing a country 's position for receiving international development aid .
in particular , infrastructure investments are only likely to be granted under the condition of prior environmental assessments .
some development banks and agencies , such as the World Bank , require beneficiary countries to use similar impact assessment systems and procedures in order to receive financial aid for projects .
EN@@ P countries may face barriers to receiving development aid if their environmental impact assessment systems are deemed inadequate by the donor agency .
in both the Mediterranean and Eastern region programs have been established to guide and improve environmental policies .
in the Mediterranean region the Mediterranean Environmental Assistance Programme ( ME@@ T@@ AP ) 6 was established .
ME@@ T@@ AP 's E@@ IA project , launched in January 1999 , has brought together country representatives from various stakeholder organisations to improve the assessment system , as environmental protection is ineffective without proper legislative and administrative frameworks .
box 1 : ben@@ ets already seen in EN@@ P partner countries :
overall , recep@@ tivity towards introducing public participation has increased .
ben@@ ets of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive
in a study conducted by the European Commission in 1996 Member States were asked to evaluate the benefits seen from implementing the E@@ IA Directive .
case studies from Greece , the Netherlands , Spain and the UK indicated that the E@@ IA process had in fact positively imp@@ acted the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process@@ 7 .
the following summar@@ ises the responses these Member States gave with respect to benefits : TS :
box 2 : ben@@ ets of E@@ IA in Europe - Country Ex@@ am@@ ples
interest in building a new motorway to solve these problems resulted in an E@@ IA in order to assess different options .
an E@@ IA was required because the road passes through important natural areas , and any modification could result in significant environmental impacts .
through the examination of potential environmental impacts , the developers were able to identify their chosen design , which was to build a new motorway , and to mitigate negative environmental impacts .
since an E@@ IA was conducted , the project design was accepted with fewer reservations by stakeholders , and the plan had little opposition .
this case study is a good example of how undertaking an E@@ IA can reduce environmental impacts to an acceptable level .
the E@@ IA of Bill@@ und Airport ( Denmark ) Denmark 's Bill@@ und airport wanted to extend its capacity without increasing the noise on surrounding homes .
in order to reduce noise levels , the initial plan was to extend one of the run@@ ways nor@@ th@@ wards .
however , through the E@@ IA process , which was marked by a high level of cooperation between developers and the public , alternatives were discussed and the outcome resulted in a change of plan .
the E@@ IA concluded that the same reduction in noise levels could be achieved by modifying the airport 's take @@@ -@@ @ off procedure .
by not having to undertake any new construction , the alternative plan saved 4@@ 0.4 million € .
additionally , approximately 350 hectares of farm@@ land and forest area were preserved , and the number of homes exposed to noise was reduced from 1,@@ 2@@ 90 to 3@@ 28 .
furthermore , by identifying and choosing an alternative that does not result in additional environmental impacts , the project proposal received no complaints and the project was able to avoid delays .

sea Implementation for Vien@@ n@@ ese W@@ aste Management Plan Vienna , Austria was experiencing significant increases in the volume of waste in the city resulting in bottlenecks at treatment facilities .
in order to alleviate the growing waste problem and enhance their management plans , an SE@@ A was undertaken , with the goal of solving their problem by 2010 .
within the SE@@ A process , the Vienna City Council engaged a wide range of stakeholders to participate in their Round Table discussions , including relevant authorities , representatives of the " qualified " public and external experts .
this example shows how engaging various stakeholders and experts can lead to an efficient SE@@ A process and achieve results least harmful to the environment .
by following the SE@@ A guidelines , the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process was improved through constant evaluation .
as a result , the Vienna City Council followed the recommendations of the SE@@ A .
mid @@@ -@@ @ Wales : ben@@ ets seen from SE@@ A Implementation The M@@ id @@@ -@@ @ Wales region in@@ Wales was having difficulties with power failures due to interrup@@ tions in power supply .
in response to this issue , Scot@@ ti@@ sh@@ Power , the main supplier of electricity in the region , undertook an SE@@ A to find best possible solutions to providing a more depend@@ able electricity service .
the first step was to con@@ cre@@ tise the plan 's objectives with respect to potentially significant environmental implications , including objectives with respect to regional cultural heritage and conservation areas nearby .
in cooperation with regional agencies as well as environmental groups , the SE@@ A was able to identify three additional alternatives to the three Scot@@ ti@@ sh@@ Power had initially considered .
each of the alternatives was analysed with respect to environmental , social and economic impacts .
the plan chosen was one of the alternatives identified in the SE@@ A planning process .
by analysing every alternative , Scot@@ ti@@ sh@@ Power was able to legitim@@ ise its plan decision .
environmental stakeholders were thus satisfied with the results , making it easier to begin development .
this case study is a good example of how the analysis of alternatives can help set priorities with respect to environmental impacts .
as the alternative chosen was not one initially proposed by the company , this case study also highlights how an SE@@ A can bring innovation to plans and projects .

the horizontal sector comprises environmental legislation on subjects that cut across other environmental legislation and the environmental media such as water , air or soil .
in contrast to the media @@@ -@@ @ related legislation , the horizontal legislation is procedural in character and provides for methods and mechanisms aimed at improving decision @@@ -@@ @ making , legislative development and implementation .
horizontal EU legislation on the environment addressed in this guide comprises :
public authorities hold data and information on a wide range of environmental matters that have often been collected over long periods in order to carry out their various legal responsibilities .
the Access to Information Directive was adopted by the EU in order to implement the Aar@@ h@@ us Convention , signed on 25 June 1998 , in particular the pillar related to access to environmental information .
the European Community and 24 Member States are parties to this convention .
the aim of the Access to Information Directive is to further the goal of contributing to a greater awareness of environmental matters by
the Directive sets out to whom public authorities must make what information relating to the environment available and which public authorities are obliged to do so .
the obligation to provide access to environmental information also applies to bodies which have public responsibilities for the environment and which are under the control of public authorities .
to this end , public authorities need to ensure that lists of these bodies are available to the public .
the Directive however , also sets out , when request for information may be refused and under which conditions .
the envisaged grounds for refusal have to be interpreted in a restrictive way , taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by disclosure .
providing access to information in the sense of the Directive goes beyond the passive provision of information .
it also implies the active dissemination of environmental information related to applicable environmental laws , policies , plans , programmes , progress reports , state of the environment reports and monitoring data .
public authorities have to ensure that any information compiled by them or on their behalf is up to date , accurate and comparable .
since many Direc@@ tives set out reporting requirements on progress of their implementation , the aim of this Directive is to ration@@ alise and improve the way in which information is transmitted to the Commission .
most Direc@@ tives - with exemption of the Bath@@ ing@@ Water Directive - require reports to the Commission every three years .
although it may not seem necessary for EN@@ P partner countries to comply with the reporting Directive , convergence is expected to trigger the following benefits : TS :
the Directive requires Member States to send information to the Commission on implementation of the Direc@@ tives listed in Ann@@ exes I to VI of the Directive within specified time limits .
to this end reports the Commission provides a relevant questionnaire or outline on which the reports should be based .
since the concept of environmental impact assessments ( E@@ IA ) had first emerged in the 1970 " s , various regions in the world have introduced E@@ IA laws .
the EU adopted its Council Directive 85 / 3@@ 37 / EEC@@ 10 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment ( i.e. the EU E@@ IA Directive ) in 1985 .
the idea of environmental impact assessments is based on the precautionary principle and the principle that prevent@@ ative action should be taken ( Box 4 ) .
environmental measures to guard the environment from negative effects should be taken as early on in decision @@@ -@@ @ making as possible .
box 4 : precautionary and prevent@@ ative Action Princi@@ ple
first developed in Germany as the Vor@@ sor@@ ge@@ prin@@ zip , meaning fore@@ sight , the precautionary principle has gained international momentum since the 1970 " s .
the Commission elaborated a Communication on the precautionary principle on 2nd February 200@@ 0@@ 12 .
this Communication was supported by other Institutions .
a SE@@ A must " improve , rather than just analyse the policy , plan or programme " 13 , as well as identify and comparatively assess feasible alternatives .
in addition to the precautionary principle and public participation and consultation , the SE@@ A has also incorporated the principle of achieving sustainable development , an idea which is lacking in the E@@ IA .

box 5 : plans and Program@@ mes vs. Individual Projects
though the SE@@ A Directive does not define the terms plan or programme it provides guiding criteria .
on the other hand , individual projects refer to a concrete project within such strategy or land use plans , such as the building of an airport or the construction of a new highway .
for example , if a country prepares a national environmental action plan for spatial planning this plan needs to undertake a SE@@ A .
then , within this over@@ arch@@ ing strategy , a project to widen a specific river to make space for flooding requires an E@@ IA .
the following provides examples for plans and programmes :
management plans for the following sectors :
• water@@ telecommun@@ ic@@ ation@@ st@@ our@@ is@@ m@@ regional and town plan@@ n@@ ing@@ land use
• agriculture forestry fisheries energy transport waste
within this aim , the E@@ IA seeks to :
by identifying potential environmental aspects , the E@@ IA seeks to protect environmental resources for current and future generations .
the Directive has been amended by Directive 97 / 11 / EC .
implementation of the E@@ IA Directive has also to take into account the requirements of the Directive for providing for public participation in respect of E@@ IA [ 2003 / 35 / EC ] ( see Chapter 4.4 ) .
they are to be assessed : during the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process , before the plans or programmes are adopted , with the aim of improving the plan from a sustainable development point of view .
the stages of an SE@@ A are an integral part of the planning process .
screening : since the Directive does not give a one @@@ -@@ @ stop definition of plans and programmes , the given country first has to determine the types of plans and programmes that will be subjected to SE@@ As .
though a list of plans and programmes is explicitly named in Article 3 ( 2 ) of the Directive also other plans and programmes may be subjected to SE@@ A .
this includes the identification of the physical / regional limits , the impacts to be addressed and the alternative actions that need to be assessed .
this Directive is part of implementing the Aar@@ h@@ us Convention , in particular the second pillar on public participation in decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
it applies to certain plans and programmes as well as situations addressed by the E@@ IA and IP@@ PC ( Integrated Poll@@ ution Prevention and Control ) Direc@@ tives .
it am@@ ends both Direc@@ tives in that it provides detailed prescriptions on how to consult the public .
though the Directive does not apply for public consultation under the SE@@ A Directive it nevertheless provides useful guidance that may be taken into account also for the SE@@ A Directive .
member States had 2 years for its implementation , until 25 June 2005 .
5 Current situation with respect to Policy Sector
the following gives an overview on the current situation in the EN@@ P partner countries with respect to the horizontal sector .
due to data availability , most weight will be placed on the situation with regard to the E@@ IA and SE@@ A Direc@@ tives .
access to Information and Reporting
most Eastern EN@@ P partner countries have ratified the Aar@@ h@@ us Convention but lack of resources at regional and local levels make it hard to follow the Convention 's requirements .
in this context , many partner countries have taken steps to enhance public access to environmental information and to promote participation in decision @@@ -@@ @ making on environmental mat@@ ter@@ s.@@ 17
environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment
environmental Issues with Reg@@ ard to E@@ IA and SE@@ A
ME@@ T@@ AP , the Mediterranean Environment Protection Technical Assistance Program , founded in 1990 , was designed to identify environmental development projects in the region likely to be funded by the World Bank or other financial or political institutions .
its focus has been on enhancing environmental impact evaluations through reinforcing institutional and technical capabilities .
in this context , impact assessments were introduced in this region partially in order to attract investors in sustainable development .
some Southern Mediterranean neighbouring countries have well established E@@ IA systems , though E@@ IA quality and quantity varies from country to country .
since the SE@@ A is a relatively new assessment tool , most countries in this region have no formal provisions in their environmental framework .
some countries are currently developing SE@@ A procedures and / or frameworks .

another difference is that the SE@@ R / OV@@ OS process is dominated by the government in reviewing and dec@@ i @@@ -@@ @ sion @@@ -@@ @ making .
furthermore , this process does not have transparency and public participation provisions of the kind required in the EU .
after the breakdown of the Soviet Union , both procedures were continued to a greater or lesser extent .
in addition to these factors , the following issues affect application of the existing environmental assessment provisions :
the system of environmental review of projects in Russia underwent major reform in 2007 .

6 Con@@ clu@@ sions for EN@@ P and Russia
box 6 : EU funding for EN@@ P
from the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 , the EU is providing financial support for the EN@@ P through a dedicated European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA ( for the Southern Mediterranean neighbours ) and T@@ AC@@ IS ( for the Eastern neighbours and the Russian Federation ) .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
there are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the EN@@ PI countries can benefit .
this includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy .
in real terms it means as increase of 32 % as compared with the previous financial framework .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
TA@@ IE@@ X provides technical support and training in areas related to the implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including with regard to the convergence , application and enforcement of legislation .
it can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate .
the following paragraphs suggest potential steps toward convergence on the environmental horizontal legislation and issues for consideration during the process .
apart from the participation requirements as established by the Direc@@ tives , stakeholder involvement should be ensured in all stages of implementation .
it is recommended to involve all actors and stakeholders contributing to policy development , as well as those affected by the changes .
consultation processes should involve other central government ministries , regional and local government , NGOs and the general public .
many EN@@ P Eastern partner countries are facing inadequate management capacities and local financial resources .
therefore , it is important to ensure adequate staff@@ ing .
furthermore , it is vital to set up a clear division with respect to which level of government is responsible in order to avoid double work and unnecessary use of funds .
many EN@@ P partner countries , however , are characterised by com@@ part@@ ment@@ alised administrative structures , a main concern of al@@ igning national with the EU provisions will be to improve cooperation within the administration .
strategic planning is necessary to define the aims of convergence and identify priorities and barriers and select options .
it should be realistically assessed to what extent the EN@@ P partner country can align with the EU Direc@@ tives and in what areas convergence can bring the greatest benefits .
since the horizontal Direc@@ tives do not require big infrastructure investments implementation is not very costly compared to waste or water legislation .
legislation affecting industrial or commercial sectors that make significant contributions to the economy should be addressed before those that relate to small or insignificant industries .
since the horizontal Direc@@ tives do not distinguish between different sectors , they all may be applied at an early stage .
institutional gap analysis and implementation gap analysis .
if convergence with different EU Direc@@ tives is envisaged , it may be useful to link the different processes , since institutional and administrative requirements may be similar for different Direc@@ tives .
for the horizontal legislation , this is of special relevance since the Reporting Directive and the Directive for providing for public participation in E@@ IA for instance concern a number of environmental Direc@@ tives .
it may also prove beneficial to combine implementation of the E@@ IA and SE@@ A Direc@@ tives since they are similar in many respects .
the costs of implementing convergence should be estimated at an early stage and a financing strategy should be prepared .
a benefit of the horizontal Direc@@ tives is that they are administrative in nature and require virtually no capital investment .
the following gives a short impression of the major types of costs related to the horizontal Direc@@ tives :
however , it is quite likely , that these will not cover all costs involved in obtaining the information .
a list of the types of costs usually incur@@ ring to implement the Directive is given below :
box 7 : types of Cost incurred with Implementation of the Access to Information Directive
source : hand@@ book on the Implementation of EC Environmental Legis@@ lation .
in case of the E@@ IA and SE@@ A Direc@@ tives , costs are expected to be significant in particular in countries currently re@@ organising their administrative structures from a centr@@ alised to a decentr@@ alised system .
the following costs are expected to occur for setting up an environmental impact assessment system or an SE@@ A procedure :
box 8 : types of Cost incurred with Implementation

on the basis of the strategic and financial planning , an implementation plan should be developed detail@@ ing the steps necessary to implement convergence according to the priorities and objectives identified in the earlier planning phases .
implementation plans should allow sufficient time to give all actors and stakeholders affected time to adjust to the changes and make the necessary investments .
in terms of time needed for implementation , a look at the Member States may serve as indication .
however , the situation in the EN@@ P partner countries is quite different to that in the Member States and the usefulness of reference to Member States therefore limited .
a look at the new Member States may be more helpful .
it may be concluded that the time given to the new Member States for implementation can serve as guidance .
the most important elements of implementation plans are :
similarly , in the Mediterranean EN@@ P partner countries , different national laws are sometimes in conflict with one another , which could make convergence rather difficult .
furthermore , the gap between legal requirements on paper and actual implementation is considerable .

7 Fur@@ ther Information
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was created in 2003 / 2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries .
it is a collective EU response to the aspirations of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity , stability and security in our region .
the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
the political , economic , social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East - Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and the Southern Caucasus , and to the South , in the Mediterranean region , are wor@@ ry@@ ingly large and in certain cases increasing .
the EU wants to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours .
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy represents a new approach in the EU 's relations with its neighbours .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 1 .
the necessary legal and institutional framework for intensified cooperation with EN@@ P partners are Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements or Association Agre@@ ements .
the tools , however , to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed , tailor @@@ -@@ @ made EN@@ P Action Pl@@ ans@@ 2 with short and medium term priorities ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years ) .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
in that context , it goes further than promoting sustainable development and fighting poverty to encompass , for example , considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU 's internal market .
legislative and regulatory convergence and institution building is supported through mechanisms such as the exchange of experience , long term tw@@ inning arrangements with Member States or participation in Community programmes and agencies .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA and T@@ AC@@ IS and other existing geographical and thematic instruments .
the Commission has set up a web @@@ -@@ @ site explaining the EN@@ P and its processes and containing key EN@@ P documents such as the Strategy P@@ apers , the Action Plans and Progress Reports .
please refer to : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / world / EN@@ P / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m.
to this end , the European Commission has initiated the production of six short guides on the following topics :
where relevant the guides address the seven Th@@ ematic Strate@@ gies under the 6th Environment Action Programme ( E@@ AP ) 4 .
climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU 's environmental cooperation with partner countries , which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address .
the purpose of this policy guide on nature is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioriti@@ s@@ ation and sequ@@ encing of activities .
the guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environment policy and legislation can assist the EN@@ P partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
this includes summar@@ ising the main provisions of the legislation .
the guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean EN@@ P partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence .
finally , it identifies useful steps to be taken to promote convergence .
since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably , the guides take a general approach and references to specific countries are not made .
the relevance of full or partial convergence is also to be seen in this light .

the problems that this policy aims to address :
loss of biodiversity : the main concern is the loss of biodiversity in ecosystems at the species and gene levels .
it also addresses the ongoing fragmentation of habitats directly linked to the provision of ecosystem servic@@ es@@ 6 .
therefore , for the well @@@ -@@ @ being of ecosystems and the people relying on them it is crucial to conserve biodiversity .
ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems .

by conver@@ ging to EU Nature Protection Policy , the EN@@ P partner countries can obtain certain benefits that address some of the environmental problems of biodiversity and nature conservation within their countries .
moreover , EU Nature Protection Policy can assist in improving weak socio @@@ -@@ @ economic situations and the provision of ecosystem services in general .

4 Overview of EU Nature Protection Policy
this section briefly provides a background of the Nature Conservation and Bio@@ diversity Policy of the EU .
it thereby highlights concepts and policy instruments in selected pieces of EU Nature Protection legislation .
the vast majority of European habitats have been shaped and managed by people for millennia , resulting in a unique mosaic of natural and semi @@@ -@@ @ natural habitats .
the biodiversity of the EU - essential for providing important services for human living - continues to be under serious threat .
habitats and ecosystems are also at risk ; for example , around 60 % of wet@@ lands have been lost in Northern and Western Europe .
only a fraction of the natural forest that once covered much of Europe remains intact ; forest fires continue to cause severe problems in Southern Europe .
the European Union has been involved in efforts to protect the continent 's heritage for the past 30 years .
several steps have been taken , including participation in international conventions and forums .
during the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg , 130 world leaders committed themselves to significantly reducing global biodiversity loss by 2010 .
the EU committed to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 .
opinion polls show that these concerns for nature and biodiversity are strongly supported by EU citiz@@ ens@@ .@@ 9
hal@@ ting the loss of biodiversity is an objective of " Nature and Bio@@ diversity , " one of the four environmental areas for priority actions within the 6th E@@ AP of the European Community ( 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 ) .
• Protect and where necessary restore the structure and function of natural systems . • Hal@@ t the loss of biodiversity both in the European Union and on a global scale . • Protect soils against erosion and pollution .
this thematic approach should ensure that different parts of environ@@ - mental policy are linked to other policy areas .
both the Marine Th@@ ematic Strategy and So@@ il Th@@ ematic Strategy were also established with the aim of achieving the aforementioned objectives .
in order to speed up the move towards the overall goal of hal@@ ting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 , the Commission issued in 2006 a Communication " hal@@ ting the loss of Bio@@ diversity by 2010 - and Bey@@ ond .
sustaining ecosystem services for human @@@ -@@ @ being , " accompanied by an Action Plan@@ 12@@ that aims to structure and define the responsibilities between national and EU institutions and moreover to monitor the progress of hal@@ ting the loss of biodiversity .
the requirements , listed in the Communication , need to be integrated in other policy areas , such as farming , fishing and other industries .
6th Environmental Action Programme
the Bir@@ ds Directive requires that Special Protection Areas ( SP@@ As ) be established for listed bird species and for regularly occurring migr@@ atory species of birds .
the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive similarly requires Special Areas of Conservation ( SA@@ Cs ) to be designated for listed plant and animal species , and habitats .
together , SP@@ As and SA@@ Cs make up the Nat@@ ura 2000 sites .
the Nat@@ ura 2000 network already comprises more than 20,000 sites , covering almost a fifth of the EU territory .
it is co @@@ -@@ @ financed through the Commission 's LIF@@ E Nature Program@@ me@@ 14 ( set up in 1992 to develop EU environmental policy ) and other Community financial instruments .
besides these two directives there are further relevant pieces of EU nature protection legislation , summar@@ ised in Box 1 .
the following sections present selected elements of EU nature protection policy in more detail .
more information about EU nature protection policy and the full text of legislation and other documents is available at the Commission 's web@@ sit@@ e.@@ 15
box 1 : EU nature protection related legisl@@ ation@@ 16
other EU legislation relevant to nature protection include :
environmental Impact Assessment Directive ( 85 / 3@@ 37 / E@@ EC ) , amended by Council Directive 97 / 11 / EC , Access to Environmental Information Directive ( 90 / 3@@ 13 / E@@ EC ) , Reporting Directive ( 91 / 6@@ 92 / E@@ EC ) .
related multilateral environmental agreements
various multilateral environmental agreements or conventions have been concluded for nature protection .
the European Community takes an active part in the elaboration , ratification and implementation of multilateral environmental agreements .
the EC Treaty explicitly fores@@ ees the possibility for the European Community to participate in international environmental agreements , together with its Member Stat@@ es.@@ 17
they are named chron@@ ologically below ( see Box 2 ) and will be described briefly in section 4.3 after the section on the Hab@@ it@@ ats and the Wild Bir@@ ds Directive .
box 2 : multilateral environmental agreements on nature protection
the Directive established the European ecological network " Nat@@ ura 2000 " in order to ensure habitat and species protection .
box 3 : definitions of Spec@@ ies of Community interest
the first stage involves a scientific assessment at the national level .
each Member State identifies important sites for the species and habitats present in their territory on the basis of common scientific criteria and following the criteria set out in the annex@@ es .
the second stage involves selecting sites of Community importance ( S@@ IC@@ s ) from the national lists according to one of the bi@@ og@@ e@@ ographical regions in Europe .
this is done by the European Commission in close collaboration with the Member States and scientific experts .
stage three : once the sites are selected under stage two , they become part of the Nat@@ ura 2000 Network .
Ann@@ ex@@ V lists animal and plant species of community interest whose taking in the wild and exploitation may be subject to management measures .
the following box gives an overview of environmental and socio @@@ -@@ @ economic benefits that can be achieved by implementing the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive .
good signs of commitment to the conservation of biodiversity by European countries are shown by the increase in the total surface cover of nationally @@@ -@@ @ designated areas over time .
the implementation of the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive has shown that environmental as well as socio @@@ -@@ @ eco @@@ -@@ @ nom@@ ic ben@@ ets can be obtained .
natural Her@@ it@@ ages The Carpath@@ ian Mountains contain many spectacular natural treasures currently being brought into the EU fold .
through implementing the Nat@@ ura 2000 network and signing the Carpath@@ ian Convention ( 2003 ) , countries of the region have already committed to preserving these unique natural riches .
developing products and log@@ os@@ 2@@ 1@@ The Nat@@ ura 2000 identity can offer a valuable opportunity to brand regional products , complement@@ ing specific local brands and under@@ lining particular local qualities .
these include " Vil@@ d@@ m@@ ose potatoes " in Denmark , " Salt from the La@@ ess@@ oe , " vodka with bis@@ on@@ grass from Poland , pum@@ p@@ kin oil from the M@@ ur region in Austria and Pi@@ ir@@ iss@@ aar Island on@@ ions from Estonia .
cultural landscapes : Hungarian P@@ us@@ z@@ ta Many of the Nat@@ ura 2000 sites reflect the richness in biodiversity that is a " by product " of traditional , extensive agricultural practices that are still widespread in the new Member States .
an exceptional example of this is the Hungarian P@@ us@@ z@@ ta , a semi @@@ -@@ @ natural grass@@ land ecosystem which stretches between the Alpine and Carpath@@ ian mountain ranges , that is the result of centuries of extensive gra@@ zing by Hungarian grey cattle and sheep .
in Belgium , a network of cycle routes and nature trails and a network of horse @@@ -@@ @ riding trails is currently being developed .
in Denmark , access and proximity to the site supports local people 's quality of life as well as attracting new inhabitants to the area .
the Austrian landscape and nature resource of the Border M@@ ur forms the basis for a growing tourism based on hot springs and cycling .
the objective of the Directive is to provide for the protection , management and control of naturally occurring wild birds and their ne@@ sts , eggs and habitats , as well as to regulate the exploitation of these species within the European Union .
besides creating SP@@ As , Member States shall maintain habitats , restore destroyed bi@@ ot@@ op@@ es and create bi@@ ot@@ op@@ es for naturally occurring wild birds .
comparable to the Ann@@ exes of the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive , the Ann@@ exes of the Wild Bir@@ ds Directive were amended to take into account the biodiversity of new Member States .
furthermore , the Member States must encourage research and activities conducive to the protection , management and exploitation of the bird species covered by the Direc@@ tiv@@ es.@@ 22
the following Box 5 provides information on important environmental results that have been achieved by implementing the Wild Bir@@ ds Directive .

related multilateral environmental agreements
in this section , the most relevant agreements are briefly described .
( opened for signature in Ram@@ sar , Iran : 1971 ; En@@ tered into force : 1975 )
sites included in the Ram@@ sar list should be the subject of conservation measures , which include the establishment of nature reserves .
( opened for signature in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil : 1992 ; En@@ tered into force : 1994 )
this Convention addresses important issues such as access to genetic resources , the equitable distribution of benefits derived from the use of these resources , transfer of relevant technologies and financial support .
moreover , cooperation among states and intergovernmental organisations should be promoted .
signatories to the Convention prepare national biodiversity strategies and plans to integrate the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources into relevant sectoral or cross @@@ -@@ @ sectoral plans , programmes or policies .
the EU is a signat@@ ory to the Convention and has developed an EU Bio@@ diversity Strategy as well as Bio@@ diversity Action plans dealing with integration of biodiversity into different policy sectors .
Convention on International Trade in En@@ dang@@ ered Spec@@ ies of Wild F@@ auna and Flor@@ a
( opened for signature in Washington : 1973 , En@@ tered into force : 1975 )
the CIT@@ ES convention aims to protect species of wild fauna and flora and to guarantee their conservation by regulating their trade .
trade in endangered species , listed on the Convention 's Appendix I , is normally prohibited ( exceptions may be made , for example to establish captive breeding schemes ) .
( opened for signature in Bonn , Germany : 1979 ; En@@ tered into force : 1983 )
the Bonn Convention ( CMS ) aims to protect migr@@ atory animals over the whole of their range .
on the one hand , the Convention provides a framework and practical mechanisms for linking protected areas along migration paths to form a common bond between them .
on the other hand it provides a rationale for the increasingly popular trend of tw@@ inning protected are@@ as@@ 25 .
the Range States are required to give them full protection from such activities as hunting , fishing , capturing , harass@@ ing and deliberate killing and should endeavour to conserve their habitat .
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Hab@@ it@@ ats
( opened for signature in Ber@@ ne , Switzerland : 1979 , En@@ tered into force : 1982 )
the B@@ ern Convention is an international legal instrument in the field of nature conservation that seeks to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats , with particular emphasis to endangered and vulnerable species and sustainable development .
in 1998 the Emer@@ ald Network was launched by the Council of Europe as part of its work under the B@@ ern Convention .
for EU Member States , Emer@@ ald Net@@ work@@ 26 sites are those of the Nat@@ ura 2000 network , established through the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive .

further relevant EU Nature Protection Policy
besides the Direc@@ tives and International Agre@@ ements described in the previous paragraphs , there exists some further EU strategies and documents foc@@ us@@ sing on Nature Protection that could be of interest for the European neighbours .
the EU has produced a series of recommendations , guidance and studies on integrated coastal zone management .
from 1996 to 1999 , the Commission carried out a Dem@@ on@@ stration Programme on IC@@ Z@@ M with the purpose of collecting technical information and stimulating a debate among different stakeholders on coastal zone management .
in a next step the Commission adopted a Strategy on IC@@ Z@@ M , followed by a Recommendation on the implementation of IC@@ Z@@ M in Europe that was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 200@@ 2@@ 27 .
the non @@@ -@@ @ binding Recommendation defines the steps that the Member States should take to develop national strategies for IC@@ Z@@ M , due by 2006 .
under the CF@@ P , the EU has developed a series of measures designed to reduce and eliminate over fishing .
moreover , there exists a Commun@@ ic@@ ation@@ 28 on a Strategy for integrating environmental protection con@@ sid@@ - er@@ ations into the CF@@ P , produced by the Commission .
this strategy provides useful concepts , which could be referred to by European neighbours when developing their own policy or strategy on sustainable fisheries .
EU 's Eastern EN@@ P partner countries and Russia
5.@@ 1.1 Par@@ ticul@@ ar concerns and challenges
in particular , the Black Sea is under serious stress from un@@ treated sewage , leading to degradation of its biodiversity , habitats , fisheries resources , aesthetic and recreational value and water quality .
5.@@ 1.2 Institu@@ tional set up
meanwhile , environmental authorities have been established in all countries , mostly through the creation of a Ministry of Environment .
these ministries are responsible for setting environmental policy , developing and implementing legislation and regulation .
environmental policies of the Eastern EN@@ P partner countries have been formulated through a number of national strategies , legislation and policy statements .
the Common Economic Space roadmap under the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Strategic Partnership provides for " cooperation in the sphere of biodiversity conservation including the development of systems of protected areas , according to the Convention on Biological Diversity . "
these comprise Moldova , Belarus , Ukraine , Georgia , Azerbaijan and Armen@@ i@@ a.@@ S@@ uch plans are adopted for Ukraine , Moldova , Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
5.@@ 2.1 Par@@ ticul@@ ar concerns and challenges
the Mediterranean partner@@ s@@ 31 mostly suffer from the scarcity of fresh water , a growing gap between supply and demand of water , decreasing water quality and dominance of agricultural water use .
for this reason , key environmental challenges concern the depletion and sal@@ in@@ isation of water supplies .
5.@@ 2.2 Institu@@ tional set up
very few countries have environmental legislation dating back before the early 1980s .
however , today all Mediterranean EN@@ P partner countries have regional environmental authorities .
in general , the key institution is the Ministry of Environment .
there are specific efforts to enhance cooperation for nature protection between Europe and the European neighbouring countries .
these include the developed Framework of the Euro @@@ -@@ @ Mediterranean partnership , the Short and Medium @@@ -@@ @ Term Pri@@ ority Environmental Action Programme ( SM@@ AP ) 32 and the Mediterranean Action Plan ( UNEP / M@@ AP ) .
several regional activity centres have been set to implement the UNEP / M@@ AP at the regional , national and local levels .
moreover , some countries focus on action towards adoption of plans and programmes related to biodiversity and the exchange of experience on protection of biological diversity and rural landscape , with special attention to the relevant migr@@ atory species .
6 Con@@ clu@@ sions for EN@@ P partner countries
box 6 : EU funding for EN@@ P
from the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 , the EU is providing financial support for the EN@@ P through a dedicated European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA ( for the Southern Mediterranean neighbours ) and T@@ AC@@ IS ( for the Eastern neighbours and the Russian Federation ) .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
there are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the EN@@ PI countries can benefit .
this includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy .
in real terms it means as increase of 32 % as compared with the previous financial framework .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
it can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate .
main challenges and priority tasks
as for the Eastern EN@@ P partner countries and Russia , movement toward the environmental acqu@@ is in the area of nature protection will be challenging for the Mediterranean EN@@ P partner countries .
therefore , the development of individual strategies for each interested country is required .
the following paragraphs suggest potential steps toward convergence with EU Nature Protection Policy and issues to be considered during the process .
these steps address a gap analysis and the setting of convergence priorities , general requirements as well as five specific tasks , listed in chron@@ ological order .
gap analysis and set convergence priorities
initial step for all countries should be the setting of convergence priorities and targets .
it should be realistically assessed to which extent the EN@@ P partner country can align with the EU Nature Protection Direc@@ tives and in what areas convergence can bring the greatest benefits .
this should lead to both a prioriti@@ s@@ ation of tasks ( based on the urgency of issues , legislative considerations , cost @@@ -@@ @ effectiveness and economic considerations ) and the development of a national strategy to convergence with European Nature Protection legislation .
one important task within this process is a gap analysis considering in particular :
general requirements for the implementation process
to ensure successful adaptation of the nature protection legislation , competent authorities need to involve stakeholders , such as farmers , private land@@ owners , user groups , planning authorities and NGOs , from the beginning .
in this context , an informed dialogue and debate is required to increase confidence in site designation , to reduce resistance and concern and to increase collaboration between individual stakeholders .
in addition , dialogue to clarify real costs and opportunities is essential .
public Particip@@ ation has to be put into practice , for example by implementing the Aar@@ h@@ us Con@@ venti@@ on@@ 36 .
in general , there is a strong need to enhance environmental awareness .
public information should be avail@@ - able and consultation processes should be established .
most European neighbouring countries do not provide procedures for public participation in drafting and implementation of laws and regulations within the state .
this is one of the main causes for lack of implementation .
EN@@ P partner countries should assess which step is the most appropriate , taking into account their starting points .
some EN@@ P partner countries need to strengthen their environmental legislation or even to develop a new nature protection law in order to tran@@ sp@@ ose the selected requirements of the Direc@@ tives into national legislation .
therefore , administrative and institutional capacity must be strengthened to ensure that the whole Nat@@ ura 2000 process can be handled as an opportunity for promoting nature conservation and sustainable rural and regional development .
for example , co @@@ -@@ @ ordination mechanisms need to be established in order to ensure integration of nature protection concerns within other policies , ministries and institutions , for example , agriculture , fisheries , forestry or tour@@ is@@ m.@@ 37
in some countries administrative and institutional reform and / or capacity building will be necessary in order to successfully adopt Nature Protection legislation that conver@@ ges toward EU Direc@@ tives .
this also includes appropriate scientific evidence to identify sites that qualify for designation , such as SA@@ Cs or SP@@ As .
overall , more clearly defined responsibilities and functions of the different state environmental authorities and specialised institutions at national , regional and local level are needed in order to make the policy process more effective and efficient .
clearly defined responsibilities and functions will help to improve accountability and transparency .
currently , in the EN@@ P partner countries , several institutions are involved in the biodiversity management and overlap in their responsibilities .
therefore , they would benefit from the assignment of one or two institutions and their respective authorities to designate , establish and monitor the protected areas .
future management of protected areas requires the establishment of competent authorities for nature conservation at regional or local level .
a further important task of these authorities is to assess , monitor , and evaluate the occurren@@ ces of particular habitats and species in these areas .
this will require cooperation between specialist staff and between all management authorities and enforcement agencies .
in addition , it may be necessary to train members of the various competent authorities , ensuring cooperation at national , regional and local levels at every stage .
selection process of SC@@ Is and SP@@ As
one of the most demanding and time consuming tasks is the identification and selection of important sites ( SC@@ Is ) for the species and habitats in the territory based on common scientific criteria as well as the criteria set out in the annex@@ es .
the selection process should also include nomination of Special Protection Areas ( SP@@ As ) in accordance with the requirements of the Bir@@ ds Directive .
through experiences of EU Member States , it became obvious that this process can take up to 10 years .
therefore , this action should start as soon as possible .
in this process the assistance of a specially trained expert may be useful , in particular when EN@@ P partner countries have to cope with limited environmental management capacity and experience within environmental authorities and institutions .
EN@@ P partner countries that have already joined the emer@@ ald network as part of the B@@ ern Convention and designated Areas of Special Conservation Interest ( ASC@@ Is ) could consider them within this process .
coherent and integrated policies and programmes for designated areas can enhance successful adaptation of European nature protection legislation .
therefore , Nat@@ ura 2000 sites " assets and associated activities and benefits should be integrated into local , rural , regional and national development plans as far as possible .
this requires a comprehensive review of sectoral objectives ( e.g. covering transport , local economic development incentives ) .

an efficient national environmental monitoring system for protected areas , using a harmon@@ ised methodology carried out by one institution , should be established .

costs estimates for implementing EU Nature Protection Direc@@ tives and experiences in the new Member States
unlike legislation dealing with waste management or air protection , Nature Protection Policy will not require large infra@@ structural investments .
when discussing costs of Nat@@ ura 2000 , local stakeholders are often referring to constraints to their economic activity resulting from the designation or management of a site .
such constraints may in fact be more limited than many expect , since Nat@@ ura 2000 will not normally require dis@@ continuation of economic activities .
however , Nat@@ ura 2000 can result in additional costs , such as reducing agricultural land prices or increasing house prices in neighbouring areas .
land use changes , such as the introduction of more sustainable fish or agricultural farming methods may also be necessary within the protected sites .
overcoming such costs will require information and awareness raising initiatives by government officials .
local stakeholders might benefit from ecosystem services ; for example , if expensive water pre @@@ -@@ @ treatment or alternative sources of water options are avoided by limiting the threat of pollution to the groundwater .
based on previous experience , the cost of Nat@@ ura 2000 in designation , planning , management , and investments varies significantly according to the site .
€ 15.@@ 000 / site to € 2 million / site / y@@ ear@@ .@@ 40 Fur@@ ther estim@@ ations of costs resulted in € 6,@@ 1 billion per year for EU 25 , but also need to be further refined and impro@@ v@@ ed@@ .@@ 41
funds may be available from a number of sources ( e.g. national , internation@@ al@@ 42 or bilateral programmes , EU funds ) .
the private sector could also play a role in environmental investment and funding .
in general , such funding usually becomes available when a positive connection between environmental protection and sustained economic and social development is made .
receiving such funds requires awareness of funding possibilities and capacity to access funds .

the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was created in 2003 / 2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries .
it is a collective EU response to the aspirations of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity , stability and security in our region .
the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
the political , economic , social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East - Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and the Southern Caucasus , and to the South , in the Mediterranean region , are wor@@ ry@@ ingly large and in certain cases increasing .
the EU wants to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours .
the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy represents a new approach in the EU 's relations with its neighbours .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 1 .
the necessary legal and institutional framework for intensified cooperation with EN@@ P partners are Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements or Association Agre@@ ements .
the tools , however , to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed , tailor @@@ -@@ @ made EN@@ P Action Pl@@ ans@@ 2 with short and medium term priorities ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years ) .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
in that context , it goes further than promoting sustainable development and fighting poverty to encompass , for example , considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU 's internal market .
the Commission has set up a web @@@ -@@ @ site explaining the EN@@ P and its processes and containing key EN@@ P documents such as the Strategy P@@ apers , the Action Plans and Progress Reports .
please refer to : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / world / EN@@ P / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m.
EN@@ P partner countries are expected to benefit considerably from full implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including from enhanced convergence with the EU approaches .
for benefits resulting from enhanced environment protection , including convergence , please refer to Chapter 3 .
in order to help partner countries to realise these benefits , the European Commission has decided to provide information on EU environment policy and legislation in key policy areas .
climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU 's environmental cooperation with partner countries , which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address .
documents on this crucial topic of common interest will be issued separately from this series of guides .
the purpose of this policy guide on IP@@ PC is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioriti@@ s@@ ation and sequ@@ encing of activities .
the guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environment policy and legislation can assist the EN@@ P partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
this includes summar@@ ising the main provisions of the legislation .
the guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean EN@@ P partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence .
finally , it identifies useful steps to be taken to promote convergence .
since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably , the guides take a general approach and references to specific countries are not made .
the relevance of full or partial convergence is also to be seen in this light .

the problems that this policy aims to address
industrial production processes account for a considerable share of the overall pollution in Europe ( for pollutants such as greenhouse gases , aci@@ di@@ fying substances , wastewater emissions and waste ) .
in essence , the Directive 96 / 61 / EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control ( IP@@ PC Directive ) is about minim@@ ising pollution from various industrial sources throughout the European Union .
operators of industrial installations covered by Annex I of the IP@@ PC Directive are required to obtain an author@@ isation ( environmental permit ) from the authorities in the EU countries .
in order to receive a permit an industrial or agricultural installation must comply with certain basic obligations .
in addition , the decision to issue a permit must contain a number of specific requirements , in particular including :
new installations , and existing installations subject to " substantial changes , " have been required to meet the requirements of the IP@@ PC Directive since 30 October 1999 .
other existing installations must be brought into compliance by 30 October 2007 .
this is the key deadline for the full implementation of the Directive .
however , the IP@@ PC Directive contains elements of flexibility by allowing the licensing authorities , in determining permit conditions , to take into account the technical characteristics of the installation , its geographical location and the local environmental conditions .
the benefits of the IP@@ PC policy include the minim@@ isation of emissions and other negative impacts on the environment caused by industrial installations subject to the IP@@ PC Directive .
the stipul@@ ation to base all permits on best available techniques will foster the diffusion of advanced technology in Europe and force operators to invest in environmentally sound technology .
the requirement for " existing " installations to abide by the requirements of the IP@@ PC Directive by October 2007 will force " outdated " industrial installations in Europe to either adapt to new standards or cease operation .
3 Ex@@ p@@ ected Benef@@ its of Conver@@ gence
the IP@@ PC Directive aims at fostering the best available techniques ( B@@ AT ) .
many types of industrial installations must be permitted on the basis of the best available techniques .
in order to give guidance as to what is considered B@@ AT , an information exchange process has been established at the European level to identify B@@ AT .
this process also raises awareness of best available techniques and results in publicly accessible documents describing B@@ AT ( Best available techniques Reference Documents , B@@ RE@@ Fs ) concerning the different types of installations .
the requirements of the IP@@ PC Directive are addressed at new and existing installations and thus promote an adaptation of old technologies to current standards , improving their environmental performance .
the public must be informed of any permit application regarding industrial activities covered by the IP@@ PC Directive and can comment on these before the competent authorities reach their decision .
the public must also be informed of the final decision and the results of the monitoring of releases .
thus , the IP@@ PC Directive also strengthens public participation in the permitting and surveillance of industrial activities .
since the IP@@ PC Directive focuses on permitting conditions and procedures , benefits of conver@@ ging with the IP@@ PC Directive are mainly expected to show in the permitting process itself .
however , an IP@@ PC consistent permitting process will lead to industrial modernisation and thus to the minim@@ isation of environmentally harmful emissions from industry , especially emission ab@@ at@@ ement .
introduction : IP@@ PC Directive as a horizontal instrument for emission ab@@ at@@ ement
industrial emissions are one of the main sources of environmental pollution ; therefore , the European Union has decided to apply a two @@@ -@@ @ fold approach to tackle this problem .
on the one hand , the different economic sectors are subject to " sector " directives that set standards and lay down requirements for the respective economic activities .
the Large Com@@ bus@@ tion Plant Directive and the W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive are examples of such sector directives .
the IP@@ PC Direc@@ tiv@@ e@@ 6 , on the other hand , is a horizontal instrument for preventing and controlling emissions from industrial installations in the EU .
the IP@@ PC Directive encompasses most industrial activities ( see
in many cases , installations are subject both to sector @@@ -@@ @ specific directives setting minimum requirements and the more flexible IP@@ PC Directive .
the IP@@ PC Directive comprises a set of common requirements that the permitting procedure must fulfil@@ . l .
the IP@@ PC Directive is one of the command @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ control instruments of European law that impose certain legal restrictions to economic activities for environmental reasons .
integrated Per@@ mits on the basis of Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ ques ( B@@ AT )
the permits issued to the installations mentioned in Annex I of the IP@@ PC Directive must be :
this concept concerns all new installations and existing installations subject to " substantial changes " from 30 October 1999 and all other existing installations from 30 October 2007 .
Directive 96 / 61 / EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control .
4.@@ 2.1 Basic permitting requirement
one of the basic requirements of the IP@@ PC Directive is that all installations mentioned in Annex I must be permitted by the competent permitting authorities .
thus , authorities must examine all such installations with regard to their potential environmental impacts , as stipulated in the IP@@ PC Directive .
4.@@ 2.2 Requirements for Integrated Per@@ mits
4.@@ 2.3 Requi@@ rement of permits based on Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ ques
the IP@@ PC Directive requires that industrial installations be based on best available techniques ( B@@ AT ) , the legal definition of the term is as follows :
best available techniques means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operations .
technique includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed , built , maintained , operated and decom@@ mis@@ sioned .
best shall mean most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole .
4.@@ 2.4 European information exchange process to describe B@@ AT per sector
for indication as to what is to be regarded as " best available techniques , " a European information exchange process , the so @@@ -@@ @ called Seville Process was created .
4.@@ 2.@@ 4.1 Information Exchange on B@@ AT ( " Seville Process " )
art 16 ( 2 ) IP@@ PC Directive calls upon the European Commission to organise an exchange of information on B@@ AT for the different Annex I activities with the Member States and industries concerned .
this exchange of information is a qu@@ int@@ essential requirement of the IP@@ PC Directive .
the IP@@ PC Bureau carries out its work through Technical Working Groups ( T@@ W@@ Gs ) for each sector comprising nominated experts from EU Member States , EF@@ TA countries , Acc@@ ession countries , industry and environmental NGOs .
these experts provide information and data and then review the draft documents the Bureau produces .
4.@@ 2.@@ 4.2 Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ ques Reference Documents ( B@@ RE@@ Fs ) : a basis of the permitting procedure in the Member States
the final results of this information exchange process are technical working documents , the so @@@ -@@ @ called Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ que Reference Documents ( B@@ RE@@ Fs ) .
B@@ RE@@ Fs include empirical data from installations of the various sectors that are viewed by the T@@ WG to represent best available techniques , including information on the monitoring of emissions from the installations .
the B@@ RE@@ Fs are thus intended to describe the B@@ AT found within the European Union , regardless of the specific standard of a specific Member State where a permit has to be issu@@ ed@@ .@@ 10
as a result , EU Member States that are technologically more advanced will be able to influence the description of B@@ AT in the B@@ RE@@ Fs in their favour .
the implementation of B@@ AT across Member States stimulates the development of new techniques and technologies .
the most practical , relevant data contained in the B@@ RE@@ Fs are the empirical emission levels of installations .
the B@@ RE@@ FS are published by the European Commission and can be down@@ load@@ ed@@ 12 .
the B@@ AT Reference documents are updated on a regular basis , typically every five to seven years .
it is up to the permitting authorities to identify what B@@ AT is for each specific case .
a few Member States ( Austria , Germany and Hungary ) derive from the B@@ RE@@ Fs general binding rules ( G@@ BR@@ s ) .
G@@ BR@@ s are limit values or other conditions usually defined in environmental laws , regulations and orders at sector level or wider , that are given with the intention to be used directly to set permit conditions .
they provide direct conditions or minimum standards . ( i.e. national laws or regulations ) that lay down general emission limit values , energy efficiency levels , monitoring requirements , etc. for the different types of industrial installations .
hence , in these states the permitting authorities have to comply with national law , which is supposed to reflect what B@@ AT is for the different industrial installations .
these general binding rules are binding for the permitting authorities and constitute minimum requirements .
in many cases , these general binding rules were in force in the respective Member State prior to the IP@@ PC Directive , 14 but in some cases had to be adapted to the B@@ AT as described in the respective B@@ RE@@ F .
if e.g. a permit has to be issued for a waste incin@@ eration plant in Latvia or Spain , it is not relevant what are best available techniques in Latvia or Spain but what are the best available techniques on the EU level .
see Summary of IP@@ PC Conference " On the Road to Sustainable Production in the enlarged EU , " http : / / www.@@ ec@@ ologic @@@ -@@ @ event@@ s.@@ de / IP@@ PC / en / documents / summary _ n@@ al@@ .p@@ df , p .
one of the countries employing general binding rules is Germany .
in the event that B@@ RE@@ Fs or advanced drafts existed at the time of the adoption of the German general binding rules , their information was taken into account in determining the emission control requirements .
a system for automatically updating the basic emission law ( TA Lu@@ ft ) when a B@@ RE@@ F provides new B@@ AT standards has been established .
if the committee concludes that the state of techniques has developed or that the specifications of the TA Lu@@ ft need to be supplemented , the BM@@ U provides notification of this following a defined procedure .
the licensing and monitoring authorities must then take into account changes to the state of techni@@ ques@@ .@@ 15
4.@@ 2.5 Application of B@@ AT on new and existing installations in the EU
the permit requirement for the installations subject to the IP@@ PC Directive has been applied to " new " installations since 30 October 1999 .
for existing installations , those installations that were put into operation or permitted before the implementation of the Direc@@ tiv@@ e@@ 16 , full compliance with the Directive is required by 30 October 2007 .
through the implementation of B@@ AT for both new and existing installations the IP@@ PC Directive acts as an instrument to modern@@ ise industrial installations throughout the European Union .
4.@@ 2.6 Requi@@ rement to reconsider and update permits
according to Ar@@ t. 13 of the IP@@ PC Directive , Member States must take the necessary measures to ensure that competent authorities periodically reconsider and , where necessary , update permit conditions .
this is inter alia the case :
the results of monitoring of releases as required under the permit conditions referred to in Article 9 of the IP@@ PC Directive and held by the competent authority must also be made available to the public ( Ar@@ t. 15 ( 2 ) IP@@ PC Directive ) .
4.@@ 2.@@ 7.2 The Public European pollut@@ ant E@@ missions Register ( EP@@ ER ) and E @@@ -@@ @ PR@@ TR ( European pollut@@ ant Release and Transfer Register )
the Decision of the European Commission on the implementation of a European pollut@@ ant E@@ mission Register ( EP@@ ER ) solidi@@ fies the obligations laid down in Ar@@ t. 15 ( 3 ) IP@@ PC Directive .
as successor of the EP@@ ER , the European pollut@@ ant Release and Transfer Register ( European PR@@ TR ) has been created by Regulation ( EC ) No 166 / 2006 , adopted on 18 January 2006 .
the PR@@ TR 's first edition is expected to be published in the autumn of 2009 and will include data for the first reporting year 2007 .
the European PR@@ TR will be more comprehensive than EP@@ ER as it will cover more than 91 substances emitted from industrial installations in 65 different sectors of activity ( respectively 50 substances and 56 sectors under EP@@ ER ) .
the PR@@ TR will include transfers of waste and wastewater from industrial facilities to other locations , as well as data on emissions caused by accidents on facilities " sites .
the European PR@@ TR will also be published annually , a much shorter time period than the tri@@ ennial reports under EP@@ ER .
ben@@ ets of EP@@ ER in the Member States and for the European Commission
the collection of emissions data by the Member States enables the Member States and the European Commission to identify the most polluted industrial sites in the respective Member States and allows the permitting authorities to set priorities in their monitoring and inspection activities .
since the register is publicly available , the public and NGOs have a solid instrument to identify poll@@ uting sites in their proximity .
this may facilitate campaigns for a higher environmental standard , especially for emission ab@@ at@@ ement in certain areas .
therefore , the EP@@ ER / E @@@ -@@ @ PR@@ TR makes the industrial processes more transparent to the " outside world . "
5 Current situation with respect to Policy Sector
since industrial installations in the East European EN@@ P partners and Russia often date from Soviet times , in many cases the technology is outdated .
such installations are note cient with regard to energy , waste production and waste recovery .
in these areas , activities such as oil and gas extraction , along with transportation and industrial production ( especially energy production ) , have been the source of severe air , water , and soil pollution ( e.g. in the Caspian region ) .
important sources for pollution are oil and gas extraction ( oil fields ) and refineries , as well as agricultural , industrial and municipal waste that is often discharged without any treatment into the sea , causing significant marine pollu@@ tion@@ .@@ 18
as for the Mediterranean EN@@ P partners , all of these countries have gone through a period of industri@@ alisation in recent times .
more efficient and w@@ aster@@ educ@@ ing technologies are needed .
particular concerns and challenges
the modernisation of outdated industrial installations is a great challenge that must be addressed in order to improve the environmental situation .
such installations generate emissions that far exceed the environmental standards set by EU law ( e.g. by the sectoral directives and the IP@@ PC Directive ) .
the Mediterranean Partners include the North African states of Tunisia , Algeria , Morocco , Egypt and Libya , as well as Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , the Palestinian Authority and Syria in the Middle East .

5.@@ 2.2 Eastern European Neigh@@ b@@ ours and Russia
the EU 's Eastern EN@@ P partners are comprised of Belar@@ us@@ 23 , Moldova , Ukraine , as well as Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus .
the following regulatory challenges for reform of the existent permitting systems can be identified : ed :
institutional challenges include :
5.@@ 2.3 Common Chall@@ eng@@ es for all EN@@ P partners
although the countries in Eastern Europe feature environmental laws that form a framework for the permitting procedure for industrial installations , there is no requirement to employ B@@ AT to operate industrial installations .
in addition , a clear definition of B@@ AT is lacking for those countries willing to employ B@@ AT .
while the modernisation of the existing industrial installations is of paramount concern , national legislation in the EN@@ P partners and Russia does not compel industries to adapt their technologies to best technical standards .
the authorities in these countries do not have a list of industrial installations and their current emission levels .
therefore , no Action Plan exists for this country .
6 Con@@ clu@@ sions for EN@@ P and Russia
from the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 , the EU is providing financial support for the EN@@ P through a dedicated European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
the EN@@ PI replaces ME@@ DA ( for the Southern Mediterranean neighbours ) and T@@ AC@@ IS ( for the Eastern neighbours and the Russian Federation ) .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
there are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the EN@@ PI countries can benefit .
this includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy .
in real terms it means as increase of 32 % as compared with the previous financial framework .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
TA@@ IE@@ X provides technical support and training in areas related to the implementation of the EN@@ P Action Plans , including with regard to the convergence , application and enforcement of legislation .
it can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate .
the IP@@ PC Directive and the accompanying Commission Deci@@ sions establishing EP@@ ER and E @@@ -@@ @ PR@@ TR have created a new approach in controlling and reducing emissions from industrial installations .
the requirement of basing permitting for new and existing industrial installations on B@@ AT is an instrument to foster the modernisation of all installations within a country .
as one of the most fundamental problems in the EN@@ P partners and Russia is outdated technology , the approach of the IP@@ PC Directive could be of significant interest for these countries .
step @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ step approach to control emissions from industrial installations
this step @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ step approach could include the following steps and Sub@@ steps :
6.@@ 1.1 Per@@ mit requirement and minimum standard requirements for a permit to be issued ( Step 1 )
integrated Per@@ mit requirement ( sub@@ step 2 )
permits should , therefore , be issued as integrated permits .
the permit must set conditions in a holistic way and take into account all possible environmental effects that could be caused by the industrial installation in question .
this does not necessarily mean that only one permit is required , or that only one authority examines all relevant aspects .
instead , it implies that the potential impact of a certain industrial activity on the environment as a whole is assessed in the permitting procedure .
further information concerning the adaptation of the permitting system to an integrated permitting system can be found in : http : / / www.@@ o@@ ec@@ d@@ .org / dat@@ a@@ o@@ ec@@ d / 54 / 31 / 3@@ 50@@ 5@@ 66@@ 7@@ 8.@@ p@@ df ( 25 may 2007 ) .
for this see : integrated Environmental permitting Guidelines for Countries of Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia ( EECCA ) http : / / www.@@ o@@ ec@@ d@@ .org / dat@@ a@@ o@@ ec@@ d / 54 / 31 / 3@@ 50@@ 5@@ 66@@ 7@@ 8.@@ p@@ df
this would be the decisive lever to foster the modernisation of the industrial installation existing in the EN@@ P partners and Russia .
in order to be effective , the permitting authorities must strictly enforce the requirements laid down by the national permitting laws .
best practice examples of such a structure should be exchanged between the countries .
6.@@ 1.2 Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ ques as a basis for a permit to be issued ( Step 2 )
in order to achieve a sophisticated technological level and to enhance environmental protection , the EN@@ P partners could engage - similar to the EU - in their own information exchange process among themselves to determine the B@@ AT in the region .
once the B@@ AT is identified through this exchange , it should be used as a guid@@ eline to modern@@ ise existing installations and permit new installations .
this process will require a significant organisational effort by the different countries to analyse the best available technologies available in their territory and / or affordable for their industry .
another alternative would be to use the existing B@@ RE@@ Fs published by the European Commission as a basis to identify B@@ AT for the region .
the information contained in the B@@ RE@@ F could convey what is achievable by the best available technique in Europe and could be adapted to the situation in the EN@@ P partners .
moreover , the observation of the development of the B@@ RE@@ Fs ( i.e. the foreseen " updates " of the B@@ RE@@ Fs every three years ) by the neighbouring countries could be a useful strategy to pursue this aim .
it is , for example , conceivable that techniques no longer considered B@@ AT in the European Union would constitute a considerable improvement in the technological standard in the neighbouring countries of the EU .
6.@@ 1.3 Pub@@ l@@ ication of emission levels in the Eastern and Mediterranean Countries ( additional step )
in order to achieve transparency and to inform the population about the current emission levels in the different regions and loc@@ alities , the Eastern and Mediterranean countries could institute an instrument mod@@ elled on the EP@@ ER or E @@@ -@@ @ PR@@ TR@@ .@@ 29
in turn , it would provide an additional measure to motivate operators of industrial installations to make efforts to decrease industrial emissions .
challenges to Conver@@ gence and Co@@ sts
a challenge to convergence is that the IP@@ PC Directive is rather demanding in its stipul@@ ations , possibly over@@ bur@@ dening some countries that do not currently have an elaborate permitting system in place .
the experiences of implementation and enforcement of the IP@@ PC Directive in the European Union can provide some valuable orientation for the EN@@ P partners .
this information can be gathered inter alia at the national focal points for the information exchange process according to the IP@@ PC Directive , for example the German Um@@ wel@@ t@@ bun@@ des@@ am@@ t .
implementation reports from the Member States can also be found at the European Commission 's IP@@ PC website : http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / environment / IP@@ PC / index@@ .@@ ht@@ m .
permit requirements that demand a high level of technology and emission ab@@ at@@ ement could stifle economic growth , depending on the industry .

EU action against climate change
a global challenge that requires global action
EU initiatives show the way ahead
statement by EU leaders on post @@@ -@@ @ 2012 action , March 2007
developed countries must continue to lead ...
... But action by developing countries is also essential
man @@@ -@@ @ made emissions of greenhouse gases are causing these changes .
we C@@ AN@@ NOT allow this to happen .
the European Union considers it vital to prevent global warming of more than 2@@ º@@ C above the pre @@@ -@@ @ industrial level .
there is considerable scientific evidence that beyond this threshold irreversible and potentially catastrophic changes could occur .
in March 2007 , EU heads of state and government endorsed an integrated climate change and energy strategy put forward by the European Commission .
this sets out the EU 's proposals for a comprehensive global agreement to combat climate change after 2012 , when the Kyoto Protocol 's emission targets will expire .
UN negotiations on this agreement are due to be concluded at the end of 2009 .
they are almost certainly the international community 's last chance to prevent climate change from reaching dangerous levels .
the growing evidence of the cost of climate change points to one simple conclusion : we C@@ AN@@ NOT afford to do nothing .
recent studies , such as the UK government 's Ster@@ n Review on the economics of climate change , reaffirm the enormous costs of failing to act .
these costs - not only economic but social and environmental , too - will fall especially heavily on the poor , in developed and developing countries alike .
allowing climate change to continue un@@ abated would also have serious regional and global security implications .
the IPCC 's Fourth Assessment Report ( AR@@ 4 ) shows that climate change is already having strong effects on ecosystems , water resources and coastal zones across the world .
it is affecting people in various ways , including higher mortality during he@@ at@@ waves , water scarcity , and changes in the distribution of diseases carried by v@@ ectors such as tic@@ ks and mosquitoes .
taking global action to combat climate change is thus the pro @@@ -@@ @ growth strategy for the longer term .
the earlier we act , less costly the action will be .
the European Commission 's analysis shows that the investment needed to achieve a low @@@ -@@ @ carbon economy would cost only around 0.5 % of world GDP between 2013 and 2030 .
the emission cuts needed to keep within a 2 ° C temperature rise would reduce average GDP growth by less than 0.@@ 12 % points per year up to 2050 , the AR@@ 4 estimates .
a global challenge that requires global action
the Kyoto Protocol is a vital first step .
it has succeeded in putting in place a set of international rules , market @@@ -@@ @ based mechanisms and funds for addressing climate change .
it requires developed countries to start reducing their greenhouse gas emissions .
but climate change is a global problem , and it is increasingly clear that only global action can bring it under control .
an international agreement covering all major em@@ it@@ ters is now needed to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 .
the new agreement should build on the structures created by Kyoto but will have to be far more ambitious in order to limit global warming to 2 ° C.
the shift towards a low @@@ -@@ @ carbon global economy is a huge opportunity for business , especially in terms of technological innovation , which can drive economic growth and the creation of new jobs .
Europe is determined to take full advantage of this opportunity .
most of the technologies required to reduce emissions exist already or are well on the way to becoming operational .
what is needed now is support from major em@@ it@@ ters for a global climate agreement to ensure the deployment and further development of these technologies .
EU initiatives show the way ahead
at the same time , EU leaders committed to transforming Europe into a highly energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient , low @@@ -@@ @ carbon economy .
they underlined their determination to see the Union gain a " first mo@@ ver advantage " by committing the EU to cut emissions by at least 20 % of 1990 levels by 2020 , regardless of what action other countries take .
these emissions targets are underpinned by three energy @@@ -@@ @ related objectives , which are also to be met by 2020 :
after extensive economic analysis and consultation with Member States , the Commission in January 2008 put forward a major package of measures to implement these climate and renewable energy targets .
this initiative compl@@ ements ongoing work to improve energy efficiency .
EU leaders have expressed their wish to see the proposals become law by early 2009 .
this means that by 2020 , the number of emission allowances will be 21 % below 2005 levels .
once a global agreement has been reached , the EU cap will be automatically adjusted to a stricter reduction target as necessary .
the current system of having 27 national caps on emissions from the E@@ TS sectors will be replaced by a single EU @@@ -@@ @ wide cap .
the free allocation of emission allowances to businesses covered by the system will be progressively replaced by the auc@@ tioning of allowances from 2013 , reaching full auc@@ tioning by 2020 .
however , exceptions to this principle could be made for certain ener@@ gy@@ intensive industries if their competitiveness were judged to be at risk .
auc@@ tioning will raise considerable revenues for Member States , and the Commission suggests that at least 20 % of these should be ear@@ marked for combating climate change .
strengthening the EU E@@ TS through these changes will make it a more attractive partner for linking with similar cap @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ trade systems being developed elsewhere in the world at national and regional levels .
the development of a network of linked schemes will , in turn , strengthen the global carbon market .
tackling emissions from non @@@ -@@ @ E@@ TS sectors
sectors not covered by the expanded E@@ TS - such as transport ( except aviation ) , housing , agriculture and waste - will still account for almost 60 % of the EU 's overall emissions .
the Commission proposes that these non @@@ -@@ @ E@@ TS sectors should , collectively , cut their emissions by 10 % of 2005 levels by 2020 .
each Member State will make a fair contribution to this effort by meeting national emission targets that are differentiated according to its relative wealth ( measured by GDP per capita ) .
the national targets proposed range from a 20 % emissions reduction by the richest Member States ( Luxembourg , Denmark , Ireland ) to a 20 % emissions increase by the poorest one ( Bulgaria ) .
this approach means the less wealthy EU Member States will have room to continue growing their economies but will still need to keep their emissions below " business @@@ -@@ @ as @@@ -@@ @ usual " levels .
the proposals aim to ensure the EU delivers on its commitment to reduce emissions by at least 20 % of 1990 levels by 2020 .
in particular , substantially higher amounts of credits from emission @@@ -@@ @ saving projects in third countries would be accepted into the EU E@@ TS under an ambitious international agreement .
the package also sets out sustainability criteria that biofuels must meet to ensure they deliver real environmental benef@@ it@@ s. ts .
the European Commission plans to encourage the construction of 10 to 12 large @@@ -@@ @ scale demonstration plants in Europe by 2015 and to see CCS technology become commercially viable by around 2020 .
revised guidelines on state aid for environmental protection , also put forward as part of the package , will enable governments to support CCS demonstration plants .
it under@@ lines the EU 's leadership and shows that making the deep emissions cuts necessary to avert dangerous climate change is fully compatible with continued economic growth and prosperity .
its estimated costs are low , reducing the Union 's GDP growth by just 0.@@ 04 @@@ -@@ @ 0.@@ 06 % points per year between 2013 and 2020 .
• The Commission has proposed new transport fuel quality standards that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the production , transport and use of petrol and diesel by 10 % by 2020 .
other measures
this will help support the deployment of clean technologies as well as further strengthening knowledge of climate change and its impacts .
the EU is looking into possible policy measures , including trade @@@ -@@ @ related ones , to encourage other developed countries to take effective action to combat climate change .
statement by EU le@@ a@@ aders on post @@@ -@@ @ 2012 acc@@ tion , March 2007
EU heads of state and goo@@ vern@@ ment o@@ outlined the EU@@ U 's position on post @@@ -@@ @ 2012 global action to combat climate change at their E@@ Eu@@ uro@@ pe@@ an Council meeting in March 2007 .
the follow@@ wing are key extracts fro@@ m@@ their summit statement :
the European Council re@@ ea r@@ ms that absolute em@@ mission reductions are th@@ he backbone of a glob@@ al@@ carbon market .
in this context , the European Council endor@@ ses an EU objective of a 30 % reduction in greenhouse gas
the Europe@@ an@@ n Council stands ready to@@ continue and further stre@@ eng@@ then its support for de@@ ev@@ elop@@ ing countries in less@@ sen@@ ing their vulner@@ ab@@ ilit@@ y@@ and adapting to climate change . " C
besides helping to avert the most damaging impacts of global climate change , reducing greenhouse gas emissions will bring the EU a range of co @@@ -@@ @ benefits .
these include improving energy security , reducing air pollution and its associated health and control costs , and increasing employment .
security of supply is a growing concern as the EU becomes increasingly dependent on imported energy .
with " business as usual , " the Union 's energy import dependence will jump from 50 % of total Union energy consumption today to 65 % in 2030 .
reliance on imports of gas is expected to increase from 57 % to 84 % by 2030 , and of oil from 82 % to 93 % .
there is thus a very strong economic case for making more efficient use of resources , as a contribution towards improving EU competitiveness , even before the associated benefits of cutting emissions are taken into consideration .
with implementation of the January 2008 climate and energy package , the cost of oil and gas imports is expected to drop by around € 50 billion per year in 2020 .
this estimate is based on an oil price of US $ 61 per barrel , so if prices remain higher the saving will be larger .
reducing air pollution and health costs
cutting greenhouse gas emissions will also reduce air pollution , which still causes 37@@ 0,000 premature deaths in Europe every year .
the reduced need for measures to control air pollution will bring additional savings of € 11 billion per year in 2020 .
they employ some 3.4 million people in Europe and offer particular growth potential .
developed countries must continue to lead ...
developed countries are responsible for 75 % of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere today , excluding those from tropical deforestation .
these nations have the most financial resources and the greatest technological capacity to cut their emissions .
they should therefore be the ones to make the greatest effort to tackle climate change over the next decade .
the future agreement must contain binding rules for monitoring and enforcing the commitments undertaken .
in a competitive global market , every country needs to have the confidence that others are playing fair and living up to their pledges .
cutting costs through emissions trading
estimates show that emission trading systems can reduce the cost of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 75 % .
systems similar to that of the EU E@@ TS will be a key tool in enabling developed countries to meet their future commitments cost @@@ -@@ @ effectively .
improving and expanding this type of instrument will be crucial to future global action to combat climate change .
while the major effort to fight climate change in the immediate future must come from the developed nations , their actions alone will not be enough to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions .
( industry and energy , under business as usual scenario )
developing countries
developed countries
as developing countries expand their economies their emissions are increasing , and by 2020 these are projected to over@@ take total emissions from the developed world .
ending the destruction of tropical forests is also crucial .
this would also have important benefits for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development .
these actions are perfectly feasible without jeopar@@ dis@@ ing economic growth and poverty reduction .
just as measures to combat climate change will benefit Europe , they are also in the long @@@ -@@ @ term interest of less wealthy countries .
since vulnerable populations are the first to suffer the impact of floods , storms , droughts and the other effects of climate change , developing countries have every interest in joining the global effor@@ t. ort .
by 2020 , GDP is expected to double in China and India , and rise by 50 % in Brazil .
the European Commission estimates that taking action to cut emissions would s@@ have just 1 % off this GDP growth .
the EU recogn@@ ises that it has a heavy responsibility to support developing countries and help them combat and adapt to climate change .
the intention is to provide substantial resources to address climate change in the countries targeted .
these resources will be focused primarily on adaptation and disaster risk reduction , but the developing countries will also receive help to halt deforestation and participate in the global carbon market .
the EU will work together with these countries to integrate climate change fully into poverty @@@ -@@ @ reduction strategies .
many developing countries are already making efforts that are resulting in significant reductions in their emissions growth .
there are many policy options available to developing countries where the benefits outweigh the costs .
taking a new approach to the Clean Development Mechanism
the Kyoto Protocol 's Clean Development Mechanism ( CD@@ M ) should be streamlined and expanded .
the CD@@ M enables developed countries to off set their emissions by investing in emission @@@ -@@ @ saving projects in developing countries that yield emission credits .
in future , the CD@@ M will need to build on and support enhanced action by developing countries to mitigate their emissions .
the mechanism could be improved by expanding its scope and developing innovative mechanisms to cover entire national sectors rather than single projects as at present .
emission credits would be generated provided that a whole national sector bet@@ tered a pre @@@ -@@ @ defined emission standard .
this standard could vary according to the circumstances of different host countries .
since power plants remain in use for several decades , it is vital that they make use of state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art clean technologies that will minimise emissions .
this , however , will require an additional investment of some € 25 billion annually .
the earlier this gap can be filled , the less developing country emissions will grow .
GE@@ ER@@ EF will help to bring clean , secure and affordable energy supplies to some of the 1.6 billion people around the world who currently have no access to electricity .
it will do so by accelerating the transfer , development and deployment of environmentally sound energy technologies .
this will combat both climate change and air pollution , and could contribute to a more equitable distribution of Clean Development Mechanism projects in developing countries .
additional pledges from several European governments have taken the total to over € 110 million .
this funding is expected to mobil@@ ise additional risk capital of between € 300 million and € 1 billion in the longer term .
introducing sectoral emissions trading
another option is to introduce sector @@@ -@@ @ wide , company @@@ -@@ @ level emissions trading in industrial sectors in developing countries where the capacity exists to monitor emissions and ensure compliance .
this would be particularly appropriate for ener@@ gy@@ intensive sectors such as power generation , iron and steel , cement , oil refining , and pulp and paper .
such systems would be either global or national ; if the latter , systems in developing countries should be linked with those in developed countries , such as the EU E@@ TS .
targets for sectors covered would be strengthened gradually until they were similar to those set for the same sectors in developed countries .
taking on binding emission limits as development advances
as they reach a level of development similar to that of developed countries , developing nations should take on binding emission reduction commitments .
these should be tailored to their emissions levels and their own technical and financial capacities to limit and reduce them .
exemp@@ ting least developed countries from commitments
the least developed countries should not be subject to obligatory emission reductions because their level of emissions is low .
additional support will be required to allow the most vulnerable to adapt to climate change .
the EU and other developed countries should also help the least developed countries to increase the numbers of CD@@ M projects they host .
an international agreement on energy efficiency standards is needed with the active commitment of countries that manufacture appliances .
this will facilitate their access to global markets as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions .
adaptation to climate change
adaptation to climate change must be an integral part of the future agreement .
the particular vulnerability of developing countries to the adverse impacts of climate change means they must be supported in their efforts to develop national adaptation strategies .
this is especially necessary for the least developed countries , small island developing states and African countries prone to drought , deser@@ tification and floods .
the European Union is providing support through the UN 's climate funds , the CD@@ M and the G@@ C@@ CA ( see box on p . 18 ) .
adaptation to climate change needs to be taken into account in public and private investment decisions .
international co @@@ -@@ @ operation on technology development and transfer
further co @@@ -@@ @ operation in this field will help speed up the technological change needed to achieve a low @@@ -@@ @ carbon global economy .
international research co @@@ -@@ @ operation will increase understanding of the local and regional impacts of climate change and help develop ways to enable populations to combat and adapt to it .

international financial institutions play an important role in tackling environmental issues .
access by the Central Asian states to financial resources enables them to improve their infrastructure and allows for much investment , particularly in energy , industry and water supply infrastructure .
since the 1960s , its volume has decreased by 75 % .
the sho@@ rel@@ ine has rec@@ eded dramatically - by up to 120 km in places - and the water level has dropped by at least 16 metres .
combined with years of water shortage , increased irrigation from the upstream rivers of Am@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Dar@@ ya and Sy@@ r Dar@@ ya has led to irreversible consequences .
the biodiversity of the Aral Sea has been drastically reduced and the sal@@ inity of the water has increased , bringing down fish fertility .
jobs and food disappeared along with the sea : the fishing industry was ruined and poverty became more widespread .
meanwhile , dust and pollution blown from the deserted lake has caused an increase in cancer , and other illnesses linked to poverty , like an@@ a@@ emia or tuberculosis , are now ri@@ fe .
child mortality rates are al@@ arm@@ ingly high : the worst in the whole of the post @@@ -@@ @ Soviet territory .
the drying @@@ -@@ @ up of the lake also reportedly brought changes to the regional climate , with hot@@ ter and dri@@ er sum@@ mers and col@@ der w@@ inters .
this painful lesson illustrates how easy it is to destroy the nature around us .
the international community must realise that it is our responsibility to take timely preventive measures wherever the first signs of danger appear .
D@@ G Environment actively supports all endeav@@ ours to protect the environment in Central Asia .
central Asia - home to about 60 million people - needs our attention today more than ever .
the area is a testing ground for measures to reduce and remove environmental threats .
it also shows how inaction will always prove co@@ st@@ lier than mitigation and prevention .
although Central Asia may seem far away , we must keep in mind that the degradation of its environment will have a growing impact on Europe .

historically Central Asia is a gateway between Europe and the Far East .
central Asia is severely a@@ ected by climate change .
there are already increasing shortages of water .
within the last five decades , Tajik glaciers have lost a third of their area , while over 1000 glaciers have disappeared in Kyrgyz Republic .
water governance under the EU Water Initiative in Central Asia ; Investment in water supply and sanitation ;
the lack of drinking water has obvious consequences on the whole population , but water scarcity also generates tensions .
upstream countries ( Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic ) use water for hydropower generation and wish to keep the water dam@@ med during sum@@ mers to ensure a su@@ cient supply of electricity during winter .
meanwhile downstream countries ( Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan ) need vast quantities of water during the summer for agricultural purposes , especially for cotton .
old energy infrastructure , energy @@@ -@@ @ thir@@ sty industry , heavy industrial pollution and CO emissions worsen the overall environmental picture .
for instance , greenhouse gas emissions per capita in Kazakhstan h st an - Al m at a za k have now reached a level comparable to Germany .
the increasing exploitation of gas and oil represents an additional burden despite the huge potential of Central Asian states in renewable energies , particularly wind and solar energy .
it is implemented by the EECCA countries , EU Member States and European Commission in close cooperation with international organisations .
an EU @@@ -@@ @ Central Asia Joint Expert Working Group has been formally established and the first National Policy Dialogue ( N@@ PD ) on water issues launched in the Kyrgyz Republic .
in 2009 , N@@ PD@@ s should be launched in Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
the initial focus of better EU environmental cooperation with Central Asia is bound to be on water .
the need for an integrated approach to water management , including cross border river management , is broadly recognised .

today , just four years later , a range of genetic tests has been develop@@ ed@@ and the possibility of genetic testing is profoundly changing the methodologies and strate@@ gi@@ es@@ used in medical therapy and healthcare .
genetic testing will so@@ on@@ become part of everyday healthcare systems , and patients and professionals will have to lear@@ n@@ to make decisions on the need for a test as well as understanding its consequences .
when integrating these technologies into the healthcare system , it is important to implement the@@ ir@@ application within a responsible framework of accompanying measures and activities .
trust and@@ confidence should prevail when developing new testing capacities .
what has to be considered when creating such a frame of responsibilities ?
Wh@@ at@@ do decision @@@ -@@ @ makers need to understand and to do now in order to give these new techn@@ ologi@@ esa successful start as a powerful diagnostic and research and development tool ?
the EC Expert Group
the participants came from vari@@ ous@@ national backgrounds within Europe and numbers were well balanced between men and@@ women .
the discussion in the Group was both stimulating and@@ encouraging .
the 25 recommendations
the Expert Group shared the view that genetic testing represents progress in healthcare and an@@ opportunity with the potential to lead to developments in preventive medicine .
they recogn@@ is@@ ed@@ that there is no progress without cost and investment , and that all progress has both positive and@@ negative implications .
the conditions and context of the application of genetic testing ther@@ ef@@ ore@@ need assessment on a case @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ case basis to provide maximum benefit and minimum risk .

the definitions used by the Group can be found in Annex 2 of the report .
further issues are at stake with respect to non @@@ -@@ @ ger@@ minal ( som@@ atic ) testing that require more inde@@ p@@ th reflection and investigation .
see report , chapter 9.1 .
recommendation 2
that : A. a specific working group be set up to discuss further issues relevant to gene@@ tic@@ testing for acquired genetic properties .
genetic information is part of the entire spectrum of all health@@ information and does not represent a separate category as such .

predic@@ tive genetic testing has real potential to provide options for personal choice .
however , IT@@ IS imperative to recognise both the right to know and the right not to know as important individu@@ al@@ rights .
equitable access to information and to quality genetic services must be assured .
In@@ addition , measures must be taken to prevent undesirable societal consequences as a result of@@ genetic testing .

recommendation 6
genetic @@@ -@@ @ testing services in Europe , while based on high @@@ -@@ @ quality scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how , tend to suffer@@ from an intoler@@ ably high level of technical error and poor reporting .
this is caused by a lack of@@ both structuring and complement@@ arity at European level and by the absence of a common European objective to provide quality services to all its citizens now and in the future .
nevertheless , genetic servic@@ es@@ face an ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing number of requests for testing , while widespread suscep@@ tibility test@@ ing@@ and pharmac@@ ogen@@ etic tests are lur@@ king on the horizon .
in the context of human healthcare , a test should only be offered when it has been shown t@@ oper@@ form reliably and when there is a sound medical reason to consider it .
a system for th@@ ev@@ al@@ idation of tests should be established . see report , chapters 1.4 , 7.@@ 1.2 and 8.2 .
recommendation 7
there must be agreement between medical professionals , patients , and@@ the community that the benefits outweigh the risks .

10.@@ Data protection : confidentiality , privacy and autonomy
public concern regarding genetic testing is grounded to some extent in the fear of misuse of@@ genetic data and of inappropriate access to such data by third parties .
confidentiality and priv@@ ac@@ y@@ with regard to all personal medical data , including those derived from genetic testing , are bas@@ ic@@ rights and must be respected .
an individual 's right to determine the extent of privacy and@@ confidentiality that he or she will be afforded encompasses both access to personal inform@@ ation@@ and data and to tissue samples as carriers of information .
see report , chapters 3.2 , 4.1 and 7.@@ 2.2 .
recommendation 10
irrespective of confidentiality issues , personal medical data including genetic data must not be@@ used to discriminate un@@ fairly against individuals .
the Group acknowledges the risk of discrimin@@ ation@@ as a result of genetic testing but notes that the field of discrimination extends far beyond gene@@ tic@@ s.@@ S@@ uch discrimination may affect individuals , families or larger groups .
TH@@ E@@ 25 R@@ ECO@@ MM@@ END@@ ATIONS

the Group has considered bi@@ ob@@ ank collections to mean the biological sam@@ pl@@ es@@ themselves , plus the related databases , allowing a certain level of accessibility , availability and@@ exchange for scientific studies .
public trust in research surrounding genetic testing is larg@@ el@@ y@@ dependent on how the use of samples and data in and from such bi@@ ob@@ an@@ ks is undertaken and@@ communicated .

at the wider regional level ( I.@@ e. the Baltic region ) , there is a need to promote Inter@@ state and Inter@@ regional cooperation with a view to assisting the development of the Northern Dimen@@ sion and moving towards enlargement .
in order to ensure that these technical aspects do not stand In the way of the development of common projects across the borders , the European Commission has already introduced a number of internal coordination measures between INTER@@ RE@@ G and T@@ ac@@ is .
for example , one of the criteria for the selection of T@@ ac@@ is C@@ BC projects is the existence of a complementary INTER@@ RE@@ G project on the other side of the border .
already , there is evidence that this is working .
• The Kare@@ lian parks ;
• Development of monitoring , protection and sustainable use of Lake Lad@@ oga ;
• Development of J@@ ä@@ n@@ ls@@ jo@@ ki for tourism purposes .
the INTER@@ RE@@ G Guidelines of April 2000 , setting out the rules for 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 , commit the Commission to making progress on this Issu@@ e .
the Northern Dimen@@ sion
the focus of INTER@@ RE@@ G and T@@ AD@@ S coordination Is not only on the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russian land border .
it Is equally Import@@ ant to emphasi@@ se cooperation within the wider Baltic Sea region , and in particular with Kaliningrad .
a Northern Dimen@@ sion Action Plan , proposed by the European Commission , was approved at the European Council meeting at Fel@@ ra in June 2000 .
the Northern Dimen@@ sion al@@ ms to provide added value through reinforced coordination and complement@@ arity in European Union and Member States ' programmes and enhanced collaboration between countries in Northern Europe .
the Commission wishes to encourage the participation of Kaliningrad in cooperation actions In the Baltic Sea region .
Kaliningrad lies within the zone identified In the context of the INTER@@ RE@@ G transnational programme for the Baltic Sea region .
as described below , transnational co operation has a wider scope than cross@@ border co operation and is more suited to the maritime dimension of the Baltic Sea area .
in January 2001 , the Commission Issu@@ ed a communication on Kaliningrad and Its future relation ship with the European Union .
the document ¡ s a discussion paper In@@ tended to encourage thinking on how to assist the development of the region In the framework of enhanced cooperation between Russia and the European Union .
cross@@ border cooperation mostly concerns those regions which are located on the land borders of the European Union .
a limited number of maritime borders In close proximity are also Inclu@@ ded .
the INTER@@ RE@@ G Community Initiative Is part of the European Union 's regional policy .
the funding for INTER@@ RE@@ G III ( the latest phase of INTER@@ RE@@ G ) comes from the European Regional Development Fund , one of the Struc@@ tural Fun@@ ds .
a total of 4.@@ 8@@ 75 billion € is available for the period 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 .
Inter@@ re@@ g III is split into three str@@ ands , namely cross@@ border ( A ) , transnational ( B ) and Inter@@ regional cooperation ( C ) .
transnational cooperation seeks to promote wider scale cooperation across national frontiers and as such It is not limited to con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous border areas .
it is not possible , however , at this stage to provide the definitive overview of the relevant INTER@@ RE@@ G programmes .
• Transport and Communication .
the South @@@ -@@ @ East Finland INTER@@ RE@@ G Programme ( € 22 million ) focuses on :
• the development of transport links and the state of the environment ;
following negotiation between the European Commission and the Member States and the part ­ nership , the programmes are approved by the Commission .
• the development of business and the business environment ;
str@@ and Β therefore focuses on matters such as transport , environmental Issues and spatial planning .
in the North Cal@@ ot@@ te / Kol@@ arc@@ tic INTER@@ RE@@ G M@@ IA programme ( € 47 million ) , the Kol@@ arc@@ tl@@ c part of the programme focuses on co ­ operation with Russia ( the Nord@@ kal@@ ot@@ ten part dealing with ¡ n@@ tra ­ Scandinavian co ­ operation . )
the Baltic Sea INTER@@ RE@@ G 1@@ MB Programme ( € 97 million ) contains the following priorities :
• Promotion of Institution building , strengthening transnational spatial development .
the T@@ AD@@ S programme links the EU to thirteen partner States in Eastern Europe and Central Asia .
the new T@@ AD@@ S regulation provides for the selection of a smaller number of larger projects .
the amount envisaged for the implementation of the T@@ AD@@ S programme over the 2000 to 2006 period Is € 3.@@ 138 billion .
• 40 @@@ -@@ @ 50 % for development of infrastructure networks ( border cross@@ ings ) 1 ;
• 15 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % for promotion of environmental protection and the management of natural resources ;
• 15 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % for support to the private sector and assistance for economic development ;
• 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % for small projects .
the allocation for the year 2001 was € 23 million .
• assisting border regions in overcoming their specific developmental problems ;
the Indic@@ ative Programme proposes to provide around € 30 million per annum .
• encouraging the linking of networks on both sides of the border , e.g. border @@@ -@@ @ crossing facilities ;
1 A study of border cross@@ ings in the T@@ AD@@ S area was made to identify projects for European Union funding .
this 1995 / 96 study is currently being updated .
an analysis will be made to reconsider the ranking of border cross@@ ings for which available support can be most appropriately used to improve traffic flows .
the T@@ AD@@ S projects are classified into two different types , based on the cost of the project .
although the T@@ ac@@ is C@@ BC programme Is the T@@ ac@@ is programme which can most obviously benefit from Im@@ proved coordination with INTER@@ RE@@ G , It is not the only one .
the T@@ ac@@ is national programme for Russia supports projects across Russia , some of which can be located in border areas .
in addition , there ¡ s a Baltic Special Facility which has a separate budget line .
it Is jointly managed by PH@@ ARE and T@@ ac@@ is according to C@@ BC rules .
the T@@ AD@@ S component will focus on border cross@@ ings and on health care .
in the case of cross@@ border cooperation the projects may be proposed through the T@@ AD@@ S Local Support Offices .
there is one in St. Petersburg with branches in Petro@@ z@@ avo@@ dsk and in Kaliningrad .
the European Commission Delegation Is associated with the programming .
local and regional authorities are the main groups concerned .
project proposals are submitted directly to the Europe@@ Aid service of the European Commission , which then selects the best projects once a year .
another relevant T@@ ac@@ is programme Is the Institution Building Partnership Programme ( IB@@ PP ) , which is part of each T@@ ac@@ is national programme .
T@@ AC@@ IS aspects
it is divided into actions dealing with INTER@@ RE@@ G issues , actions on T@@ ac@@ is Issues , and publicity actions relevant to both Instr@@ uments .
• The selection criteria for INTER@@ RE@@ G projects In the relevant programmes must Inclu@@ de a reference to T@@ ac@@ is .
• INTER@@ RE@@ G application forms should Inclu@@ de a section to be completed on the coordination with a T@@ AD@@ S project , either a link to a larg@@ esc@@ ale project or a parallel application for a small project .
this will allow priority to be given to various projects during the T@@ AD@@ S selection process .
PH@@ ARE aspects
conclusion
the Commission under@@ lines that , although the improvements it Is putting In place will Im@@ prove the possibilities of coordination between INTER@@ RE@@ G and T@@ AD@@ S , the actual coordination It@@ self must come from project applicants .
the Commission can set up a framework and encourage cooperation - only the authorities and organisations on the ground can actually ensure that the coordination leads to concrete results .
the Commission believes that this is an important further step in the Im@@ proved coordination of INTER@@ RE@@ G and T@@ AD@@ S .
further work , enlar@@ ging the scope of the exercise , will continue .
how to prepare and submit an INTER@@ RE@@ G project
the Commission organ@@ ises a call for proposals every year for the small project facility .
this will set out the subjects to be covered by projects , who can submit projects , and , particularly Import@@ ant , the closing date for project submission .
the first step in preparing an INTER@@ RE@@ G project Is to contact the INTER@@ RE@@ G secretariat for the programme which covers the location of the project .
the secretariat Is the contact point for the programme . it deals with the practical arrangements of the programme , such as receiving and assessing projects .
they can also provide useful advice to people preparing projects .
applicants must complete the project application form and submit it directly to the Commission .
the T@@ AD@@ S application should be completed In parallel with the INTER@@ RE@@ G application described in the previous section . in this way , there should be coherence between the two forms .
a project proposal Is made by completing a project application form , which Is available for each programme .
in the case of INTER@@ RE@@ G @@@ -@@ @ T@@ ac@@ ls co @@@ -@@ @ ordination , project proposals will have to describe the links they have with a parallel T@@ AD@@ S project .
the Commission will then organise an Internal evaluation committee to select the best projects for funding .
projects can normally be selected for approval , given conditional approval ( because some Information was missing , for example ) , recommended for revision or rejected .
conditional approval could also be used where a project 's parallel application under INTER@@ RE@@ G had not yet been approved .
after approval of the ( revised ) application , the applicant will sign a contract with the Commission for the use of the grant .
the contract fulfil@@ s the same role as the grant letter for an INTER@@ RE@@ G project .
the most suitable project proposals will be select ed by a Steering Committee , which consists of representatives of the national , regional and local authorities and other organisations .
the European Commission sits as an observer on the Committee .
projects can normally be selected for approval , given conditional approval ( because some Information was missing , for example ) , recommended for revision or rejected .
conditional approval could also be used where a project 's parallel application under T@@ AD@@ S had not yet been approved .

the European Union must aim for greater economic integration with its neighbours through an ambitious neighbourhood policy .
such integration requi@@ res@@ a more effective transport market .
how can we achieve a more effective transport market between the European Union and its neighbours ?
implementation of such measures will facilitate the spread of internal market principles in the field of transport to@@ countries neighbouring the European Union .
I was able to bring this work to a successful conclusion thanks to the efforts of the high @@@ -@@ @ level group chaired by Lo@@ y@@ ol@@ ade Pal@@ aci@@ o .
the group brought together representatives of the EU Member States and 26 neighbouring countries fro@@ me@@ astern Europe , the Balkans , the Caucasus region and the entire Mediterranean rim .
to put this ambitious policy into practice , we need solid coordination structures that guarantee a strong commitment by the stakeholders , both Member States and neighbouring countries alike .
all relevant financing sources , whether public or private , regional , national or international , will also have to be pool@@ ed .
the neighbourhood investment fund will be the ideal mechanism to encourage investments in transport and to make the attainment of the@@ objectives set by the Communication possible .
this range of measures , ambitious but achievable , will give new impetus to economic integration between the European Union and its neighbours .
it will also help promote regional cooperation between them .
thanks to impro@@ v@@ ed@@ transport axes , we will develop closer relations with our neighbours while stimulating trade and tourism .

this means looking at key transport axes - co@@ rec@@ ross @@@ -@@ @ continental routes - to ensure efficient flows of traff@@ ic@@ and goods .
the TE@@ N @@@ -@@ @ T policy does not , therefore , address transport connections between the EU and the neighbouring countries or other trade partners .
several important transport routes across central , eastern and@@ south @@@ -@@ @ eastern Europe - known as pan @@@ -@@ @ European corridors - were developed from the early 1990s .

the five axes were chosen because they will contribute most to promoting international exchanges , trade and traffic .
the " motor@@ ways of the Sea " concept envisages amongst other@@ things an extension through one of the most strategically important shipping routes in the world , the Su@@ ez Canal .
links to the@@ energy @@@ -@@ @ rich Caspian and even a connection from Ukraine to Russia 's epic trans @@@ -@@ @ Siberian railway are also foreseen among the axes .
master plans should be developed for these five axes - pl@@ ans@@ that should be subject to strategic economic , environmental and@@ social impact assessment .
this in turn would provide the ba@@ sis@@ for selecting specific infrastructure projects .

grants must be requested from the cultural and scientific advisors at the French embassy or consul@@ ate in your country .
grants are awarded via the Services de cooperation et d '@@ action cul@@ tu@@ rel@@ le ( SC@@ AC ) of the French embassies abroad .
they are merit @@@ -@@ @ based and awarded according to criteria established in specific agreements with the country of origin .
generally , these grants are only awarded to French students less than 28 years old when they make their first request .
however , exemptions exist for students who have been living in France for at least two years and who have filed their tax returns in France for the same period .
technical and scientific research grants are reserved for French students or students from the EU .
however , an exemption is possible for foreign students who have completed their post@@ graduate studies in France .
candidates must be presented by the professors of the post@@ graduate cycle .
students with a grant sign a contract for one to three years that may be extended by 6 to 12 months .
like French students , foreign students have access to the F@@ onds National d 'A@@ ide d '@@ urgence ( F@@ N@@ AU - National Emergency Gran@@ ts Fun@@ ds ) .

University departments offer the following study courses : medicine , science , engineering , arts and humanities , law , theology , economics and social sciences , and agriculture and forestry .
originally , as the name implies , technical universities restricted their teaching to technical and engineering disciplines .
however , over the years , they have developed into more comprehensive higher education institutions . hence , students can now also take arts and humanities degree courses at technical universities .
the education and training provided by colleges of art and music in Germany aim to prepare students for careers as professional artists or musicians , as well as teachers in artistic subjects .
courses at a college of music or art differ substantially from those at a university .
in general , however , teacher training has been integrated into the university structure .

the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) was developed in 2004 with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new@@ dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours and , instead , strengthening the prosperity , stability and security of all concerned .
the premise of the EN@@ P is that the EU has a vital interest in seeing greater economic development and better governance in its neighbourhood .
spreading peace and prosperity across the borders of the EU prevents artificial divisions and creates benefits for the EN@@ P partners and the EU alike .
the N@@ IF is one of the tools introduced in the framework of the EN@@ P to strengthen EU support to the economic development of its neighbours .
private investment flows to most countries of the neighbourhood region remain insufficient compared to global needs .
the capacity to finance crucial infrastructure is also insufficient in neighbourhood countries .

the European Union 's external relations
the EU 's global role
eradicating poverty through sustainable development
humanitarian aid
the Palestinian Authority and is contributing one billion euro to reconstruction in Afghanistan .
in the western Balkans and central Africa in 2003 , the EU embarked on the first mission@@ s@@ under its new European defence and@@ security policy . more will follow .
for more than 40 years , the Cold War@@ divided much of the world into tw@@ oc@@ amps .
its ending led to a more complex and fragile world order , requ@@ ir@@ ing@@ greater EU involvement in prevent@@ ing@@ conflicts , keeping the peace and combating terrorism .
who gives what : official development aid 2002 from OECD countries
14 % Japan
10 % Other donors
56 % EU and member states
source : OECD .
a world@@ player programmes .
moreover , in 2003 , the EU@@ decided that all new agreements mu@@ st@@ include a clause in which its partner@@ s@@ commit themselves to the non @@@ -@@ @ prolif@@ er @@@ -@@ @ ation of weapons of mass destruction .
The@@ underlying purpose is always to support sustainable growth and development in the partner countries , so th@@ at@@ they have the resources to tackle an@@ der@@ ad@@ icate poverty .
more than trade and aid
the EU has to make sure that the different aspects of its external pol@@ ici@@ es@@ are consistent with each other and convey a clear overall message .
to help@@ achieve this , it appointed a High Representative for foreign and security policy in 1999 .
in June 2004 , EU lead@@ ers@@ agreed in principle to create the post@@ of EU foreign minister .
this is one of then@@ ew arrangements laid down in the EU@@ Constitutional Treaty .
Prog@@ res@@ sover the years has been slow , but@@ steady .
in the last 15 years , the Union h@@ as@@ intensified efforts to play an international political and security role more@@ in line with its economic status .
Th@@ econ@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts that erupted in Europe after@@ the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 convinced EU leaders of the need fore@@ ff@@ ective joint action .
more recently , the fight against international terrorism has strengthened this conviction .
EU countries produced joint statements whenever the@@ y@@ could .
the principle of a Common Fore@@ ign@@ and Security Policy ( C@@ FS@@ P ) was form@@ alised in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht .
in December 1997 , in the Canadian capital of Ottawa , 1@@ 22 nations signed the M@@ ine Ban Treaty .
international anti @@@ -@@ @ mine action helps to promote global peace and stability and lessen human suffering in@@ mine @@@ -@@ @ affected regions .
it continues to be a top priority for the European Union , which contributed 40 million to this effort in the years 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2002 alone .
D@@ esp@@ ite@@ their commitment to the C@@ FS@@ P , member@@ governments sometimes find it hard to@@ change their own national policy in then@@ ame of EU solidarity .
at a summit meeting in Dec@@ em@@ ber@@ 2003 , EU leaders adopted a Europe@@ an@@ security strategy .
this recogn@@ ises th@@ at@@ citizens in Europe and elsewhere fac@@ e@@ potential threats from terrorism , th@@ es@@ pread of weapons of mass destruc@@ tion@@ and illegal immigration .
each kind of@@ threat needs an appropriate response , often requiring international cooperation .
prevention is better than cure
but it also employs new@@ tools provided by the ES@@ DP such as gathering information and monitoring international agreements to anticipate potential conflicts .
the EU 's trade policy is closely link@@ ed@@ to its development policy .
it has long recognised that trade can@@ boost the economic growth and productive capacities of poor nations .
A@@ se@@ arly as 1971 , under its " gener@@ al@@ is@@ ed@@ system of preferences " ( G@@ SP ) , the EU@@ began reducing or removing tariffs and@@ quotas on its imports from develop@@ ing@@ countries .
trade rules are multilateral , but trade@@ itself is bilateral - between buyers and@@ sellers , exporters and importers .
this is essential in@@ enabling countries to integrate into the@@ global economy and achieve sustainable growth and development .
the ultimate objective of EU policy is@@ to give people in less advanced countries control over their own development .
EU@@ initiatives also aim at eradicating diseases and providing access to che@@ ap@@ medicines to combat scour@@ ges like HIV / AIDS .
the EU also seeks to cut the@@ debt burden on poor countries .
echo does not have the resources to@@ do all this work itself .
EU member states strongly endorse the millennium development goals adopted by the United Nations in September 2000 :
the EU as an organisation seeks to support these goals by focusing on six priority areas where it can use@@ its special expertise .
with its biggest neighbour , Russia , the EU is developing a wholes@@ chem@@ e for cooperation in a broad@@ range of areas .
these countries also benefit from the EU 's T@@ AC@@ IS assistance program@@ me@@ which is worth 3.@@ 14 billion in the@@ period 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 .
it funds projects on@@ institutional reform , infrastructure networks , private sector development , environmental protection and the r@@ ur@@ al@@ economy .
as part of the " Barcelona Process , " the EU is committed to setting up a fre@@ e@@ trade area with its Med@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an@@ neighbours by 2010 .
this w@@ oul@@ d@@ include the Arab countries around th@@ es@@ ou@@ thern and eastern Med@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an@@ plus Israel and the Palestinian Territories .
the transatlantic partnership with the United States is central to the EU 's external relations .
given the size of their bilateral trade ( the US takes 25 % of EU exports and supplies 20 % of its imports ) , it is not surprising that disputes break out between the two from time to time .
although these disput@@ es@@ make the headlines , they represent less than 2 % of total transatlantic trade .
with Canada , the EU launched two ground @@@ -@@ @ breaking initiatives in 2004 to deepen relations .
one is to create an EU @@@ -@@ @ Canada partnership agenda for cooperation on global issues .
the other is to negotiate anew agreement for enhancing trade and investment between them .
Singapore : a gateway to@@ business in Asia .
Asia moves closer and the largest recipient of Jap@@ anes@@ ef@@ ore@@ ign investment , sur@@ passing the United States and China .
in recent years the EU has intensi@@ fi@@ ed@@ its relations with Japan .
this includes conflict prevention and@@ resolution and EU support for AU and United Nations peacekeeping effor@@ t@@ son the continent .
the European Uni@@ on@@ already has association agreements ( including free trade arrangements ) with Mexico and Chile , which wer@@ e@@ signed in 1997 and 2002 respectively .

joint Projects include small scale and short duration mobility activities for students , academic sta , researchers , university administrators and enterprise .
what DO@@ ES TE@@ MP@@ US DO ?
the aim of the European Higher Education Area is to provide citizens with choices from a wide and transparent range of high quality courses , with the benefit of smoo@@ ther recognition procedures too .
joint Projects are based on multilateral partnerships between higher education institutions in the EU and the partner countries . joint Projects can :
� develop , modern@@ ise and disseminate new curricula , teaching methods or materials ;
in particular , Europe 's universities must face the challenges of globalisation , and reforms are needed to release their full potential to help create more growth and jobs and make Europe 's knowledge @@@ -@@ @ based society a reality .
scholarships / fel@@ low@@ ships are open to higher education students and academics from all over the world .
programmes include obligatory study and research periods , in at least two universities , and award recognised double , multiple or joint degrees .
if you bring in meat or dairy products from outside the EU , you risk importing animal diseases .
if you do not declare such items , you@@ may be H n e d or face criminal prosecution .
these products will be seized and destroyed on arrival .
however , you@@ may bring in small quantities for personal consumption from Andorra , Croatia , the Fa@@ ero@@ e Islands , Greenland , Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway , San Marino and Switzerland
Islands , Greenland ,
consumers are exposed to pesticides because small amounts can be found on harvested crops .
these amounts are called pesti@@ cide resi@@ dues .
in the EU , from September 2008 onwards , a new Regul@@ ation@@ 1 comes into force which lays down revised rules for pesti@@ cide resi@@ dues .
in the European Union no plant protection products can be used unless it has first been scientifically established that :
the yield of agricultural and hor@@ ticul@@ tural crops can be severely reduced as a result of inf@@ est@@ ation by pests and diseases .
in order to protect crops before and after harvest , plant protection products are used .
they do not provoke unacceptable effects on the environment ;
they are sufficiently effective .
the amounts of resi@@ dues found in food must be safe for consumers and must be as low as possible .
a maximum resi@@ due level ( M@@ R@@ L ) is the highest level of a pesti@@ cide resi@@ due that is legally tolerated in or on food or feed .
the European Commission fixes M@@ R@@ Ls for all food and animal feed .
the M@@ R@@ Ls for all crops and all pesticides can be found in the M@@ R@@ L database on the Commission website .
for traders and importers , having to deal with 27 lists of national M@@ R@@ Ls led to confusion about which M@@ R@@ L they had to respect .
the rules applicable before 1 September 2008 were complex .
for some pesticides , the Commission would set M@@ R@@ Ls , for others , Member States were responsible .
for some pesticides , the Commission could set M@@ R@@ Ls , but the Member States could fix higher M@@ R@@ Ls .
and for some pesticides , no M@@ R@@ Ls were set at all .
toxicity of the pesti@@ cide , the maximum levels expected on food and the different diets of European consumers .
the new Regulation covers all agricultural products intended for food or animal feed .
M@@ R@@ Ls for 3@@ 15 fresh products are listed , but these M@@ R@@ Ls also apply to the same products after processing , adjusted to take account of dil@@ ution or concentration during the process .
the Regulation clearly design@@ ates the role of the Member States , EF@@ SA and the Commission in the setting of M@@ R@@ Ls and contains :
the EU M@@ R@@ Ls ( about 4@@ 5,000 ) already in force before September 2008 ;
the Regulation covers pesticides currently or formerly used in agriculture in or outside the EU ( around 1100 ) .
where a pesti@@ cide is not specifically mentioned , a general default M@@ R@@ L of 0.@@ 01 mg / kg applies .
the recently harmon@@ ised M@@ R@@ Ls previously set by the Member States ( about 100,000 ) ;
a list of low risk substances for which M@@ R@@ Ls are not necessary .
the European Food Safety Authority ( EF@@ SA ) then veri@@ fies that this resi@@ due is safe for all European consumer groups , including vulnerable groups such as babies , children and veget@@ arians .
when there is a risk established for any consumer group , the M@@ R@@ L application will be rejected and the pesti@@ cide may not be used on that crop .
in many cases the amount of pesti@@ cide needed is much lower than the highest level that is still considered safe .
in such cases the M@@ R@@ L is set at the lower level , thus ensuring that only the necessary ( minimum ) amount of pesti@@ cide is used .
how and when the pesti@@ cide may be used is defined by the relevant national authority and can be found on the label of the pesti@@ cide .
author@@ isations are granted on a national basis because the local and environmental conditions and the occurrence of pests ( and therefore uses of pesticides ) may differ .
for example , in the southern Member States where it is warmer , there are more insects and thus more insectici@@ des are needed .
in other parts of the EU , it is more hum@@ id - conditions that suit fun@@ gal inf@@ est@@ ation , and thus more fun@@ g@@ ic@@ ides are needed .
when M@@ R@@ Ls are set these differences should be taken into account .
for crops grown outside the European Union , M@@ R@@ Ls are set on request of the exporting country .
farmers , traders and importers are responsible for food safety , which includes compliance with M@@ R@@ Ls .
member State authorities are responsible for control and enforcement of the M@@ R@@ Ls .
to ensure that this is done in an adequate and uniform way , the Commission has three instruments :
the co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ated EU multi @@@ -@@ @ annual control programme sets out for each Member State the main pesti@@ cide @@@ -@@ @ crop combinations to monitor and the minimum numbers of samples to take .
member States have to report the results , which are published in an annual report .
community Reference Labor@@ atories co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ate , train staff , develop methods of analysis and organise tests to evaluate the skills of the different national control laboratories .
the Food and Veter@@ inary Office of the Commission carries out inspections in the Member States to assess and audit their control activities .
in 2006 the Commission made two legal proposals which are currently being discussed by the European Parliament and the Council :
in 2006 , the European Commission proposed a strategy to improve the way pesticides are used across the EU .

Europe and Russia : building a Strategic Partnership
the Russian Federation is one of the most important partners for the European Union .
a key priority of the European Union is to build a strong strategic partnership with Russia based on a solid foundation of mutual respect .
Russia is the largest neighbour of the EU , brought even closer by the Union 's 2004 and 2007 enlarg@@ ements .
the 2003 EU Security Strategy highlights Russia as a key player in geo @@@ -@@ @ political and security terms at both the global and regional level .
Russia 's contribution to Europe 's cultural heritage is an important element of our common ties .
Russia is also a major supplier of energy products to the EU .
Russia is a large , dynamic market for EU goods and services , with considerable economic growth .
Russia and the EU Member States are all members of the United Nations , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the Council of Europe .
they are all committed to upholding and respecting the fundamental values and principles of democracy , human rights , the rule of law and the market economy .
these values underpin the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia bilateral relationship and its legal basis , the Partnership and Cooperation European AG@@ S ying in front of St. B@@ asil 's Cathedral on Agreement .
the EU has a strong interest in working together with Russia Red Squ@@ are@@ to foster political , social and economic stability , in the region and worldwide .
Russia and the EU need to work together to combat new threats to security , as terrorism , crime , illegal migration and tr@@ af@@ icking in people as well as drugs .
the Russian Federation is also a crucial partner in combating climate change .
the EU and Russia are already cooperating in many ways , including the modernisation of Russia 's economy and its integration into the world economy , security , international issues and cooperation in the common neighbourhood of Eastern Europe .
Russian President Vladimir Putin 's in a letter to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the European Union , 25 March 2007
the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PC@@ A )
it sets the principal common objectives , establishes the institutional framework for bilateral contacts , and calls for activities and dialogue in a number of areas .
the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is based upon the following principles and objectives : the promotion of international peace and security ; support for democratic norms as well as for political and economic freedoms .
it is based on the idea of mutual partnership - one aimed at strengthening political , commercial , economic , and cultural ties .
the PC@@ A establishes an institutional framework for regular consultations between the European Union and the Russian Federation as follows :
• At Sum@@ mits of Heads of State / Heads of Government , which take place twice a year and define the strategic direction for the development of EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations .
• At Ministerial level in the Permanent Partnership Council ( P@@ PC ) , to allow Ministers responsible for various policy areas to meet as often as necessary and to discuss SP@@ E @@@ -@@ @ CI c issues .
P@@ PCs have so far been held with the participation of Foreign Ministers , Justice and Home Affairs Ministers , Energy , Transport and Environment Ministers .
• At senior of@@ ici@@ als and expert level .
the EU Tro@@ ika includes of@@ ici@@ als from the EU Member State that holds the EU Presidency , the incoming EU Presidency , the European Commission and the EU Council Secretariat .
experts from around 10 particular Council ( http : / / u@@ e.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ) working groups also meet with their Russian counterparts twice a year .
• Between the European Parliament and the Russian Parliament ( State Duma and Federation Council ) in the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee .
members from both Parliam@@ ents meet on a regular basis and exchange views on cur@@ - rent issues .
to complement the provisions of the PC@@ A , a number of sectoral and international agreements exist , as well as other mechanisms for cooperation ( see section below ) .
steel and textiles are the main sectors covered by bilateral trade agreements .
the latest Steel Agreement covers the years 2007 to 2008 .
the agreement will end on the day Russia becomes a member of the WTO .
• In November 2002 , recogn@@ ising the great efforts that Russia has made in its transition to a fully @@@ -@@ @ fledged market economy , the EU granted " market economy status " to Russian exporters .
it should be noted that anti @@@ -@@ @ dumping is not a major aspect in EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia trade at present , as only 10 anti @@@ -@@ @ dumping measures are currently in force , representing less than 0.5 % of EU imports from Russia .
2004 and negotiations at multilateral level are still ongoing .
the EU is currently working with Russia on a new agreement for post @@@ -@@ @ 2007 to replace the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PC@@ A ) .
both the EU and Russia have experienced many political , economic and social changes since the entry into force of the PC@@ A in 1997 , thus the new agreement must reflect these changes .
the aim of the new agreement will be to provide a durable and comprehensive framework for EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations based on respect for common values and will provide the basis for the relationship in the coming years .
Commissioner Ben@@ ita Ferr@@ ero @@@ -@@ @ Wal@@ d@@ ner and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov opening the European Studies Institute in Moscow , September 2006
at the St. Petersburg Summit in May 2003 , the EU and Russia agreed to reinforce their cooperation by creating in the long term four " common spaces " in the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and on the basis of common values and shared interests .
these common spaces are as follows
the Common Economic Space , covering economic issues and the environment ;
the Common Space of Freedom , Security and Justice ;
the Common Space of External Security , including crisis management and non @@@ -@@ @ pro @@@ -@@ @ liferation ;
the Common Space of Research and Education , including Cultural Asp@@ ects .
the Moscow Summit in May 2005 adopted Road Maps to act as the short and medi@@ um@@ term instruments for the implementation of the four Common Sp@@ aces .
these build on the on @@@ -@@ @ going cooperation as described above , set out further specific objectives , and specify the actions necessary to make the common spaces a reality .
they thereby determine the agenda for cooperation between the EU and Russia for the medi@@ um@@ term .
the Northern Dimen@@ sion and Cooperation with the Baltic Sea Region
in its scope , the N@@ D is increasingly focusing on North @@@ -@@ @ West Russia , forming the largest territory covered by this policy .
with the accession of two Black Sea lit@@ toral states , Bulgaria and Romania , to the EU on January 1 , 2007 , the prosperity , stability and security of our neighbours has become even more important .
cooperation will , where possible , take place within existing regional cooperation mechanisms ( such as the Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea aiming at environmental protection ) .
structural cooperation with the Black Sea Economic Community ( B@@ SEC ) will be strengthened .
the share of Russia in the EU 's total external trade in goods has nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006 .
in 2006 , Russia accounted for just over 6 % of EU exports and 10 % of EU imports , and was the EU 's third most important trading partner , after the USA and China .
the EU and Russia agreed at the St. Petersburg Summit in May 2003 to create in the long @@@ -@@ @ term a " Common Economic Space . "
a road map agreed in 2005 sets out objectives and areas for cooperation for the short and medi@@ um@@ term .
fourteen dialogues between the EU and Russia covering most economic sectors have so far been established .
they include a number of regulatory dialogues which aim at promoting the gradual approxim@@ ation of legislation .
this framework is complemented by sectoral agreements between both sides .
the aim is to put in place conditions which will :

the EU : a staun@@ ch supporter of Russia 's WTO accession
cooperation in this area aims at further integration of Russia into the world economy and at preparation for Russia 's accession to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) .
the EU recogn@@ ises the fundamental role that WTO membership plays in integrating Russia into the world economy and in anch@@ oring and consolidating Russia 's economic reforms .
advantages stemming from Russia 's accession to the WTO will be reciprocal .
it will provide more stability and predictability , better terms of access , increased legal security for EU investments in Russia .
Russian exporters will have guaranteed channels of exports to all EU markets and to other WTO members .
facilitating the Russian economic success story
these elements form the foundation of Russian competitiveness in international markets .
the European and Russian markets are fundamentally complementary : both the EU and Russia each have strengths that could be shared to mutual benefit .
in the eld of transport , the Council adopted negotiation directives for an Agreement on satellite navigation ( Gal@@ il@@ eo / GLO@@ NAS@@ S ) in 1999 .
a Fis@@ her@@ ies Agreement , aiming at deepening cooperation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic Sea , was signed in 2006 .
deep and comprehensive economic integration between the EU and Russia will allow us to fully exploit the potential of our partnership .
Commission President Jos@@ é Manuel Bar@@ roso at the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Summit in Helsinki on November 24 , 2006 .
energy is a very important element in the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relationship .
this relationship can be best characterised as mutual interdependence of supply , demand , investment and know @@@ -@@ @ how .
Russia is the world 's largest producer and exporter of natural gas and , together with Saudi Arabia , also the largest producer and exporter of oil .
Russia possesses more than 20 % of the world 's known gas reserves and 5 % of proven oil reserves .
the share of the energy and metals sector in the Russian economy is around 20 % while it employs only 2 % of the total labour force .
there is a strong mutual interest in a closer energy partnership between the EU and Russia - one that offers security and predictability for both sides .
the energy that the EU buys from Russia contributes very significantly to Russia 's current economic growth and the improved living conditions of its population .
in turn , the stable ow of reasonably priced energy remains an important motor for Europe 's economic growth .
ultimately , our citizens and businesses alike need to be provided with safe , reasonably priced energy .
further developing a dynamic energy relationship
Russia will remain an important supplier to the EU for years to come and has the potential to supply significant quantities of the additional energy resources that the EU might need to import in the medium term .
adequate investment in new capacity is required to extract and supply gas and oil .
considerable investments by European companies in the Russian energy sector were made soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
today , investments ow increasingly from Russian energy companies into the European Union .
to safeguard investments as well as trade , the EC engaged with Russia , as well as other key energy producers , to establish a comprehensive Energy Charter Treaty ( ECT ) .
action by the EU and governments is accompanied by cooperation among EU and Russian companies .
while Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty , it continues to af@@ ir@@ m that it intends to follow its key principles .
hence , it is the EU 's intention to have the ECT principles included in a forthcoming new agreement between EU and Russia .
the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Energy Dialogue , launched in 2000 , provides opportunities at both the political and expert level to foster cooperation and solve key problems .
the issues discussed include barriers to investments in terms of transparency , reciproc@@ ity and protection of investors in the energy sector ; as well as cooperation on new technologies and infrastructure projects .
particular attention is paid to energy ef@@ iciency and energy saving - an area that has vast potential for drastically reducing energy consumption in Russia .
EU Energy Commissioner Andr@@ is Pi@@ e@@ bal@@ gs at the International Energy Week in Moscow on October 31 , 2006 .
in addition , the EU wishes to resume discussions of the working group on the safety of the r@@ st generation nuclear reactors .
the Rome Summit in November 2003 decided on the renewal of the Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement , covering also nuclear Safety and Nuclear Fu@@ sion .
of unique importance : cooperation on climate change and the environment
the European Union works with very many countries to tackle environmental problems .
but cooperation on the environment and climate change between the EU and Russia is uniquely important .
the partnership is vital for the future of the environment at the global level , within the European continent , and at the local level where our borders meet - both on land and sea .
at a global level the commitment of the EU and Russia is essential for the success of efforts to combat climate change ; to promote sustainable use of forest resources ; to halt the decline of biological diversity ; and to reduce waste@@ ful use of energy resources .
Russia 's decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2005 was pivotal in bringing that agreement into force .
Russia 's implementation of the Kyoto exi@@ ble mechanisms will help to ensure that the Protocol achieves its objectives of combating global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
... that the energy and metals industry represents around 20 % of Russia 's GDP ?
the EU is the largest consumer of Russian energy products with 63 % of Russia 's oil exports and 65 % of its gas exports being exported to the EU .
Russia is the largest single external supplier of oil , accounting for 30 % of EU total imports or some 27 % of total EU oil consumption .
Russia also accounts for some 44 % of EU gas imports or around 24 % of total gas consumption .
with such an important mutual dependence having arisen regarding energy exports , it is easy to see why energy plays an important part in EU @@@ -@@ @ Russian relations .
freedom , Security , Justice and Human Rights
the EU and Russia agreed at the St. Petersburg Summit of May 2003 to create in the long @@@ -@@ @ term a " Common Space on Freedom , Security and Justice . "
a road map agreed in 2005 sets out the objectives and areas for cooperation in the short and medium term .
its gradual development takes place in the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement .
cooperation in this area has become a key component in the development of a strategic partnership with Russia .
the scope of our cooperation has gained tremendous importance with the expansion of our common borders after the last enlarg@@ ements of the EU .
our cooperation contributes to the objective of building a new Europe without dividing lines and facilitating travel between all Europeans while creating conditions for effectively ghting illegal migration .
moreover , the EU has a considerable interest in strengthening cooperation with Russia by jointly addressing common challenges such as organised crime , terrorism and other illegal activities of cross @@@ -@@ @ border nature .
our cooperation , carried out on the basis of common values such as democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , must reflect the necessary balance between Security , on the one hand , and Justice and Freedom , on the other .
in the area of Freedom , the development of visa policy brings tangible benefits to our citizens and improves people @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ people contacts .
the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia agreements on visa facilitation and read@@ mission have been concluded in early 2007 , entering into force on 1 June 2007 .
read@@ mission obligations , concerning the return of own nationals and third country nationals illegally residing in the territories of the EU Member States and Russia , are an important tool to prevent and tackle illegal immigration .
in the area of Security , ghting terrorism and organised crime is a key priority for cooperation .
the Commission uses political dialogue and technical assistance to help promote compliance with international law .
meetings between the EU Coun@@ ter Terrorism Coordinator and the Russian Special Presidential En@@ voy as well as at expert level enable exchanges of information and best practices .
the security part of the Common Space also provides for cooperation on e.g. document security as well as ght against money laundering , drugs , tr@@ af@@ icking in human beings and corruption .
strategic information . the agreement is instrumental to enhance our efforts to ght organised crime .
regular meetings of the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russian Li@@ aison O@@ fic@@ ers in the ght against organised crime take place in Moscow .
Russia has recently adopted a law on the protection of personal data .
ratification of the related Council of Europe Convention is a prerequisite for an additional and enhanced operational agreement between Russia and Euro@@ pol .
in the area of Justice , the EU supports judicial reform in Russia , notably in areas such as training of judges and the modernisation of the court system .
currently , the EU and Russia are also inform@@ ally exploring possibilities for judicial cooperation in civil matters .
as regards cooperation in criminal matters , Euro@@ just and Russia have recently launched negotiations on a cooperation agreement , which will enhance the parties " work against cross @@@ -@@ @ border crime .
with democracy , respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rule of law being at the very core of EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations , it is only natural that these issues are regularly discussed at all levels .
in 2005 regular , six @@@ -@@ @ monthly EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia human rights consultations were established .
they have provided for a substantial dialogue on human rights issues in Russia and the EU and on EU @@@ -@@ @ Russian cooperation on human rights issues in international for@@ a .
the EU also maintains a regular dialogue with both Russian and international NGOs on human rights issues .

foreign Policy Cooperation and External Security
the EU and Russia have agreed to reinforce their cooperation in the area of external security as they both have a particular responsibility for security and stability on the European continent and beyond .
there are 5 priority areas for enhancing EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia cooperation :
• Non @@@ -@@ @ proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery , strengthening export control regimes and disarmament
the EU and Russia work to strengthen the roles of the United Nations , OSCE and Council of Europe ( Co@@ E ) in building an international order based one ective multilateralism .
an extensive and ever more operational political dialogue character@@ ises EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations ( see above ) .
the EU has a strong interest in engaging Russia in strengthening stability on the European continent , notably in regions adjacent to EU and Russian borders - our common neighbourhood .
the regional conflicts in Moldova ( Transnistria ) and the South Caucasus ( Abkhazia , South Ossetia and Nagorno @@@ -@@ @ Karabakh ) are regularly discussed .
the EU also stresses the importance of promoting democracy in Belarus .
these discussions simultaneously grant both partners the opportunity to voice a frank exchange of views regarding the situation in the common neighbourhood and a platform to seek common solutions .
the EU in particular seeks an early n@@ alisation of the UN Comprehensive Convention against International Terrorism .
in the area of non @@@ -@@ @ proliferation , export controls and disarmament , a major objective of the EU and Russia is to promote the universal adherence to and greater effectiveness of the relevant international instruments .
since 1994 , some 60,000 experts have benefited from about 2100 proj@@ ec@@ s worth a total of $ 6@@ 35 million .
out of this gure the EU has contributed € 150 million to the IS@@ TC re@@ deployment effor@@ ts@@ . or@@ ts .
the EU contributes also to the G8 Global Partnership against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass De@@ struction .
at the G8 Summit in December 2003 former Commission President Pro@@ di committed € 1 billion over ten years as a contribution to the Partnership .
the EU commitment refers to the four areas of cooperation that have been identified : non @@@ -@@ @ proliferation , disarmament , counter @@@ -@@ @ ter @@@ -@@ @ r@@ or@@ ism and nuclear safety .
at the Seville European Council in 2002 , the EU defined the arrangements for Russian participation in EU crisis management operations .
Russia has however not accepted to participate in EU operations under these conditions .
in the eld of Civil Protection , the aim is to strengthen dialogue and cooperation to respond to disasters and emergencies .
an arrangement for practical cooperation was established in 2004 providing for exchanges of information , contact details for 24 @@@ -@@ @ hour communication and exchanges of sta between the operational centres .
research , Education and Culture
the EU and Russia have a strong and genuine interest to work together to foster political , social and economic stability in Russia , in the region and worldwide .
cooperation in research and development , education and culture should contribute to this objective .
at the St. Petersburg Summit in May 2003 , the EU and Russia agreed to set up a " Common Space of Research and Education , Inclu@@ ding Cultural Asp@@ ects . "
in the area of research and development the objective is to enhance EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia cooperation in mutually agreed priority elds and create favourable conditions , corresponding to the interests of both parties , aimed at
young Russians celebrating Europe Day 2007 in Moscow on Red Square
• introducing a credit system , aimed at practicing the European Credit Transfer System
• increasing the attractiveness of the higher education systems in Russia and in the EU .
in the area of culture there are three objectives :
• to develop cooperation between the cultural industries of the EU and Russia in order to increase both their cultural and economic impact .
cooperation in research and development , education and culture takes time to develop .
EU standards and practices . the Commission envisages a continuation of the T@@ emp@@ us programme in the period 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 .
a strong convergence of views and common approaches on the ratification and implementation of the UNESCO Convention on the protection and the promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions is being promoted .
this exhibition devoted to European history and the arts included major masterpieces from EU Member States and Russian collections .
the exhibition emphasi@@ sed the national identity , values and cultural traditions of each participating country and enhanced mutual understanding and cooperation between the EU and Russia .
EU Cooperation Program@@ mes and Projects
a programme of financial cooperation is being put in place - to be funded by both sides -@@ to foster and to strengthen the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia .
projects will be funded to the extent that they meet common political or policy priorities .
ideas for projects which will further the objectives identified in the road maps are expected to emerge from the Common Space dialogues .
financial cooperation with Russia began in the early 1990s , under the then T@@ AC@@ IS programme .
since 1991 , some € 2.7 billion of assistance was provided through the European Commission .
given the significant recent improvements in the Russian Federation 's s@@ cal position , the need for such broad ranging assistance has considerably diminished .
financial cooperation will now be carefully targeted to meet the objectives defined in the road maps to the Common Sp@@ aces .
in future EU financial cooperation with Russia is expected to be matched by the Federation .
the amounts made available by the Commission have been reduced accordingly .
but the total gure could rise to € 100@@ m depending on the level of Russian involvement in regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and other programmes .
funding is sourced in the main from the European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood and Partnership Instr@@ ument ( EN@@ PI ) .
priorities for cooperation , as described above , are set out in the national , regional and cross @@@ -@@ @ border indicative programmes for 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2010 , approved by EU Member States and agreed with the Russian Government .
they set out respectively allocations for cooperation with the Russian federal authorities , with a number of countries in the region and for cooperation between local authorities on either side of the Russia @@@ -@@ @ EU border .
such assistance focuses on the areas of design safety , operating and surveillance conditions and the overall organization of operational safety .
the programme has also supported the National Regul@@ atory Authority of Russia .
cooperation with Russia 's Regions
Kaliningrad recently celebrated its 7@@ 50th birthday and is amongst the great centres of European cultural history
the 2004 EU enlargement resulted in the Kaliningrad oblast of Russia becoming an ex@@ cl@@ ave surrounded by EU territory and bordering on Poland and Lithuania .
this led to an agreement between the EU and Russia on a facilitation transit regime for the movement of persons in 2003 .
the prosperity gap between Kaliningrad and the neighbouring regions is a further issue of concern , which has an impact on the socio @@@ -@@ @ economic situation on either side of the borders .
• to ensure that Kaliningrad region can benefit from and contribute to the sustainable development of the Baltic Sea region .
• to promote the socio @@@ -@@ @ economic development of Kaliningrad .
• to ensure the smooth and ef@@ ici@@ ent functioning of the transit of goods and persons between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia .
as regards transit between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia , steps are taken to improve the ef@@ iciency of border cross@@ ings and the socio @@@ -@@ @ economic development of the region .
customs authorities of Lithuania and Russia together with the Commission cooperate to make the transit arrangements function as smoothly as possible .
since 2004 , strong growth rates in transit volumes suggest that the arrangements work well .
Lithuania and Russia have acknowledged the good functioning of the facilitated transit regime of persons , which has entered into force in July 2003 .
the Commission issued a report in December 2006 , acknowledging that the transit regime works in a satisfactory manner .
further facilitating cross @@@ -@@ @ border movement between Kaliningrad and its neighbours , however , is called for .
border infrastructure has to be upgraded through in particular swift and ef@@ ici@@ ent implementation of the projects already agreed .
procedures have to be streamlined and simplified to eliminate long queues of lor@@ ries hin@@ dering movement between Kaliningrad and neighbouring regions of Poland and Lithuania .
steps are being made in this direction , yet the deepening of further cooperation remains of great importance .
Kaliningrad suffered a steep economic decline in the 1990s , with negative social consequences .
however , since 2001 economic growth in Kaliningrad has been faster than the Russian average .
it has become an important export hub for raw materials from Russia and an import centre for manufactured goods from the EU .
the new legislation is geared towards attracting investment in manufacturing industries .
whilst investment levels are still relatively low , there are some examples of successful foreign investments in Kaliningrad , such as the BMW car assembly plant .
for Kaliningrad , the EU has committed close to € 100 million for technical assistance in the periods 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 2003 and 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 .
another over € 50 million have been ear@@ marked for the period 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 .
projects cover institution building , energy , transport , enterprise restructuring , management training and environment .
• promotion of innovative small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized business activities , trade and invest@@ - ment , the improvement of energy distribution and its ef@@ ici@@ ent use at industrial and municipal levels , and the development of the administrative capacity of regional authorities . "
• Im@@ pro@@ vement of health indicators and vocational training .
the aid is aimed at supporting internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) and vulnerable groups in Chechnya , as well as IDPs in Ingushetia and Dagestan .
assistance is provided mostly in the following sectors : protection of the civilian population , shelter rehabilitation , income @@@ -@@ @ generation activities , health and psych@@ o @@@ -@@ @ social assistance . additionally , sup@@ -
however , although the conflict in Chechnya has rec@@ eded , the humanitarian situation in the region remains di@@ fic@@ ult .
some 150,000 people continue to be internally displaced within the Republic .
many of them are re@@ tur@@ nees who have come back from Ingushetia over the past few years but could not go home because their houses were destroyed during the conflict .
living conditions remain extremely di@@ fic@@ ult .
outside Chechnya , around 18@@ ,000 people are still displaced in Ingushetia and some 7,000 in Dagestan .
in parallel to a ph@@ asing down of humanitarian aid activities , the EU 's focus is shifting from purely humanitarian assistance to development programmes .
the EU has recently launched a new special programme for economic recovery of the North Caucasus with a budget of € 20 million for health , education and economic development .
there exists a clear mutual interest in the stability , and therefore the recovery and development , of the North Caucasus .
the EU stands ready to provide further support to the recovery programme put in place by the Russian Federation and regional governments for Chechnya and the surrounding region .

this brochure contains a number of documents that illustrate the recent developments in the political and security dialogue between the euro@@ pe@@ an union ( eu ) and Central Asia .
it focuses on the period after June 2007 , when the euro@@ pe@@ an union Central Asia Strategy for a new Partnership was adopted .
it marks an upgrade in the relations between the eu and Central Asia .
the eu has been engaged with the five countries in Central Asia from the very moment they gained their independence in the early 1990s .
by 2007 these relations had developed significantly and revealed clo@@ seness of values and of economic and security interests .

the eu Member States recognised that their bilateral relations would benefit from a coordinated , more focused common approach to the countries of Central Asia .
hence the adoption of the eu@@ Central Asia Strategy , which provided the necessary blend of interests and values .
it also took into account the specific@@ ities of the Central Asian countries and developed individual approaches to each of them , without leaving aside the regional cooperation .
as a next step , action @@@ -@@ @ oriented initiatives were developed in the priority areas , identified by the Strategy , such as : common security threats , rule of law , education , environment and water .
again , they combined the regional and bilateral approaches .
the documents that follow illustrate the latest political and security instruments developed in order to implement the eu Strategy .
the euro@@ pe@@ an union - Central Asia Strategy and its programmes provide a framework which combines all these instruments in a clear , coherent model and enables them to run in syner@@ gy .
the EU and Central Asia : strategy for a New Partnership
introduction : the EU and Central Asia
central Asia has a centuries @@@ -@@ @ old tradition of bringing euro@@ pe and Asia together .
it lies at a strategically important intersection between the two continents .
the Central Asia states of Kazakhstan , the Kyrgyz Republic , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and uz@@ be@@ k@@ istan have known considerable evolution in political and economic transformation since attaining independence .
they have established statehood , safe@@ guarded multi @@@ -@@ @ ethnic understanding and inter @@@ -@@ @ religious communication .
by joining the OSCE , they subscri@@ bed to the Organization 's values , standards and commitments .
by signing the united nations Millennium Declaration they set themselves ambitious goals .
at the beginning of the 21st century , the time has come for a new partnership between the eu and Central Asia states in a glob@@ alised world .
the common goal of achieving stability and prosperity by means of peaceful interaction makes euro@@ pe and Central Asia partners for increased cooperation .
the strong eu commitment towards its eastern neighbours within the framework of the euro@@ pe@@ an neighbourhood Policy will also bring euro@@ pe and Central Asia closer to each other , both in terms of political cooperation and economic development .
the development and consolidation of stable , just and open societies , adhering to international norms , is essential to bring the partnership between the euro@@ pe@@ an union and Central Asia states to full fru@@ ition .
good governance , the rule of law , human rights , democr@@ atisation , education and training are key areas where the eu is willing to share experience and expertise .
the eu can offer experience in regional integration leading to political stability and prosperity .
lessons learnt from the political and economic transformation of Central and eastern euro@@ pe can also be offered .
with their rich traditions and centuries @@@ -@@ @ old exchanges , the eu and Central Asia can contribute actively to the dialogue between civil@@ isations .
many challenges facing the glob@@ alised world affect euro@@ pe and Central Asia alike , and warrant a common response .
security questions and regional economic development require close cooperation of the eu with each Central Asian state , taking into account their geographical location , in particular with respect to Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iran .
this applies i.@@ a. to developments in the areas of border management , migration , the fight against organized crime and international terrorism , as well as human , drugs , and arms trafficking .
member States will support the Community 's programmes to contribute to a more coherent and visible eu policy in the region .
in order to address issues of particular importance , the eu will within the framework of this Strategy :
• start an " European Education Initiative " and support Central Asian countries in the development of an " e @@@ -@@ @ silk @@@ -@@ @ highway " ;
• establish a regular , result @@@ -@@ @ oriented " Human Rights Dialogue " with each of the Central Asia states ;
the eu has a strong interest in a peaceful , democratic and economically prosperous Central Asia .
these aims are interrelated .
the aim of the eu Strategy is therefore to actively cooperate with the Central Asia states in reaching these goals as well as to contribute to safeguarding peace and prosperity in neighbouring countries .
the Strategy builds on the progress which the Central Asia states have themselves made since attaining independence .
it takes account of their common aspects as well as specific national contexts and requirements .
it also builds on the results obtained under the implementation of the various Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements , eu assistance programmes and other initiatives taken by the eu to support the states of Central Asia .
the eu has an interest in security and stability as well as in adherence to human rights and the rule of law in Central Asia states because :
• strategic , political and economic developments as well as increasing trans @@@ -@@ @ regional challenges in Central Asia impact directly or indirectly on EU interests ;
• with EU enlargement , the inclusion of the Southern Caucasus into the euro@@ pe@@ an neighbourhood Policy and the Black Sea Sy@@ ner@@ gy Initiative , Central Asia and the EU are moving closer together ;
• significant energy resources in Central Asia and the region 's aim to diversify trade partners and supply routes can help meet eu energy security and supply needs .
cooperation with the un , in particular the ECE , the OSCE , the Venice Commission of the Council of euro@@ pe , NATO , international financial institutions and with other regional organisations and for@@ a will be enhanced .
the eu@@ SR , eu Member State embassies and the euro@@ pe@@ an Commission delegations should seek to strengthen cooperation with the OSCE .
in addition , the eu seeks to put into place , together with Central Asia states , new forms of cooperation , such as a regular bilateral human rights dialogue .
the eu@@ SR and the Commission as well as Member States play an important role in implementing this Strategy .
the eu@@ SR shall , on behalf of the High Representative and in accordance with his mandate , together with the ni on u op e an ur e ou NC il of the C
the Presid@@ ent@@ of Kazakhstan , Nursultan Nazarbayev and HR / SG J@@ avier Sol@@ ana , Brussels , 6 December 2006
Commission and the Presidency , and without prejudice to Community competence , monitor the implementation process , make recommendations and report to relevant Council bodies on a regular basis .
this policy will be intensified based on the experience gained .
public @@@ -@@ @ private partnership initiatives as well as bilateral instruments and Member State programmes can play an important role in increasing the eu 's commitment in Central Asia .
interaction with international financial institutions will be strengthened , including the World Bank and the euro@@ pe@@ an Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) .
the euro@@ pe@@ an Investment Bank ( EIB ) should play an important role in financing projects of interest to the eu in Central Asia .
bilateral and regional cooperation
the eu Strategy aims at a balanced bilateral and regional approach .
the eu will balance policy approaches in Central Asia according to the differing needs of every country and to the performance of each country .
the eu will foster regional cooperation among Central Asia states and between Central Asia states and other regions .
bilateral cooperation will be of special importance .
it will be strengthened to respond adequately to individual proposals brought forward by each of the five Central Asia states .
it is essential to cooperate bil@@ ater@@ ally on issues such as human rights , economic diversification , energy and other sectoral issues , including youth and education .
the intensity of the cooperation will reflect the commitment to transition and reform of each country .
in this regard the eu will cooperate with international financial institutions , multilateral and regional organisations and institutions .
the eu and Central Asia : strategy for a new Partnership
a strengthened EU approach
the development of a stable political framework and of functioning economic structures are dependent on respect for the rule of law , human rights , good governance and the development of transparent , democratic political structures .
cooperation on justice between the Central Asia states and the eu Member States will also be appropriate .
the eu will cooperate closely with the OSCE , the Council of euro@@ pe , the un and the un High Commissioner for Human Rights in this field .
independent media as a key indicator of democratization .
newspapers on sale in the street of the Tajik capital Dushanbe , December 2008
those dialogues are an instrument of the union 's external policy .
human rights dialogues constitute an essential part of the eu 's overall strategy aimed at promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , sustainable development , peace and stability .
the form and the mod@@ alities of such dialogue will be defined individually and at a future stage .
the objectives of a human rights dialogue with each of the countries of Central Asia should include :
the eu will respond to suggestions put forward by the Central Asia states and will further intensify cooperation on matters pertaining to the rule of law , good governance and combating corruption .
• support the transparent implementation of legal reform ;
• encourage implementation of ILO norms and conventions for decent work ;
• coordinate closely with existing activities of OSCE field missions , the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) , bilateral programmes as well as the un and the un High Commissioner for Human Rights ;
• and provide technical assistance and establish close cooperation aimed at making the legislative and constitutional amendments required for accession to and implementation of the Rome Statute .
the task of sustaining a culture of human rights and making democracy work for its citizens calls for the active involvement of civil society .
a developed and active civil society and independent media are vital for the development of a plur@@ alistic society .
the eu will cooperate with the Central Asia states to this end and promote enhanced exchanges in civil society .
the eu will also pursue its objectives of ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world , as well as in Central Asia states , through international bodies such as the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council as appropriate .
the eu is willing to cooperate with Central Asia states in these international for@@ a to achieve this common aim .
secondary education is among the areas supported by the European Education Initiative for Central Asia
investing in the future : youth and education
central Asia 's future will be shaped by its young people .
the majority of Central Asia 's population is under the age of 25 , providing enormous potential for development .
good education is essential in order to open up this potential for the younger generation .
the eu and Member States will therefore set up a euro@@ pe@@ an education Initiative for Central Asia in order to contribute to the adaptation of the education systems of Central Asia states to the needs of the glob@@ alised world .
it is willing to cooperate with major international partners and donors supporting educational programmes and institutions .
under the euro@@ pe@@ an education Initiative , the eu and Member States will in particular offer support in the fields of :
• primary school education ;
• higher education cooperation , academic and student exchanges , for instance under the new Er@@ as@@ mus M@@ und@@ us facility and T@@ emp@@ us and bil@@ ater@@ ally .
the eu will support the development of regional education centres and cooperate closely with the OSCE Academy in Bishkek .
the eu stands ready to open euro@@ pe@@ an Studies In@@ stitutes in the region .
the eu is prepared to grant scholarships for students from Central Asian countries to euro@@ pe@@ an universities .
the eu will also support the continuation of the activities performed by the euro@@ pe@@ an Training Foundation in the field of vocational education and training in Central Asia .
furthermore , the eu stands ready to support Central Asia states in linking with the eu e @@@ -@@ @ network through the development of an " e @@@ -@@ @ silk @@@ -@@ @ highway " and to promote long distance learning .
it is our aim to link Central Asia to global Internet @@@ -@@ @ based communication networks and to enable Central Asian students , teachers , academics , and scientists to participate in modern forms of life @@@ -@@ @ long learning .
promotion of economic development , trade and investment
WTO accession is key for wider economic reforms and diversification and better integration of the countries into the international trade and economic system .
the eu will promote the creation of regulatory and institutional frameworks for an improved business and investment environment and further support economic diversification .
the eu will continue to cooperate with Central Asia states in order to improve access for Central Asian products to eu markets .
N@@ i on u op e an ur e ou NC il of the C
as an important trade corridor between east and South Asia and euro@@ pe , Central Asia can benefit from increasing trade .
the eu will continue to support the development of market economy structures in Central Asia .
in this connection , the eu will cooperate with interested companies from the eu in a public @@@ -@@ @ private partnership to promote the market economy .
it will offer training and assistance programmes for Central Asian partners .
the eu will support the aspirations and actions of the Central Asia states towards market economy structures .
• support deeper integration of Central Asia into the world trade and economic system , in particular through the WTO accession process an@@ dev@@ ent@@ u@@ al@@ membership ;
the eu and Central Asia : strategy for a new Partnership
• study further possible options to enhance the Central Asia states " ability to make better use of the available G@@ SP and encourage regional trade ;
• continue to support the efforts of the Central Asia states to fully implement the trade and economic provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements ;
• extend trade @@@ -@@ @ related technical assistance and policy advice to facilitate the creation of legislative and institutional frameworks conducive to better business environments and to attracting foreign direc@@ t@@ investment ;
• support initiatives for know @@@ -@@ @ how transfer and capacity building .
the eu and Central Asia share a paramount interest in enhancing energy Security as an important aspect of global security .
there is a common interest in diversi@@ fying export routes , demand and supply structures and energy sources .
its potential has not been sufficiently addressed .
the development of resources in oil and gas has significantly increased the role of Central Asia states as energy producers and transit countries .
increasing oil and gas exploitation will contribute to better world market supplies and will be conducive to diversification .
gas deliveries from the region are of special importance to the eu .
the eu , for its part , is ready to consider all options for the development and transportation of these resources , in cooperation with other interested partners .
a market @@@ -@@ @ based approach to investment and procurement and transparent , stable and non @@@ -@@ @ discriminatory regulatory frameworks guarantee , for all sources of energy , the best prices and increased opportunities for all stake @@@ -@@ @ holders .

the eu will support the exploration of new oil , gas and hydropower resources and the upgrading of the existing energy infrastructure .
to enhance eu security of energy supply , the eu will also support the development of additional pipeline routes and energy transportation networks .
it will also contribute to regional energy security and cooperation , and widen export markets for Central Asian producers .
the eu will lend political support and assistance to Central Asian countries in developing a new Caspian Sea - Black Sea - eu energy transport corridor .
the eu will promote the creation of an integrated Central Asian energy market and will support public @@@ -@@ @ private partnerships which encourage eu investment .
based on the objectives laid down in the Baku Initiative the eu will focus cooperation with Central Asia states in particular on the following matters :
• supporting and enhancing technological cooperation between the EU and the Central Asia states in the energy sector ;
• supporting sustainable energy development , including the development of energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and dem@@ and@@ sid@@ eman@@ agement ;
• supporting the " Global Energy Eff@@ iciency and Ren@@ ew@@ able Energy Fund " initiative ;
• encouraging the countries to take initiatives similar to those taken by the eu in the Action Plan for an energy Policy for euro@@ pe ( euro@@ pe@@ an Council of March 2007 ) .
in addition , the eu will continue to promote the extrac@@ tive Industries Transparency Initiative within the Central Asian region as a means to contributing to sustainable development and poverty reduction .
fair access to water resources will be a major challenge for the world in the 21st century .
most major environmental issues in Central Asia are related to the allocation , use and protection of the quality of water resources .
with the region connected through cross @@@ -@@ @ boundary rivers , lakes and seas , a regional approach to protecting these resources is essential .
linked to this is the need to improve forestry management .
there is a need to have an integrated water management policy ( upstream and downstream solidarity ) .
promoting cooperation on water management can at the same time foster regional security and stability and support economic development .
an eu@@ Central Asia dialogue on the environment was launched in Spring 2006 and will provide the basis for joint cooperation efforts .

the eu and Central Asia : strategy for a new Partnership
combating common threats and challenges
modern border management creating open and secure borders could facilitate trade and exchange in the region and help combat regional criminal activity , especially the international drug trade .
assistance in fighting organised crime will be one of the priorities of the eu in the region aiming at a reduction of non @@@ -@@ @ conventional threats to security .
migration is one of the major global challenges of the 21st century .
the impact of migration , both positive and negative , can be felt in all countries , including in Central Asia .

the eu expects that ongoing bilateral negotiations with Kazakhstan will conclude soon and will continue to support also other Central Asia countries in their efforts to join the WTO .
the eu has over the past year continued to encourage Central Asian partners to make better use of the eu gener@@ alised System of Preferences ( G@@ SP ) and to increase and diversify their economic production and exports .
the Central Asia Inv@@ est programme was launched by the EC in nov@@ ember 2007 with the aim to promote the development of SMEs in Central Asia , including by institution building actions for business intermediary organizations .

common threats and challenges
the eu and Central Asia states are attribu@@ ting increasing importance to " common threats and challenges " as a cornerstone of intensified relations .
increased drug trafficking and drug use in Central Asian countries as well as lack of efficient border management remain key challenges in the region .
the introduction of modern border management practices , creating open but at the same time secure borders would facilitate trade and economic exchanges in the region and help combat drug trafficking .
BO@@ M@@ CA ( Border Management in Central Asia ) and CA@@ D@@ AP ( Central Asia Drug Action Programme ) are two main eu programmes in that area and their implementation has continued successfully .
regional training facility for drug detecting dogs , in the town of Osh on the Tajik @@@ -@@ @ Uzbek border , built in 2006 with EU assistance

conclusion : the way forward
implementation of the Central Asia Strategy is well under way .
the past year has seen a significant intensi@@ fication of political dialogue and practical cooperation between the eu and Central Asia in all the priority areas indicated in the Strategy .
with high expectations in Central Asia and increasing relevance of Strategy priority areas such as energy diversification , the fight against drugs ,
joint Progress Report by the Council and the euro@@ pe@@ an Commission to the euro@@ pe@@ an Council on the implementation of the eu Central Asia Strategy
concerted action between international organisations is indispensable for efficient assistance to the Central Asian countries in their fight against contemporary security threats .
the implementation of the EU 's BO@@ M@@ CA programme by UNDP is one example of such action .
beyond official meetings , he extends his contacts with civil society and the media .
Asian countries while the Member States are expanding their network of embassies in Central Asia .
in April , Commissioner Ferr@@ ero @@@ -@@ @ Wal@@ d@@ ner opened the Euro@@ pa House in Ashgabat .
preparations have also been launched with uz@@ be@@ k@@ istan for the opening of a Delegation in Tashkent in 2008 .
preparations will then begin for the upgrading of the regi@@ on@@ alised Deleg@@ ations in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , and Dushanbe , Tajikistan .
the opening of a Delegation in Ashgabat will also be considered .
the eu is aiming to make further substantial progress in all priority areas of the Strategy .
a greater effort should be made to promote human rights and democr@@ atisation and to ensure active involvement of civil society , Parliam@@ ents , local authorities and other actors in the monitoring and implementation of the Strategy .
the eu will continue work on establishing or upgrading Human Rights dialogues with all Central Asian countries .
in the field of Rule of Law , solid cooperation should be established addressing key areas of legislation and the judicial system .
in the field of environment and water , the eu should be supporting a dynamic political process with the aim of putting an integrated regional resource management system in place .

on this occasion , discussion focusing on updating the drug action plan will begin .
we are thoroughly convinced that the development of cooperation among Central Asian countries , with the participation of international organisations and donor countries , will ensure the adoption of effective measures to fight this common scourge .
in this connection , we welcome the creation of the Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination Centre ( CAR@@ ICC ) for the fight against narcotics trafficking .
strengthening cooperation in energy , the use of natural resources and the environment
we will reinforce our cooperation in energy without prejudice to current cooperation .
we also note the necessity of enhancing our cooperation in renewable and alternative energies as well as in reliable , sustainable , low @@@ -@@ @ carbon technologies .
we are in favour of developing cooperation to jointly exploit hydro@@ energy resources , taking the interests of all the region 's countries into consideration .
the euro@@ pe@@ an union will provide support to the development of hydraulic energy in Central Asia that will also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without prejudice to the region 's environmental security .
we suggest that a dialogue be launched on how to address the threats posed by climate change in Central Asia in order to strengthen eu and Central Asian cooperation on this issue .
the euro@@ pe@@ an union will pay particular attention to regional cooperation in Central Asia on the rational , efficient and sustainable use of hydraulic , hydro@@ energy and fuel resources and the environment .

part one : the main features of T@@ emp@@ us
T@@ emp@@ us is one of a number of European Community programmes designed to help the process of social and economic reform in the Partner Countries :
the T@@ emp@@ us programme focuses on the development of the higher education systems in these countries through the most balanced cooperation possible with the partners from all the Member States of the European Community .
the first T@@ emp@@ us programme lasted from 1990 until 1994 .
the programme was consolidated and renewed for the 1994 @@@ -@@ @ 1998 and 1998 @@@ -@@ @ 2000 periods and , again , for the 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 period .
it has become customary to refer to these periods of the programme as " T@@ emp@@ us I , " " T@@ emp@@ us II , " " T@@ emp@@ us II bis " and " T@@ emp@@ us III . "
what does T@@ emp@@ us do ?
helping to establish new courses , or in reforming old ones .
T@@ emp@@ us can help in establishing a new university syl@@ lab@@ us in law , for example , or a medical institute to establish a new course .
it can facilitate the introduction of modern , stud@@ ent@@ focused teaching methodologies ;
T@@ emp@@ us can help universities to reform , say , a law faculty , or to introduce modern techniques for university management and academic planning ;
part I - Page 5
for example , T@@ emp@@ us can help institutions to set up networks on gas and oil engineering technology ;
providing material aid , but only , it should be stressed , in so far as it is needed to achieve the objectives of T@@ emp@@ us @@@ -@@ @ funded projects .
T@@ emp@@ us can help , for example , in recon@@ stituting libraries , with subscriptions to academic journals , purchase of computers and other teaching materials .
it should be noted that the T@@ emp@@ us programme does not support research .
the T@@ emp@@ us programme awards two sorts of grants :
to individuals - for example , professors , lec@@ turers , members of staff , ministry officials - in order to help them to travel to other countries for work related to a particular reform process .
within the T@@ emp@@ us programme this sort of assistance is known as an Individual Mob@@ ility Grant .
financial assistance is provided in accordance with the rules and regulations set out in a number of basic documents :
this Guide for Appl@@ ic@@ ants ;
the detailed Guidelines issued together with the contract ( available on : http : / / www.@@ et@@ f@@ .@@ eu@@ .@@ int / T@@ emp@@ us ) .
part I - Page 6
who is involved ?
two basic families of countries participate in the T@@ emp@@ us programme :
institutions from the following groups of countries may participate in T@@ emp@@ us projects , but on a co @@@ -@@ @ financing basis :
members of the Group of 24 other than the Member States of the European Community ; ( currently Australia , Canada , Iceland , Japan , Liechtenstein , Norway , New Zealand , Switzerland and the United States of America ) ;
• the Republic of Cyprus , Malta and Turkey .
who manages T@@ emp@@ us , and how is it financed ?
the T@@ emp@@ us programme is managed by the European Commission ( Directorate @@@ -@@ @ General for Education and Culture ) , which is based in Brussels , Belgium .
technical assistance is provided to the European Commission by the European Training Foundation , which is based in Turin , Italy .
the European Commission relies on a network of offices and officers in the Member States and Partner Countries as follows :
part I - Page 7
in the Western Balkan countries the European Commission and the local authorities have together established National T@@ emp@@ us Offices to perform a similar role ;
in the other Partner Countries T@@ emp@@ us Information Points have been created by the Commission to perform a similar role .
the European Commission is assisted in establishing overall political guidelines by the T@@ emp@@ us Committee , composed of representatives of the Member States .
within the European Commission , three separate entities are involved in the policy development and technical assistance underlying the T@@ emp@@ us programme :
the Directorate General for Education and Culture is in overall charge of the programme ; Gram@@ me ;
Europe@@ Aid Cooperation Office , a service of the European Commission established in 2000 , is responsible for the execution of most of the external aid instruments of the European Commission .
with regard to country specific priorities , authorities in the Partner Countries actively participate in the identification of those priorities which best meet national needs .
the T@@ emp@@ us programme involves a large number of actors .
however , in addition to the other members of a consortium , participating institutions would normally deal only with the European Commission and with the European Training Foundation .
how are projects selected and how are they monitored ?
deadlines for applications are set by this Guide - once a year for Joint European Projects , three times a year for Individual Mob@@ ility Gran@@ ts .
all admissible applications are then assessed by a panel of independent academic experts from the European Community and the Partner Countries and by the European Training Foundation .
part I - Page 8
the European Commission takes a final decision on selection , having consulted with the Partner Country ministries and taking into account the assessments of the academic panels and the European Training Foundation .
an indicative list of the Commission 's selection criteria and their relative weight can be found at [ http : / / www.@@ et@@ f@@ .@@ eu@@ .@@ int / T@@ emp@@ us ] .

the Commission 's project monitoring policy consists of different instruments : preventive project monitoring , desk monitoring , financial monitoring and visits in sit@@ u to projects ( field monitoring ) .
the objective of the project monitoring policy is tw@@ of@@ old :
to provide projects with guidance and advice for optim@@ ising the organisation of their activities and for achieving sustainable outcomes in line with the project objective ( s ) ;
on the basis of these reports the progress made towards the project objective ( s ) is analysed and evaluated ; ated ;
in addition to the financial assessment , the Commission organ@@ ises financial audit visits to project contractors to analyse and control the transparency of the financial project management ;
the T@@ emp@@ us programme is part of the European Community 's assistance to the transition process in the Partner Countries , which is provided through two programmes .
part I - Page 10
it is clearly important for all European Community assistance and cooperation activities to work in a complementary fashion .
the T@@ emp@@ us programme 's complement@@ arity with the broader transition context is assured through three mechanisms :
first , activities supported by the T@@ emp@@ us programme must be in line with the over all priorities and objectives established by the CAR@@ DS and T@@ ac@@ is regulations respectively ;
third , in the case of some Partner Countries , activities supported by the programme must be in line with the indicative priorities established by the European Commission in consultation with the authorities in those countries .
the European Community will support and assist them in introducing the reforms necessary to progress in these areas , notably through the CAR@@ DS programme .
stability Pact and Gra@@ z Process
the St@@ abil@@ isation and Association Process is the main contribution of the European Community to the Stability Pact for South @@@ -@@ @ East Europe .
the Stability Pact , launched at the initiative of the European Community in June 1999 , aims to bring peace , stability and economic development to the region ( http : / / www.@@ st@@ ab@@ ilit@@ y@@ pac@@ t@@ .org ) .
the Stability Pact embraces the countries of the area as well as many other European and non @@@ -@@ @ European countries and organisations .
part I - Page 11
the Gra@@ z Process has established several working groups , including one on higher education , which serve as platforms for discussion , policy coordination and development and advocacy for education cooperation with South @@@ -@@ @ East Europe .
partnership
the T@@ emp@@ us programme is more than a form of cooperation .
many of these links and habits will continue to exist and thrive once specific T@@ emp@@ us funding has ceased .
the programme is , therefore , of mutual benefit to all of the countries and institutions involved .
equal opportunities
potential applicants should note that the T@@ emp@@ us programme is strongly committed to the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities in order to ensure that no group of citizens is excluded from its activities .
project promo@@ ters are therefore asked to include in their project the respect and promotion of equal opportunities for all groups of citizens .

part II - Page 1
part two : cooperation activities under T@@ emp@@ us
the principal instruments for cooperation through the T@@ emp@@ us programme are :
joint European Projects
joint European projects are organised and run by con@@ sor@@ tia primarily composed of universities ( see glos@@ sary for definition ) .
curriculum Development projects focus on the content and method of teaching in higher education institutions in the Partner Countries .
they aim to create or update existing courses and to enhance the skills of teaching staff ;
University Management projects focus on the restructuring of the management , organisation and administration of universities ;
training Cour@@ ses for Institution Building focus on developing the administrative and institutional structures of the Partner Countries through the provision of courses aimed at improving the practical knowledge and up @@@ -@@ @ dating the skills of non@@ academic staff ;
multipl@@ ier Projects focus on a broader dissemination of T@@ emp@@ us project outputs through networks in order to widen the impact of the results and experiences of completed projects .
T@@ emp@@ us Joint European Projects can be submitted as either National or Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country projects .
national Joint European Project comprises institutions from only one Partner Country .
a Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country Joint European Project comprises institutions from at least two partner countries .
part II - Page 3
con@@ sor@@ tia are therefore urged to find ways of cooperating with Candidate Country Institutions and individuals where possi@@ ble@@ . sible .
curriculum Development Joint European Projects focus on the content , structure and teaching methodologies in Partner Country higher education institutions in certain defined subject areas ( see eligibility conditions ) .
curriculum and course development can be undertaken at graduate or post@@ graduate level , and may also include the introduction of short @@@ -@@ @ cycle , voc@@ ation@@ ally and professionally oriented higher education courses .
others ( eg@@ . university decision @@@ -@@ @ making bodies , non@@ academic bodies that could have an impact on the introduction of new curricula ) .
key tasks :
the development of new curricula and courses , or the adaptation or up @@@ -@@ @ dating of existing curricula and courses ;
the introduction of new degrees or the mod@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation of studies ;
the provision or the development of new teaching materials or the adaptation or up @@@ -@@ @ dating of existing teaching materials ;
the adoption of new or restructured teaching methodologies through the retraining and up @@@ -@@ @ dating of skills for teaching staff at home or abroad .
part II - Page 4
student mobility ( with guaranteed academic recognition of periods spent abroad ) should be an integral part of Cur@@ ricul@@ um Development projects and is actively encouraged .
although it is desirable that it should take place in both directions , this is not obligatory .
student mobility can make a clearly defined contribution to the achieve ment of the project objective , in particular by aiming at :
the success of a University Management project will depend on the support of the university leadership and decision @@@ -@@ @ making bodies as well as on the active involvement of the administrative staff in charge of the implementation of reforms .
the support of all relevant parties should , therefore , be demonstrated , and their respective roles in project implementation outlined in the application .
if a project targets cooperation with organisations from the university environment , these should , likewise , be included in the project consortium ( e.g. chambers of commerce , enterprises , local authorities , etc ) .
all staff involved in the management and administration of a university , including staff of the following bodies and services ;
University decision @@@ -@@ @ making bodies ( e.g. University Senate , Rec@@ tor 's Office , Dean 's Office , student representation ) ;
part II - Page 5
knowledge and technology transfer centres ;
key tasks :
University Management projects may address one or several of the following tasks :
strengthening of strategic management capacities : the development of strategic management plans , institutional profiles or mission plans .
reform of university governance and finance : the review and adaptation of decision @@@ -@@ @ making procedures and responsibilities of the various university bodies ;
training Cour@@ ses for Institution
composition of the project consortium :
in transition countries universities can make an important contribution to the reform or development of administrative and institutional structures , the strengthening of civil society , democracy and the rule of law .
part II - Page 6
training Cour@@ ses for Institution Building could , for example , lead to the establishment of a training centre linked to the Partner Country university .
the developed Training Cour@@ ses could also be integrated into the curricula for the university 's students .
social partners and their training organisations ;
media and media organisations , chambers of commerce , professional associations , enterprises , non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations .
key tasks :
the development and delivery of short Training Cour@@ ses for Institution Building of one to six months ' duration which target the non@@ academic sector ;
the adaptation and improvement of Training Cour@@ ses during the life of the project , taking into consideration regular feedback from train@@ ees ;
the establishment of a realistic timetable for the delivery of courses which is appropriate for the needs of train@@ ees in full@@ - and part @@@ -@@ @ time employment ;
the provision of appropriate language and inform@@ atics training ;
part II - Page 7
these networks must draw on the experience of previously implemented projects with a view to widening the impact of their results at national or Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country level .
in this framework , exchange and cooperation among higher education institutions may typically lead to :
a conver@@ gent framework for curricula or Training Cour@@ ses between a wide range of institutions ;
or to the comparative analysis of past or ongoing reforms which could feed into the institutional , national , and for Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country reform processes ;
or also to the establishment of formal cooperation agreements between universities and / or institutions .
higher education institutions ;
any other institutions that could benefit from or provide input to the dissemination of experiences and outcomes , including :
key tasks :
identification and evaluation of results of previously implemented projects relevant to the main objective of the Multi@@ pl@@ ier Project ;
improving the quality of selected outputs and adapting them to the needs of the identified target public .
part II - Page 8
the goals of a project should always be viewed in the context of the wider environment .
every attempt should be made to cooperate with relevant individuals outside the consortium in order to achieve sustainable results .
at least one university from each Partner Country involved in the project ;
at least one university in one European Community Member State , and one consortium member ( university , institution or industry / company ) in a different Member State ;
for Multi@@ pl@@ ier projects only : a minimum of five partners of which :
one of the consortium members must act as Contrac@@ tor .
the institution acting as Contrac@@ tor must be located in the European Community .
the Contrac@@ tor is legally responsible for the administration of the T@@ emp@@ us grant in accordance with the plans present ed in the application and the terms of the contract awarded .
one of the consortium members must act as Coordinator .
the Coordinator is responsible for the management , coordination and monitoring of the project activities and the coordination of consortium members , for the assessment of achieved outcomes and for the verification of reports on activities .
part II - Page 9
individual experts from non@@ consortium members may be invited to participate in project activities provided their involvement is justified and will assist all partners in reaching the project objective .
project Ex@@ pen@@ dit@@ ure
grants typically cover costs related to staff costs , equipment , printing and publishing , dissemination and mobility @@@ -@@ @ related costs .

part three : priorities for the Partner Countries
potential candidates should be aware that the European Commission , and in particular its Directorate General for External Relations ( " D@@ G RE@@ LE@@ X " ) , regularly updates its strategies with regard to Partner Countries .
potential candidates are therefore advised to consult the D@@ G RE@@ LE@@ X website at http : / / euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu@@ .@@ int / com@@ m / D@@ GS / external _ relations / index _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m to inform themselves about the latest developments and in particular to be aware of any newly @@@ -@@ @ adopted strategy papers .
in the CAR@@ DS context the T@@ emp@@ us programme 's activities should be seen against the backdrop of the European Community 's overall vision for the region of South @@@ -@@ @ eastern Europe and a number of ongoing processes .
at present , there are three over@@ arch@@ ing priorities , which are equally relevant for all CAR@@ DS countries .
participation in the Bologna Process
the Bologna Process aims at the establishment of a European Higher Education Area .
the year 2010 was defined as a target date for the achievement of the actions defined by the Bologna Declaration .
two years after signing the Bologna Declaration , European Ministers in charge of higher education representing 32 signatories met in Prague in order to review the progress achieved and to set directions and priorities for the coming years of the process .
further details on the latest developments can be obtained on the website of the European University Association ( EU@@ A ) : http : / / www.@@ un@@ ig@@ e.@@ ch / EU@@ A
promotion of a European dimension in quality assurance ;
elimination of remaining obstacles to the free mobility of students and teachers .
reforms of university governance , management and finance
the T@@ emp@@ us Programme therefore attaches importance to the reform of university governance , management and finance aimed at the development of integrated institutions of which faculties are constituent parts .
these institutions should have responsibility for the management of their total budget and provide the necessary human resources and central services that character@@ ise an integrated institution .
multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country Cooperation
the promotion of regional cooperation is not only a general priority for the St@@ abil@@ isation and Association Process and the Stability Pact , but also a specific priority for higher education .
priorities for CAR@@ DS Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country T@@ emp@@ us Projects
multi Partner @@@ -@@ @ Country projects involve institutions from more than one CAR@@ DS country .
projects also include , like any other T@@ emp@@ us project , a minimum of two partners from the European Community 's Member States .
ensure a fair and balanced participation of all partners in project activities ;
realise outcomes that are beneficial to all participating CAR@@ DS countries .

the 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 T@@ ac@@ is Regulation
the new T@@ ac@@ is Regulation was adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1999 and covers the period 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 .
it is the legal basis that regulates the provision of assistance to the Partner Countries .
the areas where T@@ ac@@ is funding is used are designed to complement each other and each T@@ ac@@ is Partner Country has carefully selected three of the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned fields .
the T@@ emp@@ us priorities should be consistent with these choices .
partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements
applicants should understand that , as well as the regulatory framework indicated above , projects take place within the context of bilateral agreements between the Commission and the Partner Countries .
partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements are legal frameworks , based on the respect of democratic
part III - Page 20
principles and human rights , setting out the political , economic and trade relation ship between the European Community and its Partner Countries .
relevant provisions within the Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements refer to education and training as key @@@ -@@ @ elements in the development of future relations between both parties , including a specific reference to the T@@ emp@@ us Programme .
priorities for T@@ ac@@ is Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country Projects
the T@@ emp@@ us Programme promotes Multi @@@ -@@ @ Partner Country cooperation in the T@@ ac@@ is countries in line with the objectives of the T@@ ac@@ is regional initiatives and the Partnership and Cooperation Agre@@ ements .
such projects involve institutions from more than one T@@ ac@@ is country .
projects also include , as in other T@@ emp@@ us project , a minimum of two partners from the European Community Member States .
priority is given to projects which :
provide a clear justification of the advantages of working at a multi @@@ -@@ @ partner country level rather than at national level ;
address reform needs which are relevant for all participating T@@ ac@@ is countries ;
ensure a fair and balanced participation of all partners in project activities ;
realise outcomes in all participating T@@ ac@@ is countries .
common Strate@@ gies ( Russian Federation and Ukraine )
the Common Strate@@ gies on the Russian Federation and Ukraine set out overall policy guidelines for activities with both countries .
both Common Strate@@ gies view the T@@ emp@@ us programme as an instrument to bring members of civil society closer together through the inclusion of professional associations and trade unions , universities , non @@@ -@@ @ gon@@ vern@@ mental organisations , the media and so on .

illicit drug use and trafficking are worldwide phenomena that threaten health and social stability .
statistics show that one European citizen dies every hour from a drug over@@ dose and close to 8 000 Europeans lose their lives to drugs every year .
meanwhile , ever @@@ -@@ @ changing patterns in supply and demand call for constant monitoring and dynamic responses .
independent , science @@@ -@@ @ based information is a vital resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them .
it was on this premise , and in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon , that the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Drug Ad@@ diction ( EM@@ CD@@ DA ) was established in 1993 .
inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995 , it is one of the EU 's decentr@@ alised agencies .
the EM@@ CD@@ DA exists to provide the EU and its Member States with a factual overview of European drug problems and a solid evidence base to support the drugs debate .
at the heart of the agency 's work is the promotion of scientific excellence .
to achieve its core task of providing sound and comparable information on drugs in Europe , the EM@@ CD@@ DA has developed the infrastructure and tools needed to collect country data in a harmon@@ ised way .
while the EM@@ CD@@ DA is primarily European in focus , it also works with partners in other world regions , exchanging information and expertise .
collaboration with European and international organisations in the drugs field is also central to its work as a means of enhancing understanding of the global drugs phenomenon .
the EM@@ CD@@ DA works on the principle that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs .
although it does not propose policy , the agency is now making a clear impact on decision @@@ -@@ @ making through its analyses , standards and tools .
EM@@ CD@@ DA , your reference point on drugs in Europe
the EM@@ CD@@ DA 's main output is its yearly overview of the European drug phenomenon which it presents in a multilingual annual report package .
this is essential reading for policymakers , scientists and practitioners in the drugs field or anyone seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .
these bodies are the main information interface between the EM@@ CD@@ DA and its Member States .
as such , they provide national drug information to the agency for EU @@@ -@@ @ level analysis and play the role of EM@@ CD@@ DA " ambassadors " at home .
understanding the nature and scale of the drugs problem is a critical requirement for effective policymaking and action .
the EM@@ CD@@ DA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools ( e.g. key indicators , core datas@@ ets ) which offer countries a " common language " with which to interpret the drug phenomenon .
as well as monitoring the drug situation today , the EM@@ CD@@ DA is ever vigilant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies .

by providing a European overview of such responses to drug problems , it helps countries follow trends and design appropriate strategies .
its Best practice portal helps those working in the areas of prevention , treatment , harm reduction and social reintegration take evidence @@@ -@@ @ based decisions when planning interventions .

conclusions
initially , there was no reference framework available - observatories were set up using trial and error , taking into account different national contexts and resources .
this explains why today there are as many models of observatories as there are countries establishing them .
looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to form@@ alise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region .
over time , the tool@@ box will develop with the help of readers and operational national drugs observatories : it will provide a platform for sharing practical materials and reference models .

chapter 1@@ Why do we need a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
what is a national drugs observ@@ atory ( N@@ DO ) ?
what is its role ?
these are only a few of the questions that this hand@@ book tries to address in a practical manner , starting with the most important one : why do we need a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
the adoption of the United Nations Conventions (
States to regularly report on the drugs situation as well as on interventions , covering both supply and demand .
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
this change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions , and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful .
two trends have developed in parallel in this area : political leaders need tools to evaluate if the measures and interventions implemented have had an impact , and if so , what impact .
similarly , the public is increasingly demanding this sort of information from its leaders .
in the field of drugs , over the last seven to eight years there has been an increased number of initiatives at national or regional level to evaluate or carry out an impact assessment of anti @@@ -@@ @ drugs strategies and other national action plans .
chapter 1 : why do we need a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
a key role for national observatories
what we can conclude from the various working groups , public and expert debates that took place in 2008 and 2009 and that are still ongoing , is very simple :
• supranational or international drug information networks can only work if they receive high quality , comparable information from their respective participating countries ;
• national drugs observatories can make a key contribution to international community efforts on data collection , analysis and interpretation ;
• a national drugs observ@@ atory is a key instrument for policymaking - it is not a political instrument .
this hand@@ book targets the needs of three groups , with a specific objective for each of them :
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
• What is a national drugs observ@@ atory ( Chapter 2 ) • Running a national drugs observ@@ atory :
• En@@ sur@@ ing success : strategic diagnosis ( Chapter 6 ) • Chall@@ eng@@ ing questions ( Chapter 7 ) • Con@@ clu@@ sions
chapter 2@@ What is a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
a national drugs observ@@ atory ( N@@ DO ) is an organisation that provides its country with factual , objective , reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences .
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policymaking and for the organisation of drug @@@ -@@ @ related services , and on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues of general interest ;
• to collect and to produce the information needed to fulfil its country 's reporting obligations to supranational and international monitoring and drug @@@ -@@ @ control programmes .
to reach its objectives , the N@@ DO must perform three core functions , either with its own resources or in conjunction with other national institutions and experts :
• data collection and monitoring at national level ; • analysis and interpretation of the information collected ; • reporting and dissemination of the results .
the main publication produced by the N@@ DO on a yearly basis is its national report or at least an update on the national situation .
in addition to this report , an N@@ DO may be expected to produce ad hoc studies and other reports .
while establishing or evaluating the position of a national drugs observ@@ atory , it is also necessary to assess its success and sustainability using three key strategic factors :
• perceived added value ; • availability and combination of resources ; and • cooperative production processes .
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
• a concerted and balanced national drugs coordination mechanism , which over@@ sees the various actors implementing a national drugs strategy ;
chapter 2 : what is a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
data collection and monitoring at national level
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
another ongoing aspect of developing the aforementioned network is a constant effort to improve the knowledge base .
this may be achieved either by improving existing processes and national reporting standards , and / or by establishing new sources of information .
the ability to raise awareness and funds for improving the national data collection network is extremely useful in this context .
the N@@ DO needs staff with excellent communication and negotiation skills and a proven capacity for consensus @@@ -@@ @ building .
the challenge for the N@@ DO lies in the constant and mutual inter@@ connection of suppl@@ y@@ - and dem@@ and@@ related information networks , in a way that offers added value for all partners and is log@@ istically feasible .
the N@@ DO progressively builds its expertise in providing rigorous scientific , un@@ biased and non @@@ -@@ @ speculative interpretation and analysis of the data collected , and in synthe@@ si@@ sing it into
chapter 2 : what is a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
the analysis and interpretation of the information collected should focus on :
it is of particular importance that the N@@ DO provides an update of the national drugs situation yearly , both for national and for international purposes .
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
however , although these issues are important , they C@@ AN@@ NOT alone predict success or failure .
a critical issue for the development and strengthening of the N@@ DO lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other publications in cooperation with its national and local partners .
chapter 3@@ Running a national drugs observ@@ atory - data collection and monitoring
objective and strategy
what are we looking for ?
how to proceed ?
this involves :
adopting international reference tools
what kind of data / information are needed ?
are there reference frameworks ?
monitoring and other drug @@@ -@@ @ related data collection activities started three decades ago in different regions of the world , under the auspices of various international and regional organisations .

building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
the Lisbon Consensus identifies 13 areas of strategic / policy interest which are monitored using a range of tools and formats , by all supranational and international organisations :
• Drug consumption by young people ( prevalence and incidence ) ;
• Drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime ( violations of drug laws ; proportion of property crimes associated with drug consumption ; proportion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption ) ;
based on this list , each regional or international drug monitoring network has developed its own model taking into account its specific needs and its institutional environment , but the core data remain the same .
further comments will be made in Chapter 5 , under the heading " Reporting to supranational and international organisations . "
chapter 3 : running a national drugs observ@@ atory - data collection and monitoring
monitoring the situation - Ep@@ id@@ emi@@ ology , crime and markets
work in this area is structured around three main components : key epidemiological indicators , crime and markets and the action on new drugs .
5 key epidemiological indicators :
see http : / / ec@@ .@@ euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu / justice _ home / f@@ s@@ j / drugs / strategy / f@@ s@@ j _ drugs _ strategy _ en@@ .@@ ht@@ m for detail@@ s.@@ This is a general overview of the EM@@ CD@@ DA 's activities .
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
prevalence and patterns of drug use among the general population are measured by prob@@ abil@@ istic surveys of the adult and school population .
this key indicator collects data on the prevalence and incidence of problem drug use ( PD@@ U ) at national and local level .
problem drug use is defined as " injecting drug use or long @@@ -@@ @ duration / regular use of opi@@ oids , cocaine and / or am@@ ph@@ et@@ am@@ ines . "
the data sources employed to calculate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the routine information systems used in the country .
the treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next .
the treatment demand indicator ( T@@ DI ) consists of recommendations regarding method , definitions and items to be collected in relation to problem drug users presenting to drug treatment facilities .
these data are collected and coll@@ ated nationally , and delivered annually .
other data are collected to complement the picture of the drugs situation from a law enforcement perspective , targeting drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime and availability .
availability of illicit drugs

• an " early @@@ -@@ @ warning system " to identify new drugs as they appear on the European market ;
• a mechanism for assessing the risks of these drugs ; and
• a decision @@@ -@@ @ making process ( control measures ) through which these products may be placed under control in the EU Member States .
chapter 3 : running a national drugs observ@@ atory - data collection and monitoring
• collect quantitative data on the number of people reached by drug treatment in Member States , and more specifically the number of clients receiving substitution / maintenance treatment .

at this stage we should make two observations :

once the proposal for a national drug information system is ready , it has to be approved by the national authorities .
in some cases , cooperation protocols may need to be concluded between different institutions and the N@@ DO .

• Th@@ ink about the concrete outputs and their relevance • Build a transparent system

• Comb@@ ining sources of information / data ; • Po@@ ol@@ ing compet@@ ences and analysis and reporting capacity ; • Sharing limited resources ;
motivation and participation C@@ AN@@ NOT be commanded ; they are obtained through strong communication and clear mutual benefit .

• Keep the network informed and make sure that the members of the network keep the N@@ DO informed

the N@@ DO 's networking strategy may also help motivate data providers to deliver quality data and further address the issue of quality as part of the data collection process .

this critical process should entail the following :
• working with quantitative data ; • analysing qualitative information ; • interpreting and putting together all sources of information .
in most cases , these data are routinely collected .
chapter 4 : running a national drugs observ@@ atory - analysis and interpretation
metadata give us insight as to how data were collected , what they describe and refer to , and about the reliability and compar@@ ability of the information provided .
if data are routinely collected , what is their origin , how is the data collection organised ?

analysing and interpreting quantitative data require a sound knowledge of statistical analysis and of the most commonly used statistical software .
qualitative data used by an N@@ DO usually originate from two different sources : contextual information from key in@@ forman@@ ts and formal qualitative research studies .
such wide @@@ -@@ @ ranging information requires more flexible tools and periodic@@ ity for collection than is the case for quantitative data .

ultimately , producing and disseminating outputs underpin the N@@ DO 's existence , as its outputs substanti@@ ate its visibility both nationally and internationally .
what should N@@ DO outputs contain ?
• make the added value of its outputs a priority ;
• go beyond the sole description of the past or present situation ;
• comply with international reporting procedures ;
how to report at national level ?
the challenge for the N@@ DO is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that customers are satisfied .
chapter 5 : running a national drugs observ@@ atory - reporting and dissemination

they need highly summar@@ ised , objective information on the national drugs situation in an international context and on drugs @@@ -@@ @ related issues of national interest .
clear , short and simple information , always in the national language ( s ) and sometimes provided at short notice .

following such analysis , the national drugs observ@@ atory can then assess :
• the appearance and nature of N@@ DO products and deliver@@ ables needed at national level , and
• how to use and format the results of data analysis and interpretation to match the needs of its different users .
the same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the format and content needs identified in the matrix .
know your national stakeholders and assess their needs :
summar@@ ised information on specific issues , topics of interest : e.g. policy brief@@ ings , executive summary of national reports .

information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues , structured and well documented contents , in a not @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ detailed format ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a compilation of documents ) .
very detailed information , including raw data , on specific topics , allowing them to make their own analysis and interpretation .
summar@@ ised information on topics of general interest , allowing the audience to gain some insight into changes in the drugs situation and above all about the responses that may be relevant to their needs .
why differentiate between analysis and reporting ?
are they not part of the same process ?
within the limits of its mandate , the N@@ DO needs to explore how it can make its work and products more useful and more relevant for its national audience .
there are two complementary ways to achieve this - by going beyond a simple descriptive reporting approach , and by tail@@ oring the products to audience needs .
producing a report that goes beyond a simple description of the situation can be done either by being proactive or by using the information available in a more creative manner :
how can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them ? "
a complementary approach can be to cor@@ relate the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level .
when the N@@ DO produces reports and other outputs , it should always be able to answer the ... " so what ? " question .
this leaves the reader asking " so what ? "
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @@@ -@@ @ defin@@ ed@@ . N@@ ed .
• Fur@@ ther explore how to make the information collected useful and visible
• Be prospective : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and perspectives , or new risks
• Be creative : what else can you do with the data gathered ?
Don '@@ t just be descriptive - present conclusions .
reporting to supranational and international organisations
reporting to these organisations is somewhat easier insofar as the expected format and contents are given .
there are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
this is what we will describe briefly , starting with the UN reporting system , which is used worldwide .
the UN reporting system is managed by the United Nations Office on Dru@@ gs and Crime ( UNO@@ DC ) .
" under the International Drug Control Tre@@ aties , Member States are formally required to provide annually information on the working of the international drug control treaties .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports Ques@@ tion@@ naires ( AR@@ Q ) and it had been regularly reported to the CN@@ D ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
revision of the mechanism for collecting and reporting information , " Meeting of the expert group on data collection , Vienna , 12 @@@ -@@ @ 15 January 2010 .
chapter 5 : running a national drugs observ@@ atory - reporting and dissemination
data collection in the C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS (
inter @@@ -@@ @ American Observatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID ) .
data collection takes place through two primary systems :
• The Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Uni@@ form Data System on Drug Consu@@ mption ( S@@ ID@@ UC ) comprises a series of stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed protocols for carrying out surveys on drug use , research on the consequences of drug use and studies on the relationship between drug use and crime .
each of the protocols are stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed with the goal of producing information that is comparable across countries .
• The C@@ IC@@ D@@ AT system to collect statistics on drug supply control ( uniform statistical system on control of the supply area ) .
this system involves an online response system where countries may enter statistical information on drug and chemical precur@@ sor seizures , arrests related to drug trafficking and other supply side indicators .
in addition , C@@ IC@@ AD carries out a tr@@ i @@@ -@@ @ annual evaluation process , known as the Multi@@ lateral Evaluation Mechanism ( ME@@ M ) .
the information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comprise the ME@@ M Instr@@ ument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
in addition to fulfilling the ME@@ M instrument each country prepares an introductory narrative document to contex@@ tu@@ alise the information provided in the instrument .
international monitoring systems - common challenges
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quantity and quality of the information provided by their respective Member States - this information needs to be accurate , provided on time , and reliable ;
• evaluation is generally separated from data collection , but data collection is essential to feed the evaluation process , which in turn feeds into decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
this is where national drugs observatories can make a strong contribution while remaining in their role by providing objective , factual , reliable and comparable information , based on international standards , and well established protocols .
at this stage , two tasks are of crucial importance :
chapter 5 : running a national drugs observ@@ atory - reporting and dissemination
when reporting to or for a supranational or international organisation :
• def@@ i ne beforehand a scienti@@ fi c and institutional validation process ( scienti@@ fi c committee , peer review , etc . )
• Make sure you provide the data and other national reporting packages on time
• Be factual and neutral , do not exceed your role : the N@@ DO 's credibility relies on its objectivity , not the political opinions of its staff
• En@@ sure that the information sent out has been appropriately validated .
after a needs analysis comes the time for choices , according to the N@@ DO 's mandate and its available resources .
this is why it is important to draw a stakeholder strategy taking into account N@@ DO resources , the availability of data and priorities .
how to organise communication with the media
in relation to communication and dissemination , particular attention should be paid to a special group of customers : media professionals .
the next step is to consider whether the N@@ DO 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
however , in the 21 century , communication C@@ AN@@ NOT be reduced to whether this happens with or without the media .
a more appropriate question would be " how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observ@@ atory 's communication strategy , within the limits of its rem@@ it ? "
in countries where the N@@ DO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
the main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming " hot " topics .
the N@@ DC usually trans@@ mits the report to its own communication department .
the information , press release ( s ) and various information packages are then placed on the Internet and the websites of the two institutions involved .
when relevant , the national drug coordinating body may decide to include the information in a national advertising campaign .

chapter 6@@ En@@ sur@@ ing a national drugs observ@@ atory is successful
in this chapter , we propose some tools for making a strategic diagnosis of the N@@ DO with reference to its institutional challenges , bearing in mind that each situation is unique .
our approach will focus on three key strategic factors ( K@@ S@@ Fs ) to be considered in order to ensure the N@@ DO 's sustainability .
institutional issues are only one of the challenges faced by an N@@ DO : the core operations are what give the substance and legitimacy of the work of national drugs observatories .
these were presented in detail in the previous chapter .
to make a strategic diagnosis , we must analyse the N@@ DO 's situation by describing the strengths and the weaknesses in terms of each K@@ SF , using specific criteria to cover a broad range of topics / issues .
the diagnosis should ideally be based on facts and figures .
key strategic factors ( K@@ S@@ Fs )
1 ) : environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
• to ensure its sustainability , the N@@ DO must answer the needs of various audiences at different levels , who either play or could play a role in providing extra resources ( perceived added value )
chapter 6 : ensuring a national drugs observ@@ atory is successful
bearing in mind the N@@ DO 's situation , we can say that :
• the value of its work is quite complex to assess , as it is a response to a political decision that affects the country as a whole , including reporting obligations ;
• the value of the N@@ DO 's work is not always measurable - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and outputs ;
• the value of the N@@ DO 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
• most importantly , even if the N@@ DO was established to meet some international obligations , if C@@ AN@@ NOT fulfil its role if it does not answer national needs .
example of how to ask the question : " what is an N@@ DO ?
what are you doing ? , " when asked by a decision @@@ -@@ @ maker :
• use vague administrative or scientific terms , such as
" we are collecting factual , objective , comparable and reliable information on the drugs situation ... "
" we have been established in the framework of the preparation for EU Acc@@ ession and as such we are part of .@@ ... "
" every year we send a report to Lisbon ( or Vienna , or Washington , or ... ) . "
note : an " elevator pitch " ( or elevator speech ) is an overview of an idea for a product , service , or project .
the name reflects the fact that an elevator pitch can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 50 @@@ -@@ @ 100 words ) .

is the N@@ DO trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
is there any policy within the N@@ DO to identify existing or potential needs for drug @@@ -@@ @ related information among its audiences and its stakeholders ?
media relations : how would you character@@ ise the N@@ DO 's relations with the media ?
does the N@@ DO have a public relations ( PR ) policy and a PR officer ?
can the N@@ DO communicate directly with media ?
do newspapers and journalists know the N@@ DO exists and do they refer to its reports and publications ?
do they spontaneously contact the N@@ DO when they need some information on the drugs issue in the country or abroad ?
it means that the N@@ DO usually depends on existing sources of information and expertise available in the country to produce its own deliver@@ ables .
in fact , in many cases , most of the N@@ DO 's products are the result of partnerships and cooperation , and external expertise may be needed also to validate its analyses and reports .
• establish a partnership with existing sources of information and national experts , both for data collection purposes and for developing reporting capacity ;
• realise that national monitoring capacity is the combination of different resources rather than their concentration ;
to support assessing the N@@ DO 's situation in terms of co @@@ -@@ @ production , we propose considering three categories of criteria for diagnosis : operating framework , reporting procedures and outputs .
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
criteria
operating framework
operating framework
established partnerships : describes the N@@ DO 's operating framework with the key sources of expertise and information in the country .
is there a formal partnership agreement between the main data providers and the N@@ DO ?
relations with data providers : does the N@@ DO have regular meetings with its data providers ?
are the data providers informed about the events / decisions / activities organised by the N@@ DO at national or at supranational level ?
are there provisions for sharing the results of the cooperation ?
national reports : does the N@@ DO draft its report ( s ) alone or in consultation / cooperation with national experts ?
chapter 6 : ensuring a national drugs observ@@ atory is successful
content : do contents of reports and other publications reflect the need for a multi@@ disciplinary and multi@@ faceted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
do the N@@ DO 's projects and outputs give a balanced view of the drugs phenomenon , addressing both demand and supply issues ?
quality assurance : is there shared responsibility for quality assurance and quality control ?
are there any quality control procedures before a report is published ?
does the N@@ DO promote the adoption of best practice for quality assurance through sharing and disseminating experience and knowledge with other countries and / or supranational organisations ?
mutual benefits : is the N@@ DO completely isolated ?
are there institutions challenging or even cont@@ esting its legitimacy ?
does the N@@ DO acknowledge the value and compet@@ ences of other institutions already working in the field ?
do partnerships offer mutual benefit to the institutions involved ?
is the N@@ DO playing a role in the exploitation and promotion of existing resources at local and at national level ?
is the N@@ DO managing to provide something useful to its partners in exchange for their data and / or expertise ?
K@@ SF 3 - Combined resources
human and financial resources are frequently presented as the starting point for any project .
here again , we suggest being less self @@@ -@@ @ focused .
the main priority for the promo@@ ter or N@@ DO head is undoubtedly funds and human resources .
this means he / she will tend to promote the " institution . "
however , those contacted for funds need to see why they should give money to an N@@ DO instead of something else .
this means promoting the " expected results and benefits " in any written or spoken proposal .
there is also a more empirical reason for this approach .
there are already at least some institutions and professionals on the field who have information , data and / or expertise on the drugs phenomenon .
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
the N@@ DO can only receive or benefit from other partners " resources if it turns itself into a resource for them .
to describe this K@@ SF , a broader range of topics than just the N@@ DO 's budget should be considered .
this is why we propose three categories : institutional support , operational capacity , scientific capacity .
figure 10 : K@@ SF 3 - Combined resources
criteria
operational capacity
N@@ DO mandate and status : do politicians and other deci@@ sion@@ makers fully support the project to set up an N@@ DO ?
does the N@@ DO have a clear organisational status , is it recognised as a specific entity , and does it have a clear mandate for sharing and requesting data and information from other institutions and organisations ?
is there any binding resolution from the national authorities on their own or in relation to any supranational organisation that supports setting up the N@@ DO and the national data collection network ?
does the work of the N@@ DO contribute to national reporting obligations ?
does the N@@ DO have a specific and explicit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy ?
staff and budget : is there a specific budget adopted on a yearly basis or an ad hoc non @@@ -@@ @ recurrent funding for specific activities ?
is the mission and work of the N@@ DO described in a yearly work programme with staff assigned exclusively to the N@@ DO on a full @@@ -@@ @ time basis ?
are the job profiles and salaries offered in line with the qualifications required and does the N@@ DO have the necessary equipment ( PCs , software , telec@@ oms , documentation ) to perform its tasks ?
does the N@@ DO have a strategy to li@@ aise with national authorities to maintain or increase the level of investment in the drug @@@ -@@ @ related data collection system ?
budget for routine and ad hoc data collection : are budgets available in other institutions and ministries for routine data collection ?
scientific capacity
data and information : are there any drug @@@ -@@ @ related data that are routinely collected at national or local level ?
are there plans for new routine data collection that would totally or partially meet international standards ?
what is the feasibility and likelihood to prepare and present new projects for routine data collection ?
what are the obstacles and what are the possible solutions ( financial , methodological , etc . ) ?
are the main groups of indicators and other sets of core data available in the country ?
is there anything that can be done at a reasonable cost to prepare their implementation ?
key strategic factors : an interactive and dynamic model
although the key strategic factors have been presented separately , it should be noted that they are part of an interactive and dynamic model and that they can be used for identifying the strategic opportunities for the setting up and strengthening of any N@@ DO .
this becomes a sound base for preparing a strategic plan for the development of the national drugs observ@@ atory .
• to ensure more perceived added value from its stakeholders at national and at local level ;
• to improve and to diversify the co @@@ -@@ @ production scheme so as to produce better products which are tailored to the needs of its different client groups ;
• to better combine the resources from national and local level , both in terms of data and of expertise , so as to consolidate the co @@@ -@@ @ production processes and the quality of publications and other outputs .
the analytical framework proposed is dynamic and flexible : there is no single model for ND@@ Os that should be applied in@@ distinctly to any country and to any situation .
what matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
indeed , the strategic diagnosis and the strategic plan are tools that support decision @@@ -@@ @ making at N@@ DO and stakeholder level : the better the information , the easier the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process .

where should a national drugs observ@@ atory be located ?
options for consideration
strengths and weaknesses
however , if too close politically , the N@@ DO 's scientific credibility and objectivity and even long @@@ -@@ @ term stability may be challenged .
it is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side .
however , sometimes the N@@ DO remains too far from decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , lacks visibility and institutional support of its role at national level .
the legal status can be extremely useful to form@@ alise the inter @@@ -@@ @ institutional and inter@@ agency cooperation as it " oblig@@ es " third parties to respect and recognise the N@@ DO 's role .
what should the scope of a national drugs observ@@ atory 's mandate be ?
options for consideration
• limiting the scope of the N@@ DO 's work to illicit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of supranational and international organisations such the EM@@ CD@@ DA and UNO@@ DC ;
strengths and weaknesses
if the N@@ DO 's scope is extended to lic@@ it substances , this gives an excellent opportunity to build a comprehensive image of complex social and individual behavi@@ ours linked to addiction .
it can also provide the opportunity to observe and analyse possible cor@@ relations between
if the objectives and expected results are realistically and clearly defined , whatever the scope of the N@@ DO 's mandate , all work must be productive and relevant .
in all situations , the resources that the N@@ DO is allocated to do its job must be consistent with the scope of its mandate .
how many people should work in the national drugs observ@@ atory and what background should they have ?
options for consideration
to address this issue , one should consider the following :
• The national drugs observ@@ atory 's technical competence should ideally mirror the wide range of subject areas covered by its scope and mandate ;
• The technical and scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how of the N@@ DO and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• Scientific background : the team in the N@@ DO should have the necessary skills to cover all aspects of the monitoring and reporting framework .
main profiles could therefore include : epidemi@@ ologist , soci@@ ologist , psychologist or other social scientist , tox@@ ic@@ ologist , stati@@ sti@@ cian , crimin@@ ologist and policy analyst ;
• Manag@@ erial and communication skills : general management , communication and networking , editing and dissemination as well as secret@@ arial support are all likely to be needed ;
• At least half of the staff should have a certain degree of professional experience and preferably clear scientific qualifications .
• Each country should find the structure and organisation that matches best with supranational and international reporting tasks and the national context ;
• Some countries with very limited resources have no choice but to start with one person .
in such conditions , an observ@@ atory can work if some or part of the core functions are taken on by key external partners ( e.g. a university ) , with the N@@ DO coordinating the processes that are extern@@ alised .
strengths and weaknesses
if the N@@ DO is a rather small unit , this should be compensated with formal agreements for the second@@ ment of the missing scientific resources .
1 number of staff falls under three full @@@ -@@ @ time posts or their equivalent (
how much does it cost to set up a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
options for consideration
in order to provide policymakers with a comprehensive picture of the budgetary and financial implications involved in setting up an N@@ DO , the national drugs observ@@ atory and national drugs information network must be considered together .
• The running costs of the N@@ DO in terms of staff and operations , including meetings with national and international partners ;
• Speci@@ fic costs associated to the mission and tasks of the N@@ DO , spread along the three key operating processes : data collection , analysis and interpretation , reports and publications ;
• In some cases it may be relevant to make a distinction between costs for national and international obligations ;
• It may be necessary to draft financial plans that set yearly running costs .
this means that the budget can be more limited for the first year of activity .
however , budgetary objectives for years two and three should be considered , at least as a reasonable perspective ( 2 ) ;
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ DO 's capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds .
this means that either in the N@@ DO or its host institution there must be someone with sound administrative and financial management skills ;
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
how can you guarantee the scientific independence of a national drugs observ@@ atory ?
options for consideration
when this issue is discussed , avoid confusion between " scientific quality , " and " institutional autonomy , " which are two different things .
• Scientific quality is extremely important to ensure that the data are correctly presented and interpreted , that they are true and trustworthy , and that they meet international standards .
the N@@ DO is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics .
if the N@@ DO is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
as already mentioned , the N@@ DO needs to pay special attention to avoid crossing institutional and competence boundaries .
should the national drugs observ@@ atory be involved in the evaluation of national drug policies ?
options for consideration
national drugs observatories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies , at the request of their respective national authorities .
however , to make this possible and relevant , a few principles need to be respected :
• there should be an official request addressed to the N@@ DO by its national authority , indicating the scope and the objectives of the evaluation ;
the same applies to the expertise needed to conduct the evaluation ;
• the N@@ DO should reserve the right to accept - or to propose a technical modification in order to accept - to perform the evaluation ;
• the N@@ DO 's contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds ( factual , neutral , objective , reliable ) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the rem@@ it of national authorities ;
building a national drugs observ@@ atory : a joint hand@@ book
strengths and weaknesses
when the scope of the work carried out by the N@@ DO within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the N@@ DO .
this is why all of the N@@ DO 's actions linked to any evaluation must be scientifically sound and well documented .
international assistance , provided either during the evaluation , for instance in a scientific steering committee or for a peer review may also help counter such potential negative reactions .
it usually also helps to better define objectives , and to better identify existing and new data needed for measuring the performance or the impact of some measures .
what comes next ?
how can we translate theory into practice ?
through the different chapters and sections of this hand@@ book , the reader has been given a comprehensive presentation of national drugs observatories , in particular :
• a clear definition of what is an observ@@ atory , its mission and objectives ;
• a detailed presentation of its three core functions which are : data collection and monitoring ; data analysis and interpretation ; reporting and dissemination ;
• an introduction to strategic diagnosis based on three key strategic factors ( K@@ S@@ Fs ) and their related criteria - perceived added value , co @@@ -@@ @ production and combined resources ;
• and finally , a suggestion of some options to be considered when setting up a national drugs observ@@ atory , with the main strengths and weaknesses of each option .
the time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice .
as you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
taking on board the ideas , concepts and experiences that have been shared with you in this hand@@ book , you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observ@@ atory should be like .
one last suggestion : use the processes and expected outputs as a starting point and build a system and a network around them .
there are no institutional models to be copied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

national drugs observatories have flourished and developed rapidly over the last two decades as a direct consequence of the decisions taken to establish regional drug monitoring systems , both in the European Union and in the Americas .
initially , there was no reference framework available - observatories were set @@@ -@@ @ up using trial and error , taking into account different national contexts and resources .
this explains why today there are as many models of observatories as there are countries establishing them .
looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to form@@ alise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region .
the hand@@ book is available in English , French and Spanish . other language versions are planned for 2011 .
the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Drug Ad@@ diction ( EM@@ CD@@ DA ) is the hub of drug @@@ -@@ @ related information in Europe .
its mission is to provide the EU and its Member States with " factual , objective , reliable and comparable information " on drugs , drug addiction and their consequences .
established in 1993 , it opened its doors in Lisbon in 1995 and is one of the EU 's decentr@@ alised agencies .
with a 100 @@@ -@@ @ strong multi@@ disciplinary team , the agency offers policymakers the evidence base they need for drawing up drug laws and strategies .
it also helps professionals and researchers pin@@ point best practice and new areas for analysis .

sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
executive summary
executive summary
populations , generally declining in the countries of Eastern Europe and SE@@ E and growing in Central Asia , range from 2 million ( Macedonia ) to 14@@ 3 million ( Russian Federation ) .
GDP per capita varies by a factor of 10 between Tajikistan and Croatia .
the report was prepared for the Six@@ th Ministerial Conference ' Environment for Europe ' held in Belgrade in October 2007 .
economic restructuring had a significant effect on all economies of the region during the first half of the 1990s .
this effect was exacerbated by conflicts in SE@@ E and the Caucasus and extended in some parts of EECCA by Russia 's currency crisis in 1997 / 1998 .
the main part of the report provides detailed information and a review of SC@@ P initiatives in key production @@@ -@@ @ consumption areas - industry , food , buildings , transport and waste .
industry has enjoyed growth in almost all countries since 1995 .
sustainable consumption and production is broadly defined as a holistic approach to minim@@ ising environmental impacts and maxim@@ ising social benefits related to production and consumption .
considered a practical implementation strategy to achieve sustainable development , this approach addresses economy , society and environment .
this has been characterised by the increasing export of raw materials from a number of resource @@@ -@@ @ rich EECCA countries and a greater import of manufactured goods from other parts of the world .
trends in household consumption
in all countries of the region , household consumption expenditure exceeds government expenditure by a significant margin but remains far lower than consumption expenditure in the EU .
while this has had a positive impact on the standard of living , it is also likely to have resulted in an overall rise in environmental impacts from household consumption .
the benefits of economic growth since the late 1990s have not been distributed evenly in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
the gap between the wealthiest and poorest groups of society has increased , and there are also significant differences in incomes between urban and rural areas .
despite policy declarations , framework strategies or policies specifically targeting SC@@ P have not yet been developed in EECCA and SE@@ E countries .
however , in most of the 18 countries covered in this report there are examples of SC@@ P @@@ -@@ @ relevant topics being tack@@ led , albeit in an isolated fashion and lacking any overall coordination .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
executive summary
industry is the first of the five thematic areas covered in detail in this report .
strong growth in industrial output was recorded in most of the region since the year 2000 .
consumption of high @@@ -@@ @ cost foods ( me@@ ats and dairy products ) was particularly affected .
economic recovery since the late 1990s has increased access to food for many households and consumption of almost all food groups has been growing steadily .
malnutrition rates have mostly declined , but in some countries remains an important social problem .
the absence of reliable data impe@@ des the development of realistic , targeted and effective policies on environmental management in industry , and h@@ inders the measurement of progress towards more sustainable industrial production .
food and environment are closely inter@@ linked : environmental deterioration limits food production capacity , while unsustainable food consumption and production patterns cause environmental damage .
agriculture accounts for most of the environmental impacts of the food production and consumption cycle .
food processing , packaging , transportation and storage and related energy use and wastes also play substantial roles .
overall progress in environmental management in industry in EECCA and SE@@ E countries has been limited .
among the various relevant services only the implementation of environmental management systems ( EMS ) is offered on a commercial basis .
other services supporting more sustainable production practices in industry continue to be provided primarily through donor @@@ -@@ @ supported programs .
the transition period saw a reduction or stagnation in agricultural and food production activities in much of the region , accompanied in EECCA by a strong decline in the use of fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and pesticides .
food production has partially recovered in EECCA but remains lower than pre @@@ -@@ @ transition levels in all but three countries .
these were mostly established through donor @@@ -@@ @ funded programmes .
despite low current inputs to agriculture , the ag@@ ro@@ environmental problems of sal@@ in@@ isation , soil erosion , and contamination of surface waters continue .
this is largely the result of poor management of irrigation , lack of collection and treatment of man@@ ure from livestock and other sub @@@ -@@ @ optimal management practices .
it is expected that livestock numbers and intensi@@ fication of agriculture will increase with further economic growth which could exacerbate the situation .

the adoption and implementation of similar strategies throughout the regions would bring about significant environmental , social and economic benefits .
a wide range of food and food safety policies has been introduced in EECCA and SE@@ E countries , but implementation has not always been consistent .
current appliance ownership is low in many parts of EECCA and SE@@ E , but is expected to increase as incomes rise .
in those SE@@ E and Caucasus countries with abundant hydro @@@ -@@ @ electricity , electricity use for heating and hot water is widespread .
yet strong challenges remain for the development of organic farming . organic certification schemes still need to be adopted in most of EECCA .
residential , public and commercial buildings
buildings account for a large part of the material and energy use of SE@@ E and EECCA economies .
energy consumption in buildings typically represents one @@@ -@@ @ third of national total energy consumption .
many countries have established energy efficiency strategies , but fewer have translated them into concrete action .
institutional capacity and the political will to ensure their implementation is uneven .
sustainable heating strategies , energy lab@@ elling , minimum standards for appliances , and economic instruments promoting energy efficiency are generally lacking .
in addition , recycling and reuse of construction and demol@@ ition waste could significantly reduce the demand for resources in the construction of buildings .
annual residential energy consumption per capita varies from 11 000 kWh in Russia to just 600 kWh in Armenia .
differences between greenhouse gas emissions per capita are even higher .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
following a deep decline in the 1990s , levels of freight and passenger transport have been growing since 2000 .
despite a few exceptions , the use of transport has not yet returned to the levels of the early 1990s .
economic recovery , with its increased levels of production and import and export of goods , is a key factor behind the growing transport activity .
total waste generation in EECCA and SE@@ E countries is high , mostly because of large @@@ -@@ @ scale resource extraction and processing .
total waste generation per capita in EECCA is 14 tonnes per year compared with 4 tonnes in the EU .
there are massive differences between individual countries in total waste generation .
amounts of industrial and municipal wastes are increasing as economies grow and the level of wealth rises .
the greater use of transport has been accompanied by an increase in energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases as well as other pollutants .
consideration might also be given to actively ph@@ asing out older , more poll@@ uting vehicles .
most land@@ fills are in a poor technical condition , and very few have collection of land@@ fill gases and le@@ ach@@ ate .
moreover , significant amounts of municipal wastes are disposed of in illegal or unprepared sites .
progress has been made in improving the quality of transport fuel , e.g. banning lead@@ ed petrol in most countries .
some industrial waste is recycled , in response to economic demand for their resources .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
some successful waste management programmes have been implemented at municipal level .
in many municipalities the waste management systems have yet to be modern@@ ised .
policy action should not only focus on technological aspects .
the ongoing economic and social restructuring in the region provides a unique opportunity to establish more resource @@@ -@@ @ efficient , safe and sustainable production patterns and , at the same time , improve the quality of life .
some elements of the ' legacy of the past ' can support a society with more sustainable production and consumption patterns .

sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
1 Back@@ ground , scope and methodology
at the Fifth Ministerial Conference ' Environment for Europe ' in Kiev in 2003 , the European Environment Ministers recognised :
unsustainable patterns of production and consumption are recognised as one of the major contributors to environmental problems , including climate change , degradation of natural resources and loss of biodiversity , and environmental impacts caused by emissions and waste .
the importance of a shift towards sustainable production and consumption patterns ' and committed themselves to ' encourage regions , sub ‑ regions and countries as appropriate , to devise programmes to accelerate this shift .
the challenge of achieving sustainable consumption and production ( SC@@ P ) patterns has been addressed at global level since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro .
since then , work has been carried out in the European Union to analyse consumption and production patterns and their effects on society and the environment .
the European Commission ( EC ) is to propose an SC@@ P Action Plan for the EU during 2007 .
several European Union countries have also developed Sustainable Consu@@ mption and Production strategies and action plans .
it provides detailed information and analysis of key thematic issues from an SC@@ P perspective and identifies opportunities to achieve greater sustainability within these sectors .
the process is intended to strengthen international cooperation , increase exchange of information and facilitate the implementation of national and regional SC@@ P programmes .

sustainable consumption and production - implementation strategy for sustainable development
sustainable consumption and production is a holistic perspective on how society and the economy can be better aligned with the goals of sustainability .
SC@@ P is a practical approach to achieving sustainable development which addresses the economy , society and environment .
SC@@ P aims to reduce emissions , increase efficiencies and prevent unnecessary w@@ ast@@ age of resources within society , through the stages of material extraction , investment , production , distribution , consumption , to waste management .
• reducing the material intensity and energy intensity of current economic activities and reducing generation of emissions and waste during extraction , production , consumption and disposal
cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting in character , SC@@ P needs the active involvement of all stakeholders and a wide range of locally @@@ -@@ @ adapted policy responses .

1.2 S@@ cope of the report
objectives and geographic coverage
in order to map out SC@@ P activities in the SE@@ E and EECCA regions , and to support the implementation of SC@@ P activities in countries , this report sets out to :
• identify key existing policies aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of these activities while maintaining their economic viability ;
in addition , opportunities for greater sustainability are examined , and positive initiatives presented .
barriers to the spreading of positive initiatives are investigated and options for breaking down these barriers are suggested .
finally , Chapter 9 concludes the report by identifying some possibilities for future work .
in chapter 2 and the five theme chapters , information and data are presented at sub @@@ -@@ @ regional and country levels , where relevant .
it is beyond the scope of the report to provide data on every indicator , individually , for every country within the two regions .
the report 's geographical coverage extends to the regions and countries in the Table 1.1 .
due to data collection practices prior to 2006 , data is available for Serbia and Montenegro jointly .

facts and figures
• The SE@@ E and EECCA regions cover 16 % of the global land area , contain 4.7 % of the world 's population , but generate only 2.4 % of the global GDP .
GDP in most countries in 2005 remained lower than in 1990 .
current growth in GDP is rapid , however .
• Share of the service sector has grown in all countries and now exceeds 50 % across Eastern Europe and SE@@ E .
the industrial sector has partially or fully recovered from the collapse of the early 1990s .
the recovery has been dominated by the relatively poll@@ uting and energy @@@ -@@ @ intensive extraction industries producing fuel and minerals for export .
• D@@ esp@@ ite improvements , energy intensi@@ ties of most EECCA countries are still significantly higher than in the Member States of the European Union , while energy intensi@@ ties of the economies of SE@@ E countries are generally similar to the EU .
• Pop@@ ulations have declined significantly in Eastern Europe and SE@@ E since 1995 but have grown in most of Central Asia .
every country is experiencing a declining percentage of children and an increasing proportion of persons over 65 .
• Not all segments of the population have benefited from economic growth .
the gap between the poorest and wealthiest groups of society is significantly higher than it was pre @@@ -@@ @ transition .
in much of EECCA , and to a lesser extent in SE@@ E , the proportion of the population living below the poverty line remains significant .
in all countries of the region , household expenditure by far exceeds government expenditure and is growing rapidly .
consumption expenditure of households now exceeds 1990 consumption expenditure levels in all sub @@@ -@@ @ regions except Central Asia .
household energy use , private transport and food are likely to be those consumption categories leading to greatest environmental pressures .
• The ecological footprint per capita exceeds sustainability limits for at least half the countries of the regions .
to set the scene , this chapter provides a brief economic and demographic background to the regions and outlines trends in production and consumption and related environmental pressures .

economic structural changes may partially reflect changes in national consumption patterns and a greater demand for services .
however , structural changes in national economies have also been significantly influenced by growth in international trade , particularly exports of fossil fuels and metals , and increasingly , the import of manufactured goods from other parts of the world ( C@@ IS@@ ST@@ AT , 2006 ) .

0 In Ukraine , economic growth was Cat@@ aly@@ sed by the export of steel and chemicals ( Kol@@ es@@ nic@@ henko , 2005 ) .
in Russia ( UNEP , 2006 ) , Kazakhstan ( Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Japan , 2005 ) , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan growth has been largely based on exports of energy @@@ -@@ @ carriers .
in 2005 fossil fuels and mining products represented 65 % of all exports from EECCA to the rest of the world , compared to 24 % for manufactured products and 7 % for agricultural products ( WTO , 2006 ) .
around two thirds of the total export of fossil fuel and mining products goes to the EU .
more information about exporting industries is given in Chapter 4 .

broad trends in production and consumption manufactured products , and processed foods ( C@@ IS@@ ST@@ AT , 2006 ) .
this rule are transport services ( see Chapter 7 ) , and some social and communal services , such as the provision of drinking water and sanitation which have high energy intensi@@ ties .
the second trend is the gradually improving efficiency of some established industries .
however , the shifting of industry from manufacturing and light industries to the exploitation and processing of fossil fuels and minerals may be pulling in the opposite direction .
due to exports , the industrial sector , especially in the EECCA region , is now dominated by one or a few industrial sub @@@ -@@ @ sectors .
typically , these dominating sub @@@ -@@ @ sectors are poll@@ uting and resource @@@ -@@ @ use intensive .
in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan , cotton industries account for large shares in industrial production ( see Chapter 4 for more details ) .
moving towards more sustainable consumption
energy use ( kt of oil equivalent )
in EECCA countries a number of counter@@ acting trends are affecting any potential decou@@ pling .
the first trend is the increasing dominance of the service sector in most economies ( see Figure 2.3 ) .

1 ) decou@@ pling , which can be relative or absolute , occurs when the growth rate of an environmental pressure is less than that of a

relative decou@@ pling occurs when an environmental pressure grows , but more slowly than the underlying economic driver .
by contrast , absolute decou@@ pling is achieved when an environmental pressure decreases while the economy grows .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
this is due in part to the structural differences between those economies ( i.e. a larger share of resource and energy @@@ -@@ @ intensive industries ) .
meanwhile , most economies of SE@@ E countries show much lower energy intensi@@ ties , comparable to those of EU Member States .
energy intensity of the economy is one key factor in overall greenhouse gas emissions per capita .

economic development can , and should , bring with it improvements in human well @@@ -@@ @ being and quality of life .
some countries appear to be less successful than others at transferring economic wealth into quality of life .
the Russian Federation , Kazakhstan , Ukraine and Azerbaijan fall into this group ( Figure 2.9 ) .
sources : UNDP , 2006 ; World Bank , 2006 .
the gap between the poorest and wealthiest groups of society has increased in much of EECCA and is significantly higher than it was pre @@@ -@@ @ transition .
for example , in Russia in 1991 the poorest 20 % received 12 % of total national income , while the richest 20 % received 31 % ( Sim@@ ai , 2006 ) .
by 2003 the income gap had widened significantly with the poorest 20 % receiving only 6 % and the richest 20 % receiving 47 % ( World Bank , 2006 ) .
differences in incomes between urban and rural areas also remain high in most countries of EECCA although there is no consistent trend .
in many EECCA countries , and to a lesser extent in parts of SE@@ E , the proportion of the population living below the poverty line is still significant ( UNECE , 2006 ) .
in Armenia , 43 % of the population was still living in poverty in 2004 , although this had decreased from 55 % in 1999 ( International Monetary Fund , 2005 ) .
even in Ukraine some 29 % of the population live below the poverty line with 3 % in extreme poverty ( UNICEF , 2006 ) .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
in all countries of the region , household expenditure exceeds government expenditure by far ( Figure 2.@@ 10 ) .
access to clean energy sources is also limited for many , especially in rural areas .
absolute levels of consumption expenditure since 1990 have followed similar trends to those of GDP .
household consumption expenditure in Eastern Europe is growing particularly rapidly and by 2005 was already 40 % higher than in 1990 .
meanwhile in the large cities , there is evidence of a growing urban n@@ ou@@ ve@@ au ric@@ he and middle class .

with respect to government consumption , the potential benefits of sustainable procurement policies remain significant in these countries ( see Chapter 3 ) .
populations have declined significantly in Eastern Europe and SE@@ E since 1995 ( Table 2.2 ) , with Ukraine having the third most rapidly falling population in the world ( UNICEF , 2006 ) .
Russia 's population decline is a result of increasing mortality rates and a declining birth rate ( Lis@@ so@@ vol@@ ik , 2005 ) , while the Moldovan decline is mostly a result of the mass emigration of workers .
the Ukrainian population decline results from both factors ; approximately three @@@ -@@ @ quarters due to increasing death rates and one @@@ -@@ @ quarter to emigration of people of working age ( Shan@@ gh@@ ina , 2004 ) .
by contrast , populations in Central Asia have increased by over 10 % in all countries except Kazakhstan .

every single country covered by this report is experiencing a declining percentage of children born and an increasing proportion of persons over 65 .
Eastern Europe , except for Moldova , is highly urban@@ ised , with levels of urban@@ isation comparable to those of Western Europe .
the level of urban@@ isation has a strong impact on the patterns and impacts of consumption .
dense urban areas can benefit from more efficient provision of services such as multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment housing , heating , collective transport , or waste collection and treatment .
on the other hand , in spra@@ w@@ ling urban areas the demand for transport can be high and the provision of collective services more difficult to organise .
in addition , consumption of processed food and goods , electronics etc. and generation of household waste is generally higher in urban than in rural areas .

in eastern European countries and Armenia and Kazakhstan the housing space per capita is increasing .
in absolute terms , total residential space in all EECCA countries increased by between 4 % and 23 % between 1995 and 2005 .
in Russia alone total residential space increased by some 3@@ 40 million m ² during the same period , equivalent to the entire residential space of Austria ( ENER@@ D@@ ATA , 2006 ) .
basic food and clothing still dominate household expenditures across the EECCA region although their consumption decreased from 65 % to 48 % of overall household consumption expenditure between 2000 and 2005 .
total household expenditure grew by more than 80 % over the same period .
this additional income was used increasingly on housing and utilities , transport and communication , home appliances and recreation - all categories with significant environmental implications .
spending on recreation increased by a factor of 5 between 2000 and 2005 , but still remains a relatively small consumption category .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
for some goods and services , environmental pressures dominate during the consumption phase of the life cycle and can be directly attributed to households .
for other goods , such as food , the majority of pressures can be associated with production ( or disposal ) .
0 A number of economy @@@ -@@ @ wide studies have identified the consumption categories with the highest pressures in the European Union ( EU Commission , 2006 ; EEA , 2005 ; Mol@@ l et al . , 2006 ) . these studies
consumption categories are presented in the order of the most rapidly growing - most rapidly growing at top .
sources : C@@ IS@@ ST@@ AT , 2006 ; World Bank , 2006 .
one of the main concerns about production or consumption activities is the environmental impact that they cause .
these cause changes in environmental conditions which in turn lead to impacts on human beings , ecosystems and infrastructures .
household consumption patterns vary widely across countries ( Figure 2.@@ 13 ) .
this is most pronounced in Tajikistan and Armenia where food represents 64 % and 57 % of average household expenditures , respectively .
in Tajikistan , despite increases in incomes since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , there remains little surplus for non @@@ -@@ @ ess@@ entials in the average household .
however , with current knowledge , pressures from production or consumption C@@ AN@@ NOT easily be converted into information on specific environmental impacts .
as a general rule of thumb , the higher the use of materials , energy and land , the higher the resulting impacts on the environment .
however , more research is needed to express environmental impacts and link them to specific environmental pressures .
throughout the remaining chapters of this report , environmental pressures are generally used as a proxy for environmental impacts .

within the housing category , energy use ( for heating and hot water ) dominates , followed by structural work ( i.e. construction and refurb@@ ishment ) and use of electrical appliances .
these can then be compared to the total global available bi@@ oc@@ ap@@ acity per person .

these consumption groups are covered in some of the theme chapters later in this report .

SC@@ P provides such an integrated approach to policy @@@ -@@ @ making , requiring close collaboration among different sectors and a wide participation of stakeholders .
the EECCA and SE@@ E regions as a whole face very different SC@@ P challenges than those faced by Western Europe .
a country 's ecological footprint is influenced by levels of wealth per capita , but is not firmly linked to it .
for example , Croatia despite a 40 % higher GDP per capita than Kazakhstan , has a significantly smaller footprint .
the differences between Croatia 's and Kazakhstan 's foot@@ prints and G@@ D@@ Ps would suggest that economic growth can be achieved while simultaneously reducing the ecological footprint .
in contrast , in much of SE@@ E and EECCA there is a clear need to address the social pillar of sustainability .
significant segments of the population live in poverty and many , particularly in rural areas , do not have reliable access to basic needs , such as clean water , energy for household and adequate nutrition levels .
the main challenge in a number of countries will be how to satisfy the basic needs of the population .

framework SC@@ P strategies or policies specifically targeting SC@@ P have not yet been developed in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
many countries have adopted ambitious environmental legislation and some seek to comply with EU directives .
however , it is often the case that environmental legislation is incomplete or inconsistent .
coordination between various environmental bodies , notably central and local authorities , also remains a challenge .
nevertheless , there has been very little progress so far in implementing G@@ PP , which remains a new concept for the authorities in most SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
this chapter reviews policies and policy instruments which can support implementation of sustainable consumption and production .
information about this is based on a G@@ PP survey carried out by the authors .
the chapter first provides a brief overview of the evolution of the environmental protection framework and then presents examples of policies and initiatives which can support implementation of sustainable consumption and production in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
the information is based on the survey carried out by UNEP , requesting governments of all 18 countries to provide the most recent information on implementation of SC@@ P .
a summary of the responses is presented in Annex 1 to this report .
a detailed discussion of environmental policies and instruments related to industry , food , buildings , transport and waste takes place in Chap@@ ters 4 to 8 .
while a comprehensive analysis of all available policy instruments to support SC@@ P was beyond
one of the main effects of the political and socioeconomic transformation in SE@@ E and EECCA countries was a fundamental change in the system for environmental protection .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
example , environmental authorities in Moldova and the Russian Federation have significantly reduced their staff since 2003 ( E@@ AP Task Force Secretariat , 2006 ) .
coordination between various environmental bodies , including central and local authorities , remains a major challenge , as demonstrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNECE , 2004 ) .
in the 1990s most EECCA countries drew up National Environmental Action Plans , often with the assistance of international experts and support from donors .
furthermore , only a small percentage of the activities listed in the NE@@ AP@@ s have been achieved ( UNECE , 2003 ) .

environmental impacts of products at the various stages of their life cycles .
responding to the questionnaire , Armenia reported adopting some measures relevant to integrated product policy .
similar initiatives have been implemented in some SE@@ E countries , especially those which aim to align their environmental legislation with the EU .
strategic framework to support SC@@ P
national strategies or programmes specifically focusing on SC@@ P have not yet been developed in any EECCA or SE@@ E country .
this limited progress indicates that in reality , despite political declarations , SC@@ P has yet to reach a high priority on the policy agenda .
various economic instruments are in use in EECCA and SE@@ E countries which provide financial incentives for SC@@ P .
the examples of instruments used , reported by countries , range widely .
Moldova , for example , charges fees on environmentally harmful products ( petrol , diesel , packaging materials , tires and batteries ) .
the principle of cleaner production in Croatia is addressed both in the National Environmental Action Plan and National Environmental Protection Strategy .
the latter sets the priorities for strengthening environmental protection and the implementation of cleaner production projects .

in 2005 Ukraine adopted a new budget programme on financial support for environmental activities , operating within the framework of the state fund of environmental protection .
an Environmental Protection and Energy Eff@@ iciency Fund was established in Croatia to support waste management activities , including those related to land@@ fills .
in 2005 several projects were financed through this system , including the renovation of the sewage system , improvement of solid waste collection , and development of the health system in three communities .
another objective was to encourage setting up facilities for waste recycling and processing .
other reported examples of economic incentives include preferential loan systems , and the use of pollution fees to support environmental protection projects ( Box 3.2 ) .

• In Kyrgyzstan , certain industrial facilities ( large mining facilities , thermal power stations , the water authority ) are required to report on their environmental activities in a format approved by the National Statistical Committee .
however , at the present time no SE@@ E and EECCA country has adopted policies introducing L@@ CA and L@@ CC .
• In Moldova the government collects statistical data on emissions and releases of pollutants into air and water , including hazardous pollutants .

L@@ CA analysis is often long and complicated .
in public procurement the price offered is always one of the most influential factors .
however , the purchase price represents just one of the cost elements in the whole life @@@ -@@ @ cycle .
other costs occur in the use and disposal phase .
more energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient products tend to be more expensive to buy , but less expensive to use , and L@@ CC is sometimes used in a procurement procedure to factor this in .
according to the life @@@ -@@ @ cycle costing approach , all the costs that will occur during the lifetime of the product or service should be taken into account .
for example , life @@@ -@@ @ cycle costing should cover :
• the purchase cost , including associated costs such as delivery , installation , commissioning , staff training , etc . ; operating costs , including energy , sp@@ ares , maintenance ;
'@@ spending to save ' , for example , a higher initial expenditure for additional insulation that leads to energy cost savings over time ;
• cost savings , for example , the creation of self @@@ -@@ @ run recycling markets ( e.g. printer cartridges ) and the sale of used goods to recycling companies ;
• end of life costs , such as decom@@ mission@@ ing , removal and disposal .
L@@ CC dis@@ closes the costs of resource use , e.g. energy and water use , as well as disposal costs .
L@@ CC is therefore an effective tool to back up not only more fis@@ cally responsible procurement decisions , but reduced environmental impacts as well .
when governments choose to buy goods and services that are environmentally preferable , they support sustainable production and consumption . application of G@@ PP can benefit the environment by :

in Croatia , the estimated overall volume of procurement of governmental institutions on the national level in 2005 was EUR 4.5 billion , equivalent to about 14 % of GDP .
about 80 % of this amount was awarded by public tender .
in Armenia , the 2005 public procurement from the state budget was about 18@@ 4 billion dr@@ ams - approximately USD 0.4 billion - equivalent to about 8 % of GDP .

experience in buying eco @@@ -@@ @ technologies also appears to be very limited .
the information presented in this section is based on a G@@ PP questionnaire survey carried out by UNEP and the author of the chapter between November 2006 and February 2007 .
in addition , all national public procurement offices / agencies established in SE@@ E and EECCA were contacted to complete or distribute the questionnaire .
consultants were also contracted to conduct on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ ground research in three cities ( Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan , Tim@@ iso@@ ara in Romania , and Yerevan in Armenia ) through direct interviews with relevant PP offices .
however , the response rate to the survey was poor , and only about 20 completed surveys were received .
detailed information from the responses received is available online ( 4 ) .
the following discussion will identify some of its key results .
the results presented above can serve as only an incomplete indication of current experience with G@@ PP in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
environmental criteria have not been widely used in public procurement in the categories of food / beverages , textiles / clothing , wood / furniture and paper / print .
none of the respondents has proc@@ ured biological or organic food , although most respondents said that biological / organic food is available in their cities .
this study not only asked PP officers about their use of environmental criteria in procurement , but also included tender analysis by independent specialists .

several factors could facilitate future progress with Green Public Pro@@ cu@@ rement in SE@@ E and EECCA countries :
a growing amount of information and literature on G@@ PP is already available on the internet , and could be used to advance G@@ PP and SP@@ P .
one of these benefits , the positive effect on the eco @@@ -@@ @ industry sector , should be emphasi@@ sed .
a nationwide comprehensive effort would be necessary to realise the great potential for G@@ PP in EECCA and SE@@ E countries .
support and action would be required from national public procurement offices ( regulatory , supervisory and supporting bodies ) , and closer cooperation between environmental authorities and national public procurement offices will be essential .
procurement offices had limited knowledge about availability of green@@ er goods and services .
except for Croatia , Serbia , and Uzbekistan , none of the countries in the EECCA and SE@@ E regions has introduced ec@@ ol@@ ab@@ els .

facts and figures
the industry sector contributes between 20 % and 45 % of GDP in the SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
even though industry 's share in GDP has generally been declining , in absolute figures industrial output has been increasing in recent years .
these dominating sub @@@ -@@ @ sectors ( such as extrac@@ tive industries , metallurgy or food processing ) tend to be pollution and resource @@@ -@@ @ intensive .
data on industrial pollution and resource use are scarce in all SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
available information suggests that some degree of decou@@ pling has taken place between industrial growth and emissions .
progress in implementing environmental management in enterprises in EECCA and SE@@ E countries has been limited .
with very few exceptions , compliance with environmental regulations does not currently represent a strong driving force for companies to improve significantly their environmental management .
among the various services supporting environmental management in enterprises , only environmental management system ( EMS ) services seem to be provided on a commercial basis .
all other relevant services continue to be supported mainly through donor @@@ -@@ @ funded programmes .

the information in this chapter is based on the existing literature on the subject , as well as on individual inquiries and interviews with experts from the SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
4.2 Tren@@ ds and current situation
4.@@ 2.1 Rec@@ ent developments in the industry sector
this chapter first provides an overview of the structural changes in the industrial sector in the SE@@ E and EECCA regions .
the analysis then turns to the implementation of environmental management in enterprises , reviewing existing policies and analysing those factors which determine success in implementation .
in addition to information on the EECCA and SE@@ E countries , Bulgaria , Czech Republic and Romania are used throughout the text for comparison purposes .
the industry sector accounts for 20 % to 45 % of GDP in individual SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
since 2000 , annual growth in industrial output has been steady ( Table 4.1 ) .

as already noted in Section 2.3 , in several countries , especially in the EECCA region , the industry sector is now dominated by one or a few industrial sub @@@ -@@ @ sectors .
typically , these dominating sub @@@ -@@ @ sectors are pollution and resource @@@ -@@ @ use intensive .
in Moldova the food processing and drinks industry is the dominating sector .
in SE@@ E , in addition to metals and petroleum , food and agriculture as well and textiles and clothing are important sectors .

the mining sector in Kyrgyzstan , a country where mining products are the largest export commodity .
as shown in Figure 4.1 , almost all countries experienced a strong growth in exports over the period 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2005 .
nevertheless , environmental requirements for imported products can be expected to be an issue mainly for trade with EU Member States and the US .
table 4.2 shows the five largest export commodities of SE@@ E and EECCA countries , in terms of their share in total exports .
products from extrac@@ tive industries still remain important export commodities in the region .
food processing and textile industries also account for a significant share of the exports in several countries .
typically , these industries put heavy pressure on the environment and are characterised by substantial consumption of natural resources .
over the last decade , industry in EECCA and SE@@ E countries has undergone profound changes in the ownership structure .
in many countries this process is likely to continue for several years , as ( or if ) these countries further progress in the transition to a market economy .

mining sector in Kyrgyzstan : selected factors affecting the sector before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union
situation during the Soviet era
centr@@ alised supply solved the problem of purchasing materials and equipment There was no need to find markets ( state @@@ -@@ @ run distribution system )
many towns and villages emerged and developed due to the operation of mining plants .
companies were responsible for the maintenance of the whole social infrastructure of the industrial communities , which negatively affected the basic cost of products
raw materials and commodities had fixed purchase prices
prices for energy resources and electricity were the lowest in the world .
non @@@ -@@ @ profitable companies ( e.g. Kha@@ id@@ ark@@ an Mercury Plant , Kyrgyz Mining and Metall@@ urgical Plant ) received state subsidies
special funds estimated at USD 40 @@@ -@@ @ 55 million were allocated from the state budget to maintain the mineral raw material base
a continuous staff retraining programme was available .
the access to raw material of antim@@ ony and uranium was lost ( previously delivered from Russia and Kazakhstan )
most raw materials , equipment and other materials necessary for functioning of the plants need to be imported . the company staff has little or no experience with purchasing abroad
insolvency of some domestic clients and fuel suppliers has caused additional problems
companies which were subsi@@ dis@@ ed in the Soviet era went immediately bankrupt after political independence
despite higher salaries in the mining industry compared to other Kyrgyz industries , several thousands of highly skilled technicians and engineers emigrated
companies virtually had no trained employees for new economic , financial and management tasks . also , no staff were familiar with of the requirements of world markets
increased substantially in several countries in recent years , even if at present it remains significantly below the levels in new EU Member States .
the strong growth in industrial SMEs can also be expected in the SE@@ E and EECCA countries .

this is especially the case for small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) .
both inflation and interest rates for short @@@ -@@ @ term commercial lending have declined gradually since 2000 .
in 2005 inflation was around or below 10 % in most countries of the region .
in general , when companies use commercial lending at all , they make investments which bring immediate benefits in terms of production and profit .
therefore , at the present time the implementation of environment @@@ -@@ @ related industrial investments in most SE@@ E and EECCA countries largely depends on the availability of preferential

however , reas@@ earch conducted for this chapter has not uncovered comprehensive and internationally comparable data on industrial pollution and resource use in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
available data cover only air emissions , including greenhouse gases , as shown in Figure 4.2 .
notable exceptions are transport and municipal services .
unfortunately , available information does not allow us to make any firm conclusions regarding this subject .
since some lessons could be transfer@@ r@@ able across many SE@@ E and EECCA countries , it might be worthwhile conducting specific studies and assessments to analyse industrial decou@@ pling trends in EECCA and SE@@ E .
detailed data and information on emissions , waste generation and resource use by industrial sources are a necessary precondition for designing and implementing effective industry @@@ -@@ @ related environmental policies .
however , as noted above , such data and information are not readily available in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
this is in spite of the fact that many countries in the region apply charges and fines systems on air and water emissions , as well as on waste generation and disposal .
these charges and fines are based on measured ( although in practice mostly estimated ) emissions , waste production and amounts of resources used .
box 4.3 includes a summary of EBRD 's latest assessment of progress in energy efficiency - and of prospects for renewable energy markets - in EECCA and SE@@ E .

current energy efficiency and renewable energy market t@@ r ends as assessed by EBRD
situation in SE@@ E and EECCA countries ( except Russia )
progress in improving energy efficiency has been slow .
low tariffs , the slow pace of industrial restructuring and more limited access to debt finance undermine the incentives for energy efficiency and push it down the priority list of investment options .
policy support is generally positive but this is rarely backed up with resources and targeted financial support .
most activity to date has been in smaller companies which have set their sights on international competitiveness .
many initiatives have been implemented in the food sector and in energy intensive processes such as glass manufacture - largely driven by booming demand for food and drink products .
renewable energy :
regulatory reforms to support renewables are largely absent or inadequate in SE@@ E and EECCA countries - many of which are still gr@@ appl@@ ing with basic sector reforms .
together with low energy prices the commercial environment for developers remains un@@ favourable .
as in more advanced transition countries , the biomass sector has received little structured support .
situation in the Russian Federation
energy efficiency :
as a country endowed with vast natural resources which have traditionally been made available to all consumers at very low prices , Russia has historically had little awareness of or inclination towards energy efficiency .
with recent increases in domestic gas and electricity prices , this situation is slowly beginning to change .
government policy supports energy efficiency but provides very limited resources of either a financial or institutional nature .
with the energy sector still largely dominated by RAO , UES and Gazprom and price liber@@ alisation still some way off , the prospects for a significant shift in attitude from consumption to conservation still seem remote .
one significant opportunity that is achievable in the short term is the availability of finance from carbon credits .
Russia is expected to become one of the biggest suppliers of carbon credits in the emerging carbon markets .
however , the legal and financial framework to take advantage of these opportunities is not yet in place .
renewable energy :
Russia has vast technical potential for renewable energy , particularly hydro , biomass and wind .
however , there is little support for renewables at present and with still low basic energy prices , few technologies can compete commercially in the current environment .
activity to date has been limited to occasional projects or small @@@ -@@ @ scale early stage technology development such as ti@@ dal power .
significant activity in the renewable sector will be unlikely without targeted policy and regulatory support .
4.3 Policies and implementation improvements in energy efficiency offer a big potential in addressing the question of energy supply .
according to the Russian Ministry of Industry and Energy , Russia could save up to 40 % of its current annual energy consumption through improved efficiency .
Ukraine , if it implemented all currently viable energy efficiency improvements , could reduce by half the 70 % of the gas supply it

availability of and access to affordable external finance ( both , commercial finance and / or subsi@@ dis@@ ed finance ) .
typically , better production technology brings about significant environmental gains , even if the motivation for buying new technology is not related to environmental concerns .
availability of experienced experts and consultants , who are able and qualified to provide required services to a company at an acceptable price .
one of the most important driving forces is - or should be - compliance with environmental regulations on pollution .
essential preconditions for achieving such compliance are the existence of realistic environmental policies and targets , and adequate enforcement of enacted legislation .
economic incentives to reduce pollution and waste treatment costs are another crucial motiv@@ ating factor for companies .
in addition to the driving forces in Box 4.4 , various supply @@@ -@@ @ related factors influence the feasibility of improving environmental management in enterprises .
economic incentives provided by the existing legal and policy environment , including : prices for raw materials and infrastructure , fees and fines on emissions , tax allowances , subsidies , etc .

need to switch to cleaner input materials and technology in production to remain competitive .
opportunity to replace obsolete technology when repair costs are close to the costs for new technology , or when a company is re@@ locating .

4.@@ 3.1 Overview of regulatory framework for environmental management in industry their environmental management .
in the long term , however , more effective way to address industrial pollution and inefficient use of resources will be through creating economic incentives to improve performance .
achieving this will , among other things , require the existence of functioning national markets that provide the necessary services on a commercial basis .
since the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia , many efforts have been made in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries to revise and improve the environmental legal and policy framework .
in 2003 the European Commission published a study assessing barriers and opportunities for convergence of EECCA environmental legislation with EU environmental law ( EC 2003 ) .

in addition , sometimes they lack the skills and capacity to function effectively : staff receive no or inadequate training , and often have a poor knowledge of the regulated community .
enforcement mechanisms are further weakened by enforcement agencies ' lack of recourse to economic incentives to reward compliance , or to legal and financial sanctions to pen@@ alise non @@@ -@@ @ compliance .
the levels of fees and fines are usually too low to act as a deterrent .
collection of imposed environmental charges and fines is a problem - collection rates range from negligible to around 80 % .

the expectation that environmental regulations will be more rigor@@ ously enforced may also have been a motivation there .
by far the most common services delivered by existing C@@ PCs are those related to cleaner production , energy efficiency , EMS , and training and capacity building .
involvement of C@@ PCs in financial engineering projects is much more limited , and only two C@@ PCs have carried out CSR services .

one of the major players in the lucrative Turkmen oil industry is the Turkmen@@ bas@@ hi complex of refineries , located in Say@@ mon@@ ov Bay in the west of Turkmenistan .
after more than 60 years of exploitation the environmental situation causes concern .
before construction of the Turkmen@@ bas@@ hi Oil Re@@ fin@@ ery in 1943 the Say@@ mon@@ ov Bay presented a rich reserve for flora and fauna , including rare species of birds and f@@ ishes .
oil products from production used to in@@ filtr@@ ate into ground waters , contributing to the pollution of the Caspian Sea .
at the same time a lowering of the sea level occurred .
the construction of the dam transformed the Say@@ mon@@ ov bay into a se@@ dim@@ entation water@@ bed and increased its pollution levels .
moreover , water supply , se@@ wer@@ age ( including sewage leak@@ ages into the bay ) and transport infrastructure of Turkmen@@ bas@@ hi town have had strong environmental impacts .
dis@@ charges coming from des@@ al@@ ination equipment operated by some tourist facilities heavily contributed to increasing water sal@@ inity .
in the early 1970s , the ecological situation of the bay was critical .
secondly , due to environmental concerns , the Krasno@@ vo@@ dsk State Reserve was created already in 1968 .
the site was then recognised by the Ram@@ sar Convention as a wet@@ land of international importance .
environmental monitoring and management were strengthened .
according to estimates , between 1995 and 2006 , more than 3 million tonnes of oil wastes have been processed and more than 600 000 tonnes of cleaned , re@@ conditioned oil could be returned to the production cycle .
thirdly , the rise in the sea level decreased pollution concentrations .
the dis@@ charges of municipal sewage gradually diminished the sal@@ inity of the bay and contributed to a partial biological recovery .
for investments in production technology and processes , as those types of investment promise more immediate economic and financial results .

one crucial aspect of such reform is improved enforcement . environmental enforcement agencies should , among others , start to work with tools such as compliance promotion .

there is a sizeable potential for environmentally sound technologies and in particular for the use of renewable energy .

5 Food
facts and figures
food , along with housing and transportation , is one of those household consumption categories which cause the highest environmental impacts over the life @@@ -@@ @ cycle from the household sector .
access to food is a fundamental quality @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life issue , and yet availability and access to food varies a great deal within each country and across countries .
although the rate of under@@ nour@@ ishment has declined in most countries , some still face serious problems of under @@@ -@@ @ nutrition for their citizens .
production of food is intr@@ ins@@ ically associated with the use of water and land , and agriculture accounts for most of the environmental impact of the food production and consumption chain .
other significant impacts originate from processing , packaging and storage of food , and its transport and waste disposal .
food production in SE@@ E and EECCA countries has been affected by a relative stagnation of the agricultural sector during the 1990s and early 2000s .
total production volume declined in half of the countries .
fish production declined by more than a third between 1992 and 2005 , as a result of over@@ fishing and collapsing stocks .
some species are on the verge of extinction .
the sharp reduction in agriculture and food production in most EECCA countries was accompanied by a strong drop in the use of fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and pesticides until the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s .
the use of pesticides and fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers began to increase again after the year 2000 .
many farms , although not officially classified as organic , are clean of chemicals and could potentially produce certified organic products .
the availability of agricultural labour also constitutes a great competitive advantage .
5.1 Introduction encompassing both crop production and animal hus@@ band@@ ry - accounts for most of the environmental impact of the food production and consumption cycle .
for example , agriculture consumes on average 70 % of the total water used globally .
however , there are other significant effects of the food production and consumption chain , including impacts from transportation , processing , packaging and ret@@ ailing of food , and food wastes generated at the point of consumption .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
conversely , a significant proportion of the population in many SE@@ E and EECCA countries lives below the poverty line and often suffers from food deprivation .
information on consumption trends and consumption behaviour in the SE@@ E and EECCA countries was limited by the lack of appropriate statistics at the country level .
therefore , most of the analysis on food consumption behaviour is based upon the results of three city studies carried out for this report in R@@ amen@@ skoye ( Russia ) , Belgrade ( Serbia ) and Ko@@ si@@ v ( Ukraine ) .
these case studies were conducted by local experts using focus groups and questionnaire surveys .
5.2 Tren@@ ds , driving forces and impacts
5.@@ 2.1 Historical background of food consumption and production
analysis in this chapter is based on data and information available from international
the structure of consumption and production of food in SE@@ E and EECCA countries was dramatically affected by the Soviet and Yugoslav leg@@ acies as well as by transition experiences during the 1990s .

sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
in some EECCA countries agricultural production was structured around large @@@ -@@ @ scale collective farms , producing in many cases mon@@ oc@@ ulture crops .
the agriculture industry had centrally @@@ -@@ @ established norms for food production that were imposed on state farms .
farm machinery , fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and pesticides were distributed to farms to meet these norms .
where food was bought , purchases were mainly made in state @@@ -@@ @ run shops and farmers ' markets .
in some instances privatisation was accompanied by partition into smaller farms .
a few countries ( e.g. Armenia ) , responded by trying to convert from specialised to more diversified agriculture to reduce dependence on imports from the other newly independent states .
centrally planned agricultural production often took little account of resource efficiencies or the su@@ itability of production of a particular crop to the local environmental conditions .
arable land was expanded at the expense of forests , and the drive to increase production relied heavily on extensive irrigation and drainage schemes and the intensive use of fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and pesticides ( EEA , 2007 ) .
not surprisingly , the environmental consequences were highly negative .
from the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1950s onwards , the Russian fleet was expanded and became the largest in the world with catches reaching their peak in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1970s .
fish became an important part of diet in Eastern Europe countries , with far lower consumption elsewhere in the regions .
commerci@@ alisation of the fisheries led to the almost complete loss of control by the EECCA countries over levels of catches and sizes of fle@@ ets .
in addition a significant part of the Russian fishing fleet withdraw from international waters and re@@ located to Russian seas , leading to increasing pressure on fish stocks in those fisheries .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
Ukraine is made up mostly of fertile plains , step@@ pes and plat@@ e@@ aux crossed by rivers , with one @@@ -@@ @ quarter of the country being classified as ' very productive ' .
in general , the recession of the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s saw an increase in the percentage of populations across the regions who were unable to secure an adequate diet .
under@@ nour@@ ishment became prevalent , particularly in the less wealthy countries .
at the same time there was a general reduction in environmental pressures arising from agriculture .
however , abandoned land , under@@ gra@@ zing and lack of capital to improve farm infrastructure also resulted in sh@@ rub encro@@ achment on flower @@@ -@@ @ rich grass@@ lands and a consequ@@ ent loss in biodiversity .
within the Caucasus , Armenia has many high @@@ -@@ @ rolling plat@@ e@@ aus and wide river valleys , with sharp mountains from the southern edge of the Caucasus .
food production is constrained by limited agricultural resources .
Azerbaijan is also a mountainous country characterised by a great variety of landscapes and climate zones .
Georgia also has a variety of landscapes , with forests covering around 40 % of its territory .
around 75 % of the summer past@@ ures lie in sub @@@ -@@ @ alpine and alpine regions , favour@@ ing certain types of livestock .
as described in Chapter 2 , economic growth has been rapid in most countries since the late 1990s .
in all sub @@@ -@@ @ regions , except Central Asia , expenditure on household consumption is higher now than it was prior to transition .
this has led to a general reduction in poverty and under @@@ -@@ @ nour@@ ishment , and the diets of some regions are beginning to turn towards meat products again ( for relevance of this point , see Box 5.2 ) .
the agricultural sector has not recovered to the same extent as the rest of the economy , and rising demand for food is being increasingly met by imports .
all these developments will have environmental , social and economic implications .

however , the country has been affected by two well @@@ -@@ @ known ecological disasters , namely , the reduction of the Aral Sea and the radioactive disaster of S@@ emi@@ pal@@ at@@ insk .
farming was restricted , due to sal@@ in@@ isation and radioactive contamination in these areas .
the food sector in Kyrgyzstan is shaped by the Ti@@ en Sh@@ an Mountains that divide the country ; and inadequate precipitation prevents most crop production without irrigation .
due to its limited arable land , livestock represents a large food production activity in the country .
Tajikistan is one of the most mountainous countries in the region - 93 % of its territory is mountainous with peaks reaching over 7 000 meters .

this transformation was , however , not widespread across EECCA and SE@@ E and most countries saw agricultural outputs decrease following transition .
trends in the output of the agricultural sector between 1992 and 2003 are shown in Figure 5.2 .
economic recovery since 1998 has generally been accompanied by relatively small increases in agricultural output ( Box 5.1 ) .
reforms in 1992 aimed to improve the economic efficiency of agricultural enterprises , but they failed to fully meet expectations .
most agricultural products today have lower levels of production than in the past .
the case study in the Ivano @@@ -@@ @ Fran@@ ki@@ vsk region revealed a fragile trade infrastructure in which producers do not effectively participate in the determin@@ aton of prices .

these include reducing energy consumption in the production and transportation of food , as well as increased food security .
however , income is not the only influencing factor in the proportion of income used to buy food - lifestyle , tradition , and preferences all play a role .
as can be seen from Table 5.1 , Russian house@@ holders produce significant quantities of their own food .

livestock farming can have other impacts . in many EECCA countries , over@@ gra@@ zing by sheep has also produced erosion and deser@@ tification .
in Central Asia 78 % of the water is polluted due to irrigated agriculture .

in the south of Kazakhstan un@@ treated drainage waters from irrigated fields affect an area of 900 000 ha .

they present potential environmental and health risks from leakage .
often , no one is willing to take responsibility for the removal and disposal of these stock@@ piles ( EEA , 2007 ) .
as higher incomes lead to increased meat consumption , the demands on water will intensify with the expected increase in livestock numbers and the production of animal feed .
as Box 5.2 shows , the production of meat and beef in particular puts a very high demand on water resources .
however , while the decline in fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er use and livestock numbers in EECCA have reduced pollution problems , practices in the use of fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and the treatment of man@@ ure in these countries are not environmentally sound ( EEA , 2003 ) .
moreover , in@@ organic fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er consumption is expected to increase in many EECCA countries in response to new market and export opportunities as has been seen in SE@@ E .
fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er and man@@ ure treatment may be an area that calls for policy attention ( EEA , 2007 ) .
biodiversity has been affected by both the expansion of agriculture in some areas and the abandoning of land in others .
land aband@@ onment or reduced gra@@ zing , on the other hand , affects more semi @@@ -@@ @ natural areas , especially species @@@ -@@ @ rich grass@@ lands .
for example , recent efforts in Armenia to increase food production have led to an increase in pesti@@ cide use .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
food products vary widely in terms of the environmental pressures they create along their full production chain .
this is particularly true where animals are fed with processed vegetable feeds rather than put to past@@ ure .
on average , 10 g of vegetable protein are needed to generate 1 g of animal protein ( Re@@ inj@@ ders and S@@ ore@@ t , 2003 ) .
inputs of fossil fuels are also much higher for meat than vegetables and are highest for beef .

the amount of water consumed in the production of foods is also significantly greater for meat than for vegetables or cereals .
the World Water Council ( 2004 ) and P@@ im@@ ent@@ el ( 1997 ) found the following differences :
all in all , the choice of diet has significant - if perhaps surprising - environmental implications , especially concerning energy and water use .
fisheries can cause significant pressure on marine and coastal ecosystems through a number of direct and indirect mechanisms .
fishing of the target species beyond sustainable limits and their effects on other species .
this leads to a drop in the stocks of the target species , but the ecosystem disruptions affect the rest of the food chain .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
food higher , up to approximately 30 % by weight in the Northeast Atlantic including the Barents Sea ( EEA , 2007 ) .
discard is lower in the Black Sea at approximately 4.9 % ( FAO , 2005 ) .
some species , for example shar@@ ks , are particularly vulnerable .
imports and exports of food products to and from EECCA countries decreased during the late @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , but have generally been on the increase since the beginning of this decade ( see Figure 5.3 ) .
the same is true of SE@@ E countries .
this growing international trade in food is likely to have led to an increase in environmental impacts from transportation .
besides transportation , deep @@@ -@@ @ freezing of vegetables and other products has increased , resulting in additional energy use ( see Box 5.3 ) .
destruction of the sea bed and ben@@ thic life through tr@@ aw@@ ling .
over@@ fishing and the resulting loss of catch have led to decreased investments in fishing fle@@ ets during the 1990s in the main northern Russia fishing ports .
employment in the fishing sector in these areas dropped by a third , causing impover@@ ishment within coastal communities already suffering from the effects of the recession ( M@@ ati@@ sh@@ ov et al . , 2004 ) .
this has also been the case in the coastal communities of the Black and Az@@ ov Seas ( EEA , 200@@ 5@@ a ) .
it is typical of global food markets that much of this transportation of food appears repetitive and unsustainable .
in many cases EECCA and SE@@ E countries are importing and exporting similar quantities of the same food products .
for example , cereals are one of the top three import and export products in all four sub @@@ -@@ @ regions and this is not only due to trade within the sub @@@ -@@ @ regions .
choice of food origin matters
box 5.2 described how meat and dairy production is much more energy and water intensive than vegetable and cere@@ al production .
the choice of a diet is therefore a key in determining the environmental pressures resulting from food consumption .
meat and vegetables from organic and intensive production were evaluated according to a set of environmental factors .
the energy used to transport food between countries can be high when compared to the energy content of the food itself .
for example , 97 calories of transport energy are needed to import one calorie of as@@ parag@@ us by plane from Chile to Europe , and 66 units of energy are consumed when flying 1 unit of carrot energy from South Africa to Europe ( Church , 2005 ) .
energy consumed when transporting food by ship or lor@@ ry is lower but in many cases requires additional cooling or freezing .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
leading to greater use of the car for shopping trips and expanded frequ@@ enting of large supermarkets .
impacts from transportation further increase with big supermarkets since they are more likely than local shops to stock imported foods .
5.3 Policies for sustainable food production and consumption
this section of the Chapter draws heavily on the responses provided by countries to the SC@@ P survey carried out by UNEP in 2007 , in support of this report ( see Table 5.2 ) .
Ag@@ ro@@ environmental strategies
on the other hand , house@@ holders ' own production of food appears , at least in Russia , to be significant .
together with preferences for local and national food products ( albeit not on environmental grounds ) , this may be having a positive social effect and reduce demand for transportation of food .
its positive implications for transport are dependent on how urban house@@ holders travel to their plots of land and d@@ ac@@ has .
traditionally , transport to d@@ ac@@ has , which lie anything from a few km to 100 km from city centres , was via electric trains and buses , but , increasingly , it now relies on private cars .
this leads to traffic cong@@ estion at weekends moving in and out of the larger cities , especially during the summer period .
as described in Chapter 8 , the average generation of municipal waste per capita in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries ( 250 @@@ -@@ @ 280 kil@@ os ) is still much lower than the average level in the EU of 550 kil@@ os per capita .
however , municipal waste collection has been growing rapidly in the EECCA countries since the late 1990s , as much as 8 @@@ -@@ @ 10 % annually in several countries .
EECCA and SE@@ E countries have committed themselves to the principles in the Convention of Biological Diversity ( CBD ) and the Regional Environmental Reconstruction Programme for Southeast Europe ( RE@@ Re@@ P ) .

in the SE@@ E countries the most important driving forces for facilitating food policy development are the St@@ abil@@ isation and approxim@@ ation Process ( SAP ) , institutional support from international organisations , and in some countries the drive for closer integration with the EU .

food presents a complex challenge for achieving sustainable consumption and production .
significant environmental impacts arise along the entire food production and use chain , from agriculture and fisheries , transportation , food processing and refri@@ geration and waste .
food is also a fundamental quality @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life issue , one which still has not yet been resolved .
in some countries access to and availability of foodstuffs remains a challenge for some social groups .
in others , unhealthy eating habits lead to health problems .
it is also a major economic issue in those countries which rely heavily on agriculture for their economic growth .
food production in SE@@ E and EECCA countries has been affected by a relative stagnation of the agricultural sector during the 1990s and early 2000s .
the total production volume declined in half of the countries , and there were mis@@ matches between food demand and production levels in many countries .
this and reductions in household incomes in most countries led to a drop in the consumption of cereals and meat .
legislation and technical documents on food quality , controls of inputs and handling of food products exist at various levels in all countries of the regions .
implementation of food quality control remains an issue in some countries , however .
for example , illegal sales of livestock products , vegetables , fruits , etc . , are a major income @@@ -@@ @ generator for many families , but this has in some cases led to the spread of diseases .
animals are often but@@ ch@@ ered without veterinary control , there are few slaugh@@ ter@@ houses with appropriate hygienic and sanitary conditions .

while this may have led to some reductions in environmental impacts , ag@@ ro@@ environmental problems of sal@@ in@@ isation , soil erosion , and contamination of surface water persist .
the challenge ahead consists in strengthening institutional capacity for delivering sustainable food consumption and production policies , including legislative enforcement mechanisms .

consumption of prepared and processed food as well as food imports have been increasing steadily since the end of the recession .

the opportunities to export organic food to meet the demand of EU markets are enormous , and some countries are already addressing this issue .
national markets for organic food will also offer opportunities as the awareness and purchasing capacity of consumers increase .
consumers interviewed in the case studies expressed preference for local production and concern with quality , preferences that could be further cultivated through consumer education campaigns promoting sustainably grown food .

facts and figures
residential , public and commercial buildings use around one @@@ -@@ @ third of total energy consumption in SE@@ E and EECCA .
energy use is dominated by heating and cooling , followed by hot water , appliances and lighting .
typically , 80 @@@ -@@ @ 90 % of total energy used during the whole life of a building is consumed during the use phase .
investment aimed at improving energy efficiency and heat loss during occupancy will give strong environmental and economic benefits over a building 's lifetime .
residential energy consumption per capita in EECCA is slightly higher than the EU average , and twice as high as the SE@@ E average .
it ranges from about 11 000 kWh in Russia to less than 600 kWh in Armenia .
household water consumption is generally significantly higher than EU averages .
distribution losses are high in the heating and water supply networks .
in Russia , for example , heat loss during distribution is estimated to be 20 % in some regions .
for water distribution , losses of 30 @@@ -@@ @ 50 % are typical in the SE@@ E and EECCA regions , and in some countries many water distribution systems are close to collapsing .
in SE@@ E , there is widespread use of electricity for heating and hot water in households .
reuse and recycling of demol@@ ition waste can be an effective measure for reducing the use of virgin construction materials in buildings .
this does not currently occur on any significant scale .

6.@@ 2.1 Historical background
moreover , it must optim@@ ise interactions with heating , electricity and water distribution systems in order to increase efficiencies .
urban construction from 1960 onwards largely consisted of low@@ - to medium @@@ -@@ @ rise multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment houses using a technique known as large @@@ -@@ @ panel construction .
across the Soviet Union , 75 % of all urban housing was built with these construction techniques ( Mol@@ n@@ ar , 2003 ) ( K@@ ly@@ ach@@ ko et al . , 2003 ) .
finally , the construction industry is one of the sectors that consumes the greatest amount of material resources .
housing built during this period had character@@ istically low levels of thermal efficiency .
panel @@@ -@@ @ built housing began to be phased out in the rest of Europe during the oil crises of the 1970s ( Mol@@ n@@ ar , 2003 ) .
in the Soviet Union construction of such housing continued with only minor improvements .
other waste@@ ful behaviour patterns in water and energy consumption can result from :
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
buildings heating ( i.e. wood and oil @@@ -@@ @ fired st@@ oves ) occurred in a
this gave no economic incentive to an occup@@ ant to save energy .
in any event , the typical apartment @@@ -@@ @ tenant had little or no way of controlling heating and temperatures other than by opening windows ( S@@ hap@@ iro , 2006 ) .
the economic up@@ turn in the regions during the late 1990s improved the financial situation of energy enterprises and increased the potential for full cost recovery .
nevertheless , ten years of zero investments have taken their toll on supply systems , and resources still remain limited for making the necessary improvements to reduce in@@ efficiencies .
furthermore , in many cases the ownership of utilities is still unclear , undermining incentives to invest in infrastructure .
the decade following the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the Soviet Union saw the gradual collapse of the energy and water supply as well as the distribution systems .
wars and turmoil in the former Yugoslavia had a similar effect on energy and water networks in SE@@ E .
however , this can only be achieved if carefully selected and enforced building codes are in place .
6.@@ 2.2 Tren@@ ds and out@@ looks
building stock and construction trends
the building of new dwell@@ ings has generally correspon@@ ded with the developments in GDP since 1990 ( Figure 6.1 ) .
for example , in Moscow 15 % of current dwell@@ ings were built after 1998 compared to 7 % in the rest of the country ( Mat@@ ro@@ sov , 2005 ) .
the costs for municipalities of supplying energy and water services increased with rising primary energy costs .
meanwhile , the possibility of transferring the real costs of energy and water supply to residential consumers was still unrealistic .
during the 1990s average incomes in the countries of the former Soviet Union dropped by 50 % while energy prices increased by 17@@ 7 % ( L@@ ampi@@ et@@ ti and Mey@@ er , 2002 ) .
the result was a long period of under @@@ -@@ @ investment during which supply and distribution systems deteriorated badly .
these increases have been encouraged by policies that raise sanitary norms for living spaces .
moreover , they have had positive social effects , although energy demand for space heating has consequently increased .
nevertheless , housing space remains low in the less affluent countries of Central Asia ( see Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 ) .
during the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s many governments in the EECCA and SE@@ E regions began a policy of intensive privatisation of state housing funds as well as the gradual privatisation of energy and water utilities .
this was encouraged by the international community ( 1 ) and accompanied in some cases by tariff increases .
privatisation and tariff increases were largely confined to electrical power , and were most progressive in SE@@ E countries .
however , energy prices also escal@@ ated in other places , such as Georgia , as did heating tariffs in Serbia .

figure 6.2 Production of key construction materials in EECCA countries
despite recent strong growth , the construction of new dwell@@ ings remains significantly below the high levels seen during the 1960 and 1980s .
it is approximately 60 % of 1990 construction levels in EE and CA , and 40 % in the Caucasus .
the housing stock of most cities remains dominated by dense developments of multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment buildings constructed during the 1960s and 1980s .
box 6.2 describes the stock of buildings in the five cities .
production of construction materials by weight across the EECCA region between 1990 and 2005 has closely followed developments in housing construction .
only cement production has enjoyed a higher growth than housing construction .
the relatively slower growth in the use of bricks , l@@ umber and pre@@ fabricated concrete modules may demonstrate changes in construction methods ( i.e. greater use of concrete ) , or an increase in the import of these construction materials .

like Dushanbe and Tbilisi , Ashgabat lies in an earthquake zone .
the city began to expand in earnest during the 1960s with the establishment of large panel multi @@@ -@@ @ storey designs able to withstand earthquakes .
the most intensive period of construction was between 1966 and the end of the 1980s .
some 70 % of the current housing stock consists of buildings 5 store@@ ys or higher .
current living space per person is approximately 12 m2 .
following a decision by the President in 1999 , emphasis has been placed on the construction of buildings of 7 @@@ -@@ @ 25 store@@ ys with large comfortable apartments , and / or offices and shopping space , etc .
of new dwelling construction , 64 % consist of multi @@@ -@@ @ storey apartment blocks , while 36 % are detached individual houses .
one @@@ -@@ @ third ( 33 % ) of apartment blocks are aimed at the luxury end of the market .
almost all new developments are privately constructed and owned .
municipal housing construction for disadvantaged groups has almost disappeared .
the entire city was not built until after 1922 and most of this since the development of an urban construction plan in 1956 .
by area , 98 % of the current stock are multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment buildings of 4 store@@ ys or more and 92 % are privately owned .
so far , new construction has not met the rigorous ambitions of the plan due to un@@ attractive loan conditions .
the involvement of international contractors may change this .
most of the housing stock has been built after World War II , with at least 80 % after 1960 .
by area , 20 % of all building space represents office space .
although the central area of the city is old , approximately 70 % of the building stock in the city was constructed between 1960 and 1990 . it consists of multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment blocks .
around 18 % of current dwell@@ ings are detached houses .
nearly two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of all buildings built in Georgia since 2000 are in Tbilisi .
construction rates were highest between 2000 and 2003 , but have now slowed .
the area of the average new apartment has been increasing and approximately 91 % are privately owned .
in 2002 , a major earthquake damaged more than 10 000 of the city 's buildings .
studies demonstrate that the reuse of demol@@ ition waste is unlikely to occur on a significant scale ( see Box 6.3 ) .
subsequently , during the 1990s apartments in such buildings were found to have high air concentrations of form@@ al@@ de@@ hy@@ de and phen@@ ol .

construction and demol@@ ition waste handling in t he five cities
in 1999 , the government recognised the opportunity to reduce the need for new construction materials by 40 % through recycling building waste .
construction companies are responsible for the disposal of demol@@ ition waste .
none of the 15 companies interviewed engages in recycling or reuse .
this is not economically viable due to ready availability of cheap materials .
the most pressing issue is ensuring that building waste is deposited according to law .
the remainder is illegally dum@@ ped .
by law , all residual building waste must be transported to a dedicated building waste disposal site .
the recycling of building waste is carried out ad hoc at the demol@@ ition site . construction companies may reuse some elements while the public also sc@@ av@@ eng@@ es .
no statistics are available on building wastes .
however , there is some reuse of reinforced concrete waste from multi @@@ -@@ @ storey housing .
the iron content is re@@ used for scrap and a part of the rub@@ ble used for road surfaces .
some wood wastes are taken away by local residents for heating .
there is only one building waste disposal site in the city that collects 120 @@@ -@@ @ 150 thousand m3 per year .
as with the other cities , no reuse of building waste takes place at the official disposal site .
an attempt was made in 2002 by a foreign firm to set up a recycling plant . however , it was abandoned shortly afterwards .
as in the other cities , ad hoc recycling of windows , flo@@ or@@ boards , tiles , etc. is happening at demol@@ ition sites by city dwellers for use in their homes .
across EECCA and SE@@ E residential , public and commercial buildings consume around one @@@ -@@ @ third of total final energy consumption ( Figure 6.3 ) .
this compares very closely to the EU @@@ -@@ @ 25 .
however , there are significant differences across individual countries , with the share of buildings in total energy consumption ranging from approximately 12 % of the total in Armenia to 50 % or more in Georgia , Moldova and Uzbekistan .
average residential energy consumption per capita across EECCA ( Figure 6.4 ) has declined since 1994 despite economic growth due mostly to drops in Russia and Ukraine .

ownership of electrical appliances is generally significantly lower in SE@@ E and EECCA countries than in the rest of Europe .
these proportions may also be typical for SE@@ E ( 4 ) .
across EECCA as a whole , heat from district heating systems represents 45 % of total final energy consumption in households .
this is significantly higher than in SE@@ E or the EU and is largely due to Eastern Europe .
natural gas is the other main energy carrier consumed directly in households across EECCA .
compared with energy consumption , the share of water consumption in buildings in EECCA and SE@@ E is less significant than the share of other sectors .

appliances : appliance ownership stagn@@ ated or even declined in most EECCA countries during the 1990s and early 2000s , as appliances bought during the 1980s fell into dis@@ repair .
it is expected that growth in appliance ownership will follow . ownership of high @@@ -@@ @ end appliances is highest in cities ( 10 ) .
water consumption for the residential and services sector in EECCA fell by 20 % between 1990 and 2000 and has remained stable since then ( EEA , 2007 ) .
in Russia , residential water consumption per capita dropped from 30@@ 4 lit@@ res / day in 1995 to 2@@ 47 lit@@ res / day in 2005 ( UNEP , 2006 ) .
in Tbilisi and Ashgabat water consumption per capita is 800 and 700 lit@@ res / day respectively .
due to high losses and lack of available water , water services in many cities are ration@@ ed ( 6 ) .
greater ownership will be accompanied by increasing electricity consumption unless the efficiency of appliances improves at similar rates .
in conclusion , energy consumption per capita in buildings is high in Eastern Europe ( excluding Moldova ) , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan , and to a lesser extent Azerbaijan , Croatia and Serbia .
some countries in the regions still have very low residential energy use per capita .
water consumption , meanwhile , appears to be higher than EU averages in most of SE@@ E and EECCA .
there are three kinds of heating for urban households , commercial and public buildings across the regions .
expected trends in future consumption of energy and water
district heating ( D@@ H ) - supplying hundreds or thousands of homes and public buildings .
heat is generated at one or two central boiler stations and supplemented by many small boilers .
the large boilers burn fossil fuels or occasionally waste or biomass .
Autonomous building @@@ -@@ @ level heating - central boilers in multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment or commercial / public buildings which provide heat to all apartments .
these boilers tend to burn gas or oil .
individual heating - apartment @@@ -@@ @ level heating using gas he@@ aters , wood st@@ oves or electric he@@ aters .
for apartment tenants not connected to district heating , energy consumption for heating is limited by income .
where average incomes rise , consumption increases .
increasing incomes may also encourage a switch in fuel types from ker@@ os@@ ene or wood to electricity or gas for heating and hot water ( 7 ) .

sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
box 6.4 ) . in Kazakhstan most new multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment buildings also have autonomous heating systems .
heating systems in the five cities
the heating systems in the five cities vary widely .
in Minsk 9@@ 9.@@ 6 % of all multi @@@ -@@ @ storey residential buildings are connected to district heating .
the figure is 75 % in Dnipropetrovsk , with 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 % of households having autonomous heating and the remaining 5 @@@ -@@ @ 10 % using apartment level boilers .
approximately 30 % of the buildings in Dushanbe are connected to the D@@ H system with other buildings using autonomous systems powered by diesel .
about 20 % of heat in Dnipropetrovsk is from C@@ HP or industrial waste heat , with the remainder from heat @@@ -@@ @ only boilers .
the fuel used for C@@ HP and heat @@@ -@@ @ only boilers in Dnipropetrovsk is around 80 % gas and 20 % coal .
at the beginning of the 1990s , Tbilisi had a large D@@ H network with 85 % of buildings connected to it .
this network closed down when the gas supply to the city was dis@@ continued .
the population turned to ker@@ os@@ ene or electricity for heating .
by the time the gas supply returned in 1996 , the D@@ H system was in total dis@@ repair .
residents turned to apartment @@@ -@@ @ level gas connections for heating and cooking .
in Ashgabat there is no large D@@ H or C@@ HP .
however , approximately 95 % of buildings have autonomous heating either for a single building or for small groups of buildings , while new buildings are regularly fitted with autonomous heating .

6.@@ 2.4 Key driving forces in energy and water consumption
even new buildings are being built with low thermal efficiency .
while a number of countries have updated building codes for new buildings ( see Section 6.@@ 3.2 ) , several still use construction norms and regulations ( S@@ Ni@@ P ) dating back to the Soviet period .
energy efficiency in Ukraine 's housing stock is 3 @@@ -@@ @ 5 times lower than that of western countries ( Kop@@ ets , 2006 ) . heat loss in buildings in Kazakhstan is 50 @@@ -@@ @ 60 % higher than in developed countries under comparable conditions ( Energy Charter Secretariat , 200@@ 6@@ b ) .
there is also evidence that even these building codes are not being complied with by contractors ( 13 ) .
part of the reason for this is the large climatic differences across the region .
while this may explain differences in residential energy consumption in Russia , Ukraine and Belarus , it does not explain the much greater disparities between these countries and Armenia or Georgia .
there are some 18@@ 0,000 km of district heating pipes in Russia alone , many of which are not insulated , leak or are broken .
currently only 250 @@@ -@@ @ 300 km , i.e. ~ 0.@@ 15 % is being replaced annually , compared to the minimum requirement of 4 % which is needed to keep the networks running .
Ros@@ stat estimates heat loss is close to 20 % in some regions ( Mil@@ ov , 2006 ) .
for water distribution , losses of 30 @@@ -@@ @ 50 % are typical in the regions .
losses in Croatia are estimated at 50 % ( EBRD , 2001 ) , while Russia 's Federal Agency for Water Resources reports losses of 30 @@@ -@@ @ 40 % for its tap water during distribution ( 14 ) .
many water distribution systems are close to collapse .
approximately 60 % of the network is worn out in Moldova ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) and in Russia 40 to 70 % of the systems are in need of replacement .
the district heating systems inherited from the Soviet Union are largely inefficient due to poor design , lack of maintenance and losses in distribution .
in contrast , countries with no D@@ H , where house@@ holders purchase fuel for heating by the unit , and fuel prices are high ( e.g. Georgia and Armenia ) , economic hardship has had a direct effect on consumption .
house@@ holders have cut costs by heating only those rooms in use and maintaining them at low temperatures during the winter .
most countries are in the process of raising tariffs .
currently , tariffs are closest to recovering the full cost for electric power , and far@@ th@@ est for water ( F@@ ank@@ ha@@ user and T@@ epic , 2005 ) .
moreover , non @@@ -@@ @ payment rates are high which can lead to financial crises for energy enterprises and limit their ability to fund improvements . curi@@ ously this
) Some buildings constructed during the 1990s in Tbilisi have been found to have heating requirements 30 % greater than that required by the S@@ Ni@@ P .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
the earlier high levels of subsidies have created the impression that the water supply , in particular , comes without any economic and environmental costs .
non ‑ affor@@ d@@ ability - costs for electricity services are above affor@@ d@@ ability thresholds ( 15 ) for the 10 % of the population with the lowest incomes in both F@@ Y@@ R of Macedonia and Croatia .
heating service costs are close to affor@@ d@@ ability thresholds in Serbia and Montenegro and Kyrgyzstan , and likewise for water in Russia and Tajikistan ( F@@ ank@@ ha@@ user and T@@ epic , 2005 ) .
elsewhere , affor@@ d@@ ability is not an issue due to subsi@@ dis@@ ed tariffs .
inability to control consumption and costs - there is not a lot of willingness to pay higher costs when one has no control over them .
this may explain why non @@@ -@@ @ payment is lowest for electricity for which payment according to use is widespread ( see below ) .
dissatisfaction - willingness to pay is critically affected by the quality of the service .
met@@ ering and payment according to use at the apartment level are most common for electricity and gas ( see Box 6.5 ) .
status of met@@ ering in the five cities
electricity meters are provided at apartment level in all five cities .
in Minsk , Dushanbe and Dnipropetrovsk , 100 % of apartments are equipped with individual electricity meters , whereas the figures are 93 % and 90 % in Tbilisi and Ashgabat , respectively .
met@@ ering for heat and water in Minsk and Dnipropetrovsk depends on the age of the building .
water and heat are provided only at building level for older buildings in Minsk , with all buildings constructed since 2002 having apartment @@@ -@@ @ level met@@ ering .
this is similar to the situation in Dnipropetrovsk , although older buildings are also gradually being equipped with apartment level meters under the ' Programme on Re@@ structuring and Development of Hou@@ se@@ holds ' .
there is no met@@ ering of heating in Dushanbe even in newly constructed buildings .
in Tbilisi and Dushanbe there is no residential water met@@ ering even at the building level , although most commercial buildings are met@@ ered .
the same is true in Ashgabat , since water is provided free and in unlimited quantity .
while gas in Ashgabat is un@@ met@@ ered in older buildings , meters are commonly installed in new buildings at apartment level .
in Tbilisi gas is 100 % met@@ ered .
15 ) F@@ ank@@ ha@@ user and T@@ epic ( 2005 ) , based on a review of studies , suggest affor@@ d@@ ability thresholds of 10 % for electricity , 10 % for heat
in Russia Bash@@ m@@ akov ( 2006 ) has identified two sets of thresholds .
the first , when exceeded , will lead to a declining payment discipline which he sets at 7 % for combined services .
( demand exceeded capacity ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
the proportion of primary energy consumption attributed to buildings is typically even higher ( 19 ) .
6.@@ 2.5 Environmental and social impacts
in countries with high levels of final residential energy consumption and with high dependency on fossil fuels , direct and indirect carbon dioxide and other emissions per capita related to residential energy consumption are considerably higher .
the construction sector is one of the biggest consumers of raw materials , other than fossil fuels , in most countries .
the impacts of extraction and fabrication of construction materials in EECCA and SE@@ E countries are not documented , but it can be assumed to have impacts on land use , impacts related to energy and water consumption and to generation of quar@@ rying waste .
the environmental impact of the use phase of buildings mainly relate to pressures arising from primary fossil fuel use either directly in buildings or at power stations and district heat plants .
these pressures include the emission of gases which contribute to climate change , aci@@ di@@ fication and tro@@ pos@@ pheric ozone production .
( 20 ) 40 % of heat to D@@ H systems in Kazakhstan is produced by C@@ HP ( Energy Charter Secretariat , 200@@ 6@@ b ) . ( 21 ) ~ 30 % of heat to D@@ H systems in Russia is produced by C@@ HP ( Pi@@ erce , 2004 ) .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
district heating fed by combined heat and power or industrial waste heat
the potential for environmental benefits is particularly high for those countries which currently use very high levels of fossil fuel energy : Belarus , Kazakhstan , Russian Federation , Turkmenistan , Ukraine and Uzbekistan .
the following opportunities exist to reduce final energy and water consumption :
• taking advantage of the current construction boom throughout the region by ensuring that new buildings are built to stricter thermal standards than previously , and with efficient heat distribution systems ;
meanwhile , high water consumption has the most serious environmental effects in countries with high levels of water stress ( the ratio of water abstraction to fresh water supplies ) .
three EECCA countries , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan , have the highest levels of water stress across pan @@@ -@@ @ Europe ( EEA , 2007 ) .
thermal efficiency rehabilitation and heating system modernisation of the existing building stock , possibly to be financed by mobil@@ ising future cost savings ;
• provision of technical expertise and funding for modernisation of energy and water distribution networks ;
• furn@@ ishing house@@ holders with information on how to reduce waste@@ ful practices and providing economic incentives to encourage this , i.e. by extending met@@ ering and payment by use at the household level ;
the social impacts of low thermal efficiency in housing have been significant for lower income groups in those countries with little or no district heating .
this was particularly in evidence in Moldova , Armenia and Azerbaijan during the late 1990s where many tenants heated their houses to survival levels only .
introducing energy lab@@ elling in electrical appliances to promote greater efficiency and / or introducing minimum energy efficiency standards for appliances .
considerable savings in primary energy use and environmental pressures can be achieved through efforts to move up the energy hierarchy ( see Figure 6.7 ) including :
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
• programme , ' Im@@ proving Energy efficiencies of City Heating and Hot Water Systems ' .
• encouraging a switch to fuels with higher cal@@ ori@@ fic values , or to biomass or waste , in large heating boilers / co @@@ -@@ @ generation plants .
in Ukraine , the Law on Energy Conservation provides a comprehensive set of actions .
there are also considerable opportunities for the construction industry to reduce raw material extraction by encouraging the greater recycling of building and demol@@ ition waste .
in some countries of the EU the vast majority of demol@@ ition waste is recycled within the construction industry .
for example , Denmark and the Netherlands rec@@ ycle or reuse 90 % of building and demol@@ ition waste , while Germany recy@@ cles or re@@ uses around 70 % .
6.@@ 3.2 National policies and legislation
policies for the efficient use of energy in buildings are usually included in more general energy efficiency programmes under national energy strategies .
it is not clear , however , to what extent energy efficiency policies are implemented in practice .
there are several such examples of implementation failures due to a lack of institutional capacity , a shortage of fiscal / budgetary resources or inadequate political will ( 22 ) .
policies and strategies on more sustainable sources of heat and power
Moldova 's energy strategy includes a goal of reducing energy intensity by 2 @@@ -@@ @ 3 % annually between 2003 and 2010 ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) .
Croatia 's centr@@ alised Ther@@ mal Systems Energy Eff@@ iciency Program encourages the development and enhancement of district heating in areas with a high density of heat or heat and electricity consumers ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) .
a few countries have policies or programmes aimed at the residential / buildings sector and / or district heating .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
however , the government has considered adoption of the European label ( Har@@ r@@ ington and Dam@@ n@@ ics , 2001 ) .
recent Armenian legislation on the Ren@@ ew@@ able Energy and Energy Eff@@ iciency Programme requires energy lab@@ elling for appliances ( M@@ UNE@@ E , 2007 ) .
energy lab@@ elling is more widespread in SE@@ E .
the Albanian Energy Eff@@ iciency Law also makes energy lab@@ elling of appliances mandatory ( Hi@@ do , 2005 ) .
one objective of Macedonia 's National Development Strategy is to shift residential heating from electricity to gas in order to reduce primary energy consumption .
just such a shift was achieved in the principal cities of Georgia by tri@@ pling national tariffs on electricity and ker@@ os@@ ene , but not on gas ( World Bank , 2003 ) .
in the early 2000s in Serbia electricity rate increases and joint government / international donor projects encouraged 10 % of households to switch from electricity to other energy sources for heating ( 23 ) .
one current gap in the promotion of the heating hierarchy is a lack of building or planning regulations .
this would either require new buildings to be connected to existing D@@ H networks or require the supply of autonomous rather than individual apartment @@@ -@@ @ based heating systems .
the latter two functions require met@@ ering and payment by use .
new building energy codes ( e.g. those introduced since 2000 ) have been developed in Albania , Armenia , Croatia , Kazakhstan , Russian Federation , Tajikistan , and Ukraine .
new codes are being considered in Georgia and Moldova .
tariff increases for electricity have progressed most rapidly in SE@@ E countries but also in Georgia , Armenia and Moldova .
a number of countries still have laws that do not allow municipalities or privati@@ sed enterprises to raise tariffs unilaterally ( 24 ) .
it provides thermal efficiency standards for new and renovated buildings , so that the energy consumption is at least 35 % lower than in older buildings .
it also provides technical assistance to architects and contractors on how to construct high @@@ -@@ @ efficiency buildings .
it seeks to ensure compliance with codes by requiring energy audits and gives guidance on carrying out energy audits as well as identifying retro@@ fit measures for old buildings .

in Turkmenistan , electricity and gas are provided free to households up to limits of 5@@ 30 kWh and 600 m3 per year per family member .
households have to pay a fee per unit used over these limits ( city study ) .
the three bands originally introduced were as follows : 0 @@@ -@@ @ 7 200 kWh ; 7 200 @@@ -@@ @ 19 200 kWh ; and over 19 200 kWh per household ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) .
the lower tariff band was very broad and covered consumption of 70 % of households .
it did not provide much incentive for reducing consumption and was subsequently revised to 0 @@@ -@@ @ 4 200 kWh per household ( S@@ IE@@ PA , 2005 ) .
there is also a block tariff system in place in Georgia with the following three bands : 0 @@@ -@@ @ 1 200 kWh ; 1 200 @@@ -@@ @ 3 600 kWh ; and over 3 600 kWh per household per year ( city study ) .

a USAID / Alliance to Save Energy @@@ -@@ @ financed project was begun in 2001 to identify measures to improve the financial status of district heating enterprises .
the cost @@@ -@@ @ effectiveness of district heating supplied by C@@ HP versus autonomous ( building @@@ -@@ @ based ) heating was assessed for a number of cities ( Kal@@ k@@ um , 2002 ) .

in 2003 , the Albanian National Agency for Energy ( n@@ ae ) funded feasibility studies for two new C@@ HP schemes - one for the largest hospital in Albania ( Mother Ter@@ esa Hospital ) and one for the campus of Tir@@ ana University .
C@@ HP or waste heat from industry in the D@@ H system should dramatically improve cost effectiveness .

• refurb@@ ishment of heating boilers ( where the building is not connected to D@@ H ) ;
• introduction of a heat ex@@ changer between the D@@ H and building circulation .
retro@@ fitting at the apartment level can include :
• improved sealing of windows and doors ( we@@ ather@@ isation ) ;
the new Russian building codes mentioned earlier include mandatory energy lab@@ elling for new and renovated buildings .
the two upper bands ( A and B ) in the five band lab@@ elling system are for low and very low energy buildings , which go beyond mandatory efficiency requirements for a new building .
this has the potential to provide incentives for innovative high efficiency technologies .
however , to encourage the full spectrum of innovative technologies the Russian codes need to be extended to cover hot water systems and lighting .
a number of initiatives have been completed or are under way in SE@@ E and EECCA countries using innovative technology for buildings ( see Box 6.@@ 10 ) .
use of ge@@ other@@ mal energy is being investigated especially in the SE@@ E region .
there is also an opportunity for innovative efficient cooling for buildings in Central Asia and SE@@ E .
retro@@ fitting of existing buildings
a World Bank project in Cher@@ epo@@ vets , Russia , retro@@ fitted 6@@ 63 buildings to improve thermal efficiency during the late 1990s .
a feasibility project in Uz@@ h@@ gorod in Ukraine found similar overall savings available from retro@@ fitting ( Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bach and Luk@@ sha , 2006 ) .
measures were identified which would yield savings of between 36 % and 64 % , depending on the housing type .

greatest energy savings were achieved through thermal insulation of external walls , followed by the insulation of roofs and terraces ( Rec@@ over , 2005 ) .
retro@@ fitting of two multi ‑ apartment buildings , Lviv ,
this project funded by the Alliance to Save Energy ( ASE ) retro@@ fitted the heating systems of two multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment buildings with hot water and heating controls for each apartment and accompanying met@@ ering systems .

pay@@ back times for the projects identified in Uz@@ h@@ gorod in all cases exceeded ten years due to low tariffs and the high cost of imported insulation .
a future major source of funding for four countries in the region ( Russia , Belarus , Ukraine and Croatia ) could be the Joint Implementation ( J@@ I ) scheme under the Kyoto Protocol .
the main focus for J@@ I is likely to shift from the new EU Member States to Ukraine and Russia .
Russia has the largest potential for J@@ I projects among all eligible countries ( IC@@ FI , 2006 ) .
there are , however , considerable institutional barriers in many EECCA and SE@@ E countries which can make funding un@@ attractive to donors and international investors .
in existing buildings , retro@@ fitting programmes can gradually introduce met@@ ering or heat cost allocation devices and control at apartment level .
for example , in Poland heat met@@ ering began to increase rapidly when the obligation for installation was transferred from building owners to district heating companies ( 30 ) .
in the short term building @@@ -@@ @ level meters could be installed and residents ' associations established to discourage waste@@ ful habits .

Bank loans are unlikely direct sources of funding for retro@@ fitting of multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment buildings unless the con@@ dom@@ inium or residents ' association has external support .
this is due to the high level of risk for the lender and correspondingly high interest rates ( UNDP , 2005 ) .
to date J@@ I financing has only been used for large projects .
the mechanism is very suited to refurb@@ ishment and modern@@ ising of D@@ H systems , but may be less appropriate for financing retro@@ fitting of multi @@@ -@@ @ apartment buildings .
an alternative mechanism under the Kyoto protocol is emissions trading of so @@@ -@@ @ called As@@ sign A@@ mount Un@@ its ( A@@ AU ) .
improving the finances of energy and water enterprises
external support for residents ' associations can come in the form of state or municipal collateral or grants to supplement bank loans .
in return , the municipality can receive part of the energy cost savings .
however , many municipalities do not have the budgetary autonomy that would enable them to keep these energy @@@ -@@ @ cost savings ( 32 ) .
an alternative model is the Energy Services Company ( E@@ SCO ) and performance @@@ -@@ @ based contracting ( Box 6.@@ 14 ) .
providing an environment in which ESC@@ Os can thrive requires governments to take three key measures :
a promise of improvements in services is necessary to tackle non @@@ -@@ @ payment problems in situations with rising tariffs .
information campaigns are necessary to convey the service improvement plan to consumers and explain why increases in tariffs are necessary .
consumers will react much more positively towards increasing tariffs if they can control their costs .
this requires installation of apartment level met@@ ering .
in Tbilisi , electricity services have been considerably improved along with a quadru@@ pling in tariffs between 1997 and 2003 .
meanwhile , in the city of Rust@@ avi 16 @@@ -@@ @ hour electricity stop@@ pages were common during the 1990s .
four out of five households did not have electricity meters and non @@@ -@@ @ payment was high .
in 2003 , the United Energy Electr@@ icity Company with US A@@ ID help offered residents the choice of paying USD 16 for installation of a meter or staying without electricity .
today residents in Rust@@ avi enjoy a 24 @@@ -@@ @ hour electricity supply and payment rates have quadru@@ pled .
meanwhile , consumption per household has declined by 50 % due to household electricity conservation ( USAID , 2006 ) .

box 6.@@ 14 The role of Energy Service Companies ( ESC@@ Os )
ESC@@ Os and energy performance contracts have played an important role in promoting energy efficiency in many developing states including a number of transitional countries .
the model has been used with considerable success in the Czech Republic , and to a lesser extent , in Ukraine and Russia ( Ev@@ ans , 2001 ) .
ESC@@ Os can provide a number of services to residential and commercial building retro@@ fitting projects , including feasibility studies , project management , financing , installation , and follow @@@ -@@ @ up with maintenance and monitoring .
ESC@@ Os will generally accept payment through energy savings following retro@@ fit .
some ESC@@ Os are large enough and have sufficient liquidity to finance projects themselves .
an example is the state @@@ -@@ @ owned Ukrainian Energy Services Company ( Ukr@@ E@@ sc@@ o ) which has access to loans and grants from the EBRD and the EU 's technical assistance programme ( T@@ AC@@ IS ) ( Ev@@ ans , 2001 ) .
in most cases , however , ESC@@ Os need third @@@ -@@ @ party financing to implement the project , usually from commercial banks .
• arrange training for engineering companies , banks , government officials and consumers ; and
• provide seed financing , including provision of guarantees , to stimulate the initial growth of the market ( Ev@@ ans , 2001 ) .
annual residential final energy consumption per capita varies from 11 000 kWh in Russia to just 600 kWh in Armenia .
differences between greenhouse gas emissions related to residential energy use are even greater since most countries with low residential energy consumption also have high levels of renewable electricity production .
water consumption in buildings is high throughout the whole region .

facts and figures
freight movement declined significantly between 1990 and 2000 after an initial rise during the period 1970 @@@ -@@ @ 1990 .
since 2000 the amount of freight transported in SE@@ E and EE has begun to increase again .
in some countries , transport , especially freight transport , has now recovered and is currently above 1990 levels .
the use of transport - both freight and passenger - is expected to increase substantially in the near future .
in EECCA , rail transport accounts for the greatest proportion of freight moved .
in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , rail freight has generally maintained a similar share of the freight market ( e.g. at least 80 % ) since 1970 .
the proportion of freight transported by rail is in decline in the SE@@ E , although it is still generally higher than the equivalent figure in Western Europe , which was less than 15 % in 2004 .
the use of public passenger transport ( rail , buses and coaches ) experienced a significant increase in use between 1970 and 1990 , followed by a substantial decline between 1990 and 2000 .
the use of private cars for transport has increased significantly over the last decade .
one of the main impacts of transport is energy use and emissions of carbon dioxide ; the main greenhouse gas that causes climate change .
air pollution in the countries of SE@@ E and EECCA is now becoming a serious problem , particularly in urban areas .
pollution is exacerbated by the age of the vehicles , poor vehicle maintenance , variable fuel quality , and the poor condition of many of the roads .
lead@@ ed petrol has been phased out in many SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
where lead@@ ed petrol is still in use , plans for its ph@@ asing out will be made in the coming years .
in many countries there are also plans to improve vehicle emission and fuel quality standards .

it also minim@@ ises adverse impacts on human health and the environment , e.g. pollution and contributions to climate change , or waste generation .
in fact , for many Europeans a high level of mobility is no longer just a convenience but rather a basic need .
this chapter first reviews existing transport trends in SE@@ E and EECCA countries , within both the freight and passenger transport sectors .
it then explo@@ res the reasons behind these trends and gives an overview of the adverse environmental and social consequences that result .
in the past 15 years , the transport systems of SE@@ E and EECCA have reflected the broader developments in the histories of the countries of these regions .
the depth and duration of the recession varied significantly from one country to another but most countries suffered for much or all of the 1990s .
while some have now returned to quite significant economic growth , others have barely recovered their position from 1990 in terms of GDP per capita .
the chapter concludes by identifying common issues and barriers faced by the countries of the region , followed by potential opportunities , given their particular circumstances .

although this figure is 25 % below the peak of 1985 , it is still approximately 10 % higher than in the early 1990s .
as recently as 1998 , Armenia and Azerbaijan each had over 40 km of tram@@ ways in their major cities .
however , passenger numbers peaked at , respectively , 30 and 40 million people a year a decade earlier .
subsequently , declining services had brought about a steady decrease in tram use , which led to the tr@@ ams hal@@ ting all operations by 2005 .

in addition , air freight transport accounts for a marginal share ( fraction of a percent ) of total freight in EECCA and SE@@ E countries .
however , the initial amount of air freight was low from the outset .
7.@@ 2.2 The reasons behind changing consumption patterns
future projections
inevitably , it is anticipated that the use of transport - both freight and passenger - will increase
as noted above , transport trends have broadly followed trends in GDP .
the decline and recovery of economic activity was reflected in the level of
growth in air traffic versus aviation safety
commercial aviation has experienced enormous growth over the last few decades .
despite bringing socioeconomic benefits , this has led to increased environmental impacts .
the rapid growth of small carriers also raises safety concerns .
in 2006 , Russia and the other former Soviet republics had the world 's worst air traffic safety record .
according to the International Air Transport Association ( I@@ ATA ) , the accident rate in EECCA region was 13 times the world average .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
see countries have seen greater investment in public transport , as networks have been maintained , and in some cases , e.g. in Zagreb ( see Box 7.1 ) , even expanded .
national rail networks have also suffered .
this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the locomotives and rolling stock are old and in poor condition .
all of these factors contribute to a reduction in the operational capacity of the network and in the speed of operations ( World Bank , 2004 ) .
in the EECCA countries , the situation is often similar , e.g. in Armenia the railway infrastructure is also in a relatively poor condition ( Ts@@ ar@@ uk@@ yan , 2006 ) .
to some extent the recent increase in car ownership only satis@@ fies a latent demand .
previously people in many EECCA countries had to wait many years before being able to purchase cars .
as wealth has increased and imported second @@@ -@@ @ hand cars have become more readily available , car ownership has soared .
this situation is particularly per@@ tinent for SE@@ E and EECCA countries . finally , cars are a necessity in rural areas , where the quality of public transport has declined .
road networks in SE@@ E and EECCA countries also lack investment , despite the fact that they have attracted far more investment than railways or any other forms of public transport .
for example , the public transport systems of the EECCA countries were previously state @@@ -@@ @ owned and heavily subsi@@ dis@@ ed .
the subsequent transfer of ownership of much local public transport to municipalities was not accompanied by sufficient levels of funding .
consequently , the quality and quantity of public transport has declined , as has investment in the maintenance of the fleet and infrastructure .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
the decline of state ‑ owned public transport and th e rise of private operators
in the Russian Federation , public transport still has an 85 % to 90 % share of the market in urban areas despite recent increases in car ownership .
the Russian public transport system is one of the largest in the world , but the system is currently suffering in the same way as elsewhere in EECCA .
the level of service is declining , due to a lack of investment in vehicles both to replace older vehicles and also to meet new demand .
it is estimated that only 25 % of the required annual investment in new vehicles is being funded .
statistics suggest that the level of public transport subsidy in the Russian Federation is still significant - around EUR 3@@ 51 million in 2000 - and increasing compared to recent years .
but it is also estimated that the subsidy is still less than what is needed to cover operational costs , not to mention investment in new vehicles .
the relative decline of the state @@@ -@@ @ owned public transport system has given rise to a growing number of private operators , usually operating mini@@ buses , in many Russian cities .
additionally , such mini@@ buses tend to be well utilis@@ ed and thus more environmentally efficient than private car use .
the rise of privately @@@ -@@ @ owned public transport services is not a development limited to Russian cities .
in Yerevan , for example , publicly @@@ -@@ @ owned bus and tram services have declined due to a lack of financial support and poor infrastructure .
some of the shortfall has been compensated for by increases in the numbers of smaller privately @@@ -@@ @ owned buses and taxis .
in Tbilisi , it is a similar story .
a public transport system from the Soviet period , which focused on large buses and electric public transport ( trol@@ ley@@ buses , underground subway and tr@@ ams ) , collapsed post @@@ -@@ @ 1990 due to financial constraints .
while bus services have begun to recover , the use of the metro and tr@@ ams continues to decline .
however , similar concerns have been raised about the lack of regulation of the sector ( Georgian Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources , 2006 ) .
of Albania 's national road network was considered to meet this standard and 68 % was judged to be poor .
in Armenia , major roads of national and regional importance are in relatively good condition , while local roads tend to be in a much poorer state ( Ts@@ ar@@ uk@@ yan , 2006 ) .
7.@@ 2.3 The impacts of transport
compared to public transport , it is much easier to attract investment for roads .
this section reviews some of the key environmental impacts originating in the transport sector , as well as one dramatic social aspect - road accidents .
transport depends on fossil fuels , particularly oil products , which account for more than 98 % of
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
transport energy consumption per capita ( tonnes of oil equivalent ) in SE@@ E and EECCA countries ( 2004 )
South Eastern Europe
Portugal ( lowest in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 )
source : EEA , 2007 .
the consumption of transport energy per capita declined in all the EECCA countries ( except Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan ) between 1995 and 2004 .
mechan@@ ised transport gives rise to pollution in a number of forms , including emissions of carbon dioxide ; one of the main greenhouse gases associated with the combustion of fossil fuels .
other forms of pollution include exhaust gases and particul@@ ates that contribute to local and regional pollution , dust from tyres and brakes , noise etc .
generally speaking , more modern vehicles tend to be less poll@@ uting than older ones owing to more sophisticated pollution control technology and the use of cleaner fuels .
air pollution in the countries of SE@@ E and EECCA is more and more of a problem , particularly in urban areas .
to some extent , the situation improved in the 1990s , principally as a result of the decline of the economy in EECCA and the subsequent reduction in emissions from both industry and transport .
however , the growth of road transport in recent years has seen urban air quality deteriorate once again .
air quality in the cities of SE@@ E and EECCA
in Almaty reported ozone levels were more than four times higher than national and international standards , while fine dust was 1.@@ 25 times above international standards ( Ko@@ k and de K@@ oning , 2003 ) .
the same C@@ AN@@ NOT be said of other cities in Belarus - pollution levels in Vitebsk and Gomel are considered to be high ( Nar@@ k@@ ev@@ itch , 2006 ) .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
pollution is exacerbated by vehicle age , poor vehicle maintenance , variable fuel quality , and the poor state of many of the roads ( see Box 7.4 ) .
transport vehicles are an attractive proposition for recycling since vehicles tend to be made largely out of steel , and it is generally economical to rec@@ ycle them even without special requirements to do so .
however , other elements of more complex vehicles , such as passenger cars , can be more difficult to rec@@ ycle .
modern construction methods , for example , the use of plastics , lam@@ inated compounds and other novel materials , can complicate these problems .
as a result , there are few examples of action taken specifically to reduce noise from transport .
the problem of noise is made worse by similar factors that contribute to excessive emissions , i.e. the age of the vehicles and poor maintenance of vehicles and roads .
in addition , some toxic materials including heavy metals are used in vehicle construction and need to be disposed of with due care .
impacts of transport infrastructure
while the number of accidents has increased to levels comparable to those of the early 1990s , the number of road deaths is still lower than it was in 1990 .
transport infrastructure can also make significant demands upon non @@@ -@@ @ renewable resources , especially in situations , such as those now occurring in some SE@@ E and EECCA countries , where major new infrastructure is under construction .
new infrastructure requires significant quantities of mineral resources , including concrete , aggre@@ gates , and steel .
roads , and to a lesser extent railways , can fragment natural habitats by acting as a significant barrier to the movement of small animals , while noise and other impacts of transport activities can disturb wild animals .
in urban areas heavily @@@ -@@ @ used new infrastructure can also have a negative impact on the mobility of people within cities .
transport infrastructure also takes land - a natural resource - that could be used for other

7.@@ 2.4 Other factors determining impacts of transport fle@@ ets in many EECCA countries consist of older vehicles manufactured in the former Soviet Union , and of newer vehicles , many of them second @@@ -@@ @ hand and imported from Germany and elsewhere ( see Box 7.5 ) .
vehicles produced in the former Soviet Union tend to use petrol and are not fitted with emission control systems , such as cataly@@ tic conver@@ ters .
mobility is essential for the functioning of modern societies .
it enables free movement of people , goods and services and offers possibilities for trade , living , leisure , learning and retail shopping .
a well @@@ -@@ @ developed transport system is the ambition of all societies .
however , a number of technology @@@ -@@ @ related factors determine how environmentally sustainable transport is in the SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
from a socioeconomic point of view , mobility patterns are becoming more unsustainable .
cong@@ estion makes urban areas less and less easily accessible , and leads to significant costs in terms of delivery delays and lost working hours .
at the same time , declining public transport restricts the mobility of those who do not have a personal car .
among the reasons for severe air quality problems in the major cities of EECCA countries are the age and engine technology of the vehicles .
as well as being a pollut@@ ant in its own right , the presence of lead in petrol inhib@@ its the functioning of cataly@@ tic conver@@ ters which help reduce other emissions .
hence , the ph@@ asing @@@ -@@ @ out of lead@@ ed petrol has been a priority in many SE@@ E and EECCA countries and has been achieved in many of them .
currently , lead@@ ed petrol has not been phased out in Bosnia and Herzegovina , F@@ Y@@ R of Macedonia , Montenegro and Serbia .
a ban on lead@@ ed petrol in Bosnia and Herzegovina is scheduled for 1 January 2010 ( PC@@ F@@ V , 2007 ) .
in EECCA Georgia , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have not yet phased out lead@@ ed petrol ( E@@ AP Task Force Secretariat , 2006 ; PC@@ V@@ F , 2007 ) .
in many countries of the SE@@ E region progress is being made to align fuel
vehicles of SE@@ E and EECCA : age and origins
in Armenia the car fleet is old : 30 % are more than 20 years old and over 70 % of the cars imported into the country are second @@@ -@@ @ hand .
in Kazakhstan most cars are second @@@ -@@ @ hand and imported from Germany , although cars are also imported from Japan and South Korea ( A@@ ben@@ ova , 2006 ; Dim@@ it@@ rov , 2004 ) .
in Georgia most vehicles are between 10 and 15 years old and imported second @@@ -@@ @ hand cars from Western Europe , although the proportion of Soviet @@@ -@@ @ made cars is still high ( Georgian Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources , 2006 ) .
car fle@@ ets are often old : in 2003 , 65 % of the passenger cars were over 16 years old in Montenegro ( RE@@ C , 2006 ) .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
the increasing number of mini@@ buses and private taxis , which are replacing larger , publicly @@@ -@@ @ operated buses , are adding to the cong@@ estion problems .
generally , however , there is as yet little cong@@ estion on inter@@ urban roads .
quality and emissions legislation with that of the EU , although progress is more advanced in some countries , particularly those that aim to acc@@ ede to the EU .
in many EECCA countries Russian fuel quality standards are used , and they are stricter than some of those previously applied in SE@@ E , but are not as stringent as those of the EU ( RE@@ C , 2006 ) .
in most countries petrol and diesel still dominate the transport market , but the use of alternative fuels is increasing in some countries ( see Box 7.@@ 6 ) .
reduced accessibility for those without access to private motor@@ ised transport
fuel smuggling and adul@@ ter@@ ation are quite common activities across Europe , and these can adversely affect fuel quality and vehicle emissions .
the scale of such activities varies enormously from one country to another according to circumstances , and by its very nature is difficult to quanti@@ fy .
the decline of public transport at the expense of private transport also reduces the potential mobility of those who previously relied on public transport and who do not have access to private cars .
poor maintenance of vehicles also contributes to air pollution .
in EECCA countries there is usually no systematic inspection of vehicles and authorities are often poorly equipped for measuring technical vehicle requirements and fuel quality .
where emission controls do exist , they are frequently based on outdated standards ( Dim@@ it@@ rov , 2004 ) , and the requirements are often not enforced rigor@@ ously .
for freight , similarly , rail and water transport tend to be more resource @@@ -@@ @ efficient than road transport .
7.3 Policy initiatives
the use of alternative fuels can contribute to improving local air quality through reducing emissions of certain pollutants .
in Armenia the use of CN@@ G increased by 230 % between 2001 and 2005 and now accounts for 24 % of the market .
this is due to the increased use of the fuel by mini@@ buses , buses and light @@@ -@@ @ duty trucks and has been stimulated by the fact that CN@@ G costs about one @@@ -@@ @ third of the price of petrol ( Ts@@ ar@@ uk@@ yan , 2006 ) .
in the context of efficiency and environmental impacts of transport , there is clearly a hierarchy of ' desirable ' kinds of transport .
the most energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient and affordable modes are , of course , walking and cycling as they entail virtually no use of fossil fuels or other non @@@ -@@ @ renewable resources , and are ,
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
transport in this respect , the most desirable means of transport for short journeys .
efficient passenger transport also implies land @@@ -@@ @ use patterns that minimise the need to travel long distances for goods , services , jobs and the use of public transport .
however , within each mode there is a considerable variation between the energy efficiency of different types of vehicles .
for example , large public transport vehicles tend to be more energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient per passenger kilometre than small individual vehicles , provided always that they are well utilis@@ ed .
electric trains usually are appreci@@ ably more fuel @@@ -@@ @ efficient than diesel trains , while diesel cars and trucks tend to be more efficient than petrol ones .
there is an enormous variation between vehicles according to size , age , and type of construction .

in Montenegro the national Sp@@ atial Plan for 2020 sets out strategic considerations on accessibility and travel generation , while the Transport Development Plan compl@@ ements the Sp@@ atial Plan and considers the more detailed issues .
transport plans include provisions on reducing cong@@ estion and encouraging public transport use for both passenger and freight travel .
elsewhere , e.g. in Tajikistan and Georgia , environmental issues are identified as priorities in national Poverty Reduction Strate@@ gies .
more recent strategic documents tend to make a more explicit reference to climate change issues , in addition to those of air quality .
in the SE@@ E countries the need for better urban and regional planning has been recognised in both Serbia and Macedonia ( UNECE , 200@@ 2@@ c and 200@@ 2@@ b ) .
in this context insufficient use is often made of strategic environmental assessment .
7.@@ 3.2 Investment in infrastructure and traffic management
many EECCA countries have also set up procedures or processes to improve the integration of environmental concerns into transport policies .
for example , in some countries , transport and environment issues are discussed in inter@@ ministerial working groups and the relevant ministries have regular contacts .
in around half of the EECCA countries transport ministry staff have received environmental training and there is a specialised unit in the transport ministry to deal with environmental issues ( E@@ AP Task Force Secretariat , 2006 ) .
there is recognition both by national governments and institutions that action is needed to develop the transport infrastructure of SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
as discussed above , however , larger international projects , particularly roads , often prove more attractive for potential investments than for more local infrastructure .
many countries are attempting to put more investment into local infrastructure , particularly in urban areas .
by no means do all of the SE@@ E and EECCA countries have a transport strategy . where these do exist , they tend to focus on infrastructure development rather than on other aspects of transport policies .
in Belarus expenditure on urban public transport has been significantly increased in recent years .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
example , the reform of economic instruments is identified as an area of environmental action in the Georgian Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy ( from 2000 ) .
the 1998 Armenian NE@@ AP and the Kazakh Environmental Protection Programme for 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 also both mention improving environmental management through the use of economic instruments ( E@@ AP Task Force Secretariat , 2006 ) .
the recognition of the need to determine prices in a fair manner is also a feature of the transport development strategy in Montenegro .
many countries are also beginning to recognise the importance of improved traffic management .
for many cities , e.g. Minsk , Belgrade and Sk@@ op@@ je , the first step is the diversion of through traffic to city ring roads in order to alleviate cong@@ estion problems in city centres .
in some cities , e.g. Tbilisi and Almaty , restrictions are placed on the use of main roads by freight traffic in order to alleviate cong@@ estion .
the import taxes for older vehicles were increased in 2005 . these represented an increase of 25 % on previous levels for cars that were more than 10 years old and a tre@@ bling of taxes for cars more than 14 years old .
the import tax rates on newer cars ( i.e. those less than 3 years old ) are higher than those on cars between three and ten years old in order to increase tax revenue .
in Macedonia custom duties of 10 % apply to new vehicles compared to a duty of 1@@ 3.3 % for second @@@ -@@ @ hand vehicles ( RE@@ C , 2006 ) .
in Georgia , on the other hand , the import tax on newer light duty vehicles is higher than that on older vehicles .
the annual vehicle tax is differentiated in the same way : it is based on age and engine capacity and it decreases for older vehicles ( Georgian Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources , 2006 ) .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
the use of economic instruments
Kazakhstan 's annual car taxation system has some positive elements from an environmental perspective .
the taxation level on older cars that are produced in the EECCA is even lower - for the same engine capacity - than the tax for older non @@@ -@@ @ EECCA produced cars .
other countries have been considering adopting higher taxes on cars that poll@@ ute more .
for example , Albania has considered increasing taxes for second @@@ -@@ @ hand cars .
in many SE@@ E countries EU vehicle emission and fuel quality standards are motivated by hopes of eventual accession to the EU .
7.@@ 3.4 Regulation
as noted above , lead@@ ed petrol has been phased out in many SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
where lead@@ ed petrol is still in use , there are plans to phase it out soon in the coming years .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
consequently , municipal authorities are faced with local transport problems caused by increased car use and a decline in the use of public transport .
in the absence of firm policy action , growing car traffic can literally crowd out public transport , while at the same time reducing demand for its services .
this can lead to a downward spiral in what were in most cases historically very good levels of public transport availability .
bans on older vehicles , or vehicles without certain technological features , have also been put in place .
in an effort to reduce emissions from cars , from 1 January 2007 , Armenia banned the import of cars without cataly@@ tic conver@@ ters .
laws are also being introduced to create air quality monitoring points and to introduce revised emission standards for vehicles . the intention is to introduce EU standards gradually ( Ts@@ ar@@ uk@@ yan , 2006 ) .
legislation is currently being developed in Montenegro to address the problems arising from the import and use of second @@@ -@@ @ hand vehicles , while in Macedonia and Serbia the import of second @@@ -@@ @ hand cars more than six years old is banned .
in many EECCA countries , e.g. in Kazakhstan , there are no restrictions on the import and use of older cars .
7.4 Con@@ clu@@ sions
given the diversity of countries covered in this report , it is difficult to gener@@ alise about transport solutions in the SE@@ E and EECCA regions .
many SE@@ E countries aspire to join the EU , while the economies of the Central Asian Repub@@ lics are still linked to other countries of the former Soviet Union .
however , it is possible to identify some common issues , barriers and opportunities that exist - at least to some extent - in most countries of the region .
7.@@ 4.1 Common issues
the policy decisions taken in response to these problems are often not implemented in an integrated manner and are undertaken by different institutions .
this investment in road infrastructure is further boosting car use to the detriment of the softer transport modes - walking and cycling - and of urban green spaces ( Dim@@ it@@ rov , 2004 ) .
worsening air pollution , particularly in urban areas , is exacerbated by an old vehicle stock , poorly maintained vehicles and poor testing systems .
in addition , poor enforcement , e.g. with respect to fuel quality and the road@@ worthiness of vehicles , makes the problem worse .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
at strategic level , a real vision of a future transport system in which both demand and supply considerations are taken into account is often lacking .
in delivering freight services , private operators can often offer a more flexible and cheaper service than traditional rail trans@@ porters .
on average , mobility in SE@@ E and EECCA countries is not yet anywhere near that of Western Europe .
in EECCA countries the proportion of travel undertaken on public transport is still relatively high , although the use of private road transport is increasing .
however , for this to happen , institutional capacity needs to be increased and policy frameworks need to be developed .
while there is recognition of the problems of the supply side of transport , and measures are being taken to address this wherever possible , less attention is still being paid to the demand side .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
transport wider environmental and health considerations into account ( e.g. EC@@ MT , 2005 ) .
the importance of public support for policies , especially those aimed at managing transport demand , should not be overlooked .
the awareness of the public , in relation to the links between transport , the environment and health , also needs to be increased through better communication of the issues and the potential solutions .
this will help build public support for the necessary measures to improve air quality ( e.g. Ko@@ k and de K@@ oning , 2003 ) .
this requires air quality monitoring networks to be adequately financed .
maxim@@ ising the potential for public transport
where such transport strategies do not exist , they should be developed to ensure that new problems , e.g. climate change , are integrated into transport policies .
public transport receives significantly less investment than it did in the centrally @@@ -@@ @ planned economies of the 1980s .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
finally , in order to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account in the construction of infrastructures , wider , better and more consistent use of environmental impact assessments is essential .
annual road taxes could also be differentiated to encourage the purchase and use of such vehicles .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
where vehicles fail such tests , it is fundamentally important that the required remedi@@ al action be undertaken or the vehicle have its licence withdrawn ( e.g. Ko@@ k and de K@@ oning , 2003 ) .
once operational , inspection standards could be tightened so that the average performance of the vehicle fleet continues to improve over time .
finally , the quality of the fuel used in the transport sector is also extremely important to the environmental performance of the vehicle fleet .

facts and figures
total waste generation per capita in EECCA countries is high compared with other regions in the world .
it is estimated at 14 tonnes per year compared with 4 tonnes in the EU .
per capita waste generation in 2004 ranged from 2@@ 85 kg in Azerbaijan to over 18 tonnes in the Russian Federation .
a substantial part of waste generated in the EECCA countries is hazardous .
between 400 and 500 million tonnes of hazardous waste are generated in the EECCA countries every year , con@@ stituting 12 @@@ -@@ @ 18 % of total waste generation .
limited progress has been achieved in recent years in reuse or recovery of resources in municipal waste .
the situation is somewhat better for industrial waste .
almost none of the land@@ fills operated in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries have an installation for land@@ fill gas collection .
methane collection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and has a considerable value under the Kyoto protocol .
the economic returns generated could offset investments in methane collection and finance additional improvements in land@@ fill operations or other waste management initiatives .
in many cases municipal waste management systems have to undergo major modifications .
lessons could be learned from the experiences in the EU concerning more SC@@ P @@@ -@@ @ oriented waste management .
waste is generated by almost all economic activities : extraction of resources , production and manufacturing activities , distribution and transport , consumption or even management of the waste itself .
waste has many impacts on the environment , including pollution of air , surface water bodies and groundwater .
moreover , valuable space is taken up by land@@ fills and poor waste management causes risks to public health .
waste generation and disposal represent a loss of natural resources .
reducing the amounts of waste generated across all economic activities , including production and consumption phases requires a holistic approach for which SC@@ P is particularly suitable .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
describing past trends and the present situation with respect to the generation and management of waste in the EECCA and SE@@ E regions .
the Soviet Union generated large amounts of waste but failed to manage them in an appropriate manner .
significant amounts of radioactive waste , chemical weapons , toxic missile fuel and other hazardous waste were stored in mines and at industrial and military facilities .
secondly , the rates of car ownership , and consequently the number of end @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life waste vehicles , were also much lower .
in general , information is presented at regional level , supplemented by more detailed examples at country level .
these studies were carried out during the second half of 2006 .
radioactive waste is not dealt with in the chapter since its analysis demands a completely different approach .
due to the economic recession and increasing decentr@@ alisation , most municipal waste management equipment has not been replaced since the early 1990s .
the development of waste management strategies and regulations , and the progress made in municipal waste planning have all been slow .
waste was not - and is still not - regarded as a significant threat to the environment and human health , nor is it perceived as a potential source of valuable resources .

poorly operated or abandoned mining sites and associated processing activities ( e.g. heavy metals and cy@@ an@@ ide ) have caused severe water pollution ( UNEP , 200@@ 6@@ c ) .
a growth in migration from rural to urban areas is expected to lead to the increased generation of municipal waste in large cities .
specific waste management and hazardous waste plans have yet to be approved in most countries .
the level of environmental awareness concerning waste among citizens of the SE@@ E countries is considered very low ( RE@@ C , 2003 ; UNEP , 200@@ 6@@ c ) .
the remainder of this section reviews past trends and the current situation using available statistics and information from the last ten years .
however , as mentioned earlier , the availability of data on waste generation and management in the EECCA and the SE@@ E countries is limited , and coverage was especially poor during the 1990s .
due to poor data availability it was difficult to estimate total waste generation in the SE@@ E countries , especially during the 1990s .
in Croatia total waste generation increased from about 4 million tonnes in the late 1990s to 10.@@ 6 million tonnes in 2004 .
the high share of the mining and metallurgy sectors in total waste generation is illustrated in Table 8.1 , which presents waste generation by sector in the Russian Federation in 2004 .
total waste generation per capita in EECCA is 14 tonnes per year , which is relatively high compared with other regions in the world ( e.g. 4 tonnes in the EU ) .
there are large differences in waste generation between individual EECCA countries . per capita

coal mining and waste generation
in Ukraine coal extraction and metallurgy account for about 90 % of total waste generation .
extraction of coal , the largest single source of waste , generates almost as much solid waste as the amount of the extracted coal .
in addition to solid waste , coal extraction generates large amounts of gases and wastewater .

hazardous waste contains substances which , even in small quantities , can be irrit@@ ant , toxic , inflamm@@ able or otherwise harmful .
so , proper collection and handling of hazardous waste is crucial for protecting the environment and public health .
generation of hazardous waste usually divide wastes into four , sometimes five , hazard classes , where hazardous class V waste is considered to be ' practically ' non @@@ -@@ @ hazardous .
most hazardous class IV and some hazardous class III wastes in EECCA would be considered non @@@ -@@ @ hazardous in the EU and OECD Member States .
between 400 and 500 million tonnes of hazardous waste are generated in the EECCA countries every year , con@@ stituting between 12 % and 18 % of total .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 25 , by comparison , hazardous waste accounts for approximately 3 % of total waste generation .
most EECCA countries use a waste classification system based on the former Soviet system dating back to the early 1990s .
the classification of waste is based on the hazardous nature of the compounds and the content of the dangerous substances .

the low i@@ gu@@ res for Croatia result from the fact that many companies do not report data .
a rough estimation is that in total 200 000 tonnes hazardous waste are generated per year ( Croatia , 2007 ) . in 2005 the ig@@ ure for F@@ Y@@ R of Maced@@ o nia was 4.@@ 63 million tonnes .

ensuring proper management of hazardous waste remains a big challenge for the EECCA countries and only a small proportion of it is recycled or treated properly .
it is estimated that in Kazakhstan 6.7 billion tonnes of hazardous waste has already been accumulated , and the quantities continue to grow ( Kazakhstan ME@@ P , 200@@ 6@@ b ) .
evidence suggests recycling and recovery of hazardous waste started to increase after 2000 .
in the Russian Federation and Ukraine , the countries with the largest generation of hazardous waste , between 30 % and 50 % of hazardous waste is now reported as recovered or recycled .
• lack of sufficient and reliable information on
by 2006 , there was no sign of improvement in hazardous waste treatment facilities ( RE@@ C , 2006 ) .
however , some progress had been made in developing strategies and legislation on hazardous waste .
as with the EECCA countries , some of this progress could be seen as a consequence of international obligations under the Basel and Stockholm Conventions .
for example , F@@ Y@@ R of Macedonia submitted an implementation plan of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants , while Albania implemented the amendments of the Basel Convention .

seasonal changes in waste composition in Donetsk
more detailed studies have been made on the composition of household waste in the city of Donetsk in Ukraine , which has a population of approx . 1.5 million .
figure 8.@@ 8 shows how the composition of household waste varies with the season .
the share of food waste is higher during the summer and autumn seasons than during the rest of the year due to the consumption of more vegetables at this time of year .
the high share of resi@@ du@@ als in the w@@ inter@@ time may be due to resi@@ dues of heating , such as ash from the burning of coal .
these seasonal changes in waste composition might determine how large a capacity is necessary in the waste management system to deal with the different waste streams .

land@@ fill is by far the most common ( between 90 % and 100 % ) method of disposal of municipal waste in EECCA and SE@@ E countries .
however , almost all land@@ fills in the region are outdated and do not conform to modern standards .
inspections have shown that 92 % of approved municipal waste land@@ fills do not meet sanitary norms ( UNEP , 200@@ 6@@ a ) .
collection and management of land@@ fill gases , which also contain the potent greenhouse gas methane , is rare , leading to a high risk of fires and explosions .
moreover , the growth in municipal waste generation is expected to cause a substantial rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years because of the significant share of organic matter in municipal waste .
finally , le@@ ach@@ ate is generally not collected nor treated , posing a constant risk of pollution of soil and water sources , including drinking water .
in some countries new legislation has been introduced which requires permits for land@@ filling of municipal solid waste .
however , older land@@ fills , established in the Soviet time , are normally exempt from environmental permits .
this is , for example , the case in Georgia ( Ant@@ adze and Gu@@ g@@ ush@@ vili , 2006 ) .
nevertheless , the following three cases illustrate exceptions to the general picture ( Bo@@ xes 8.4 , 8.5 and 8.6 ) .
the insufficient recycling of municipal waste should be seen primarily as the result of the low
municipal waste management in Moscow , and pot@@ ent@@ i al for recycling and reuse
in Moscow 27 % of municipal waste is re@@ processed or recycled .
Moscow City Hall has issued regulations designed to increase recycling levels of municipal waste to 40 % .
in the Russian Federation the annual generation of packaging waste per capita is 50 kg , while in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 the average figure is about 175 kg .
certain types of packaging waste in Moscow already have quite high recycling rates , for example , a 90 % rate of recycling for aluminium packaging waste .
on the other hand , recycling of plastic waste packaging is low , at about 5 % .
it is worth noting that reuse systems are not usually counted as part of a recycling system .
by contrast , in the EU and especially in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , much of the glass packaging waste is one @@@ -@@ @ way packaging which goes into a melting process and thus contributes to a high recycling rate ( Gon@@ opol@@ sky , 2006 ) .
when comparing recycling rates it is therefore important to know whether a country with a low recycling rate has a high reuse rate .

introduction of a successful packaging policy in Croatia
about 1.7 billion beverage units are sold each year in Croatia , with an ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing part of the containers made of aluminium and PE@@ T .
in January 2006 , the Croatian Government introduced an Or@@ din@@ ance on Pack@@ aging and Pack@@ aging W@@ aste as a means of implementing the EU Pack@@ aging Directive .
the Or@@ din@@ ance came after an amendment to the W@@ aste Act was passed in 2004 , and a waste strategy was prepared in 2005 .
the policy instruments used included introduction of the full @@@ -@@ @ cost recovery mechanism for waste beverage containers .
the fee covers the expenses for managing the packaging waste , including collection , storage and transportation to the recovery location .
II ) A re@@ turn@@ able fee ( deposit ) is collected to encourage final consumers to return the empty packaging ( EUR 0.@@ 07 / unit ) .
this fee has a temporary character for the producer since it is reimbur@@ sed following the sale of the product .
III ) A ' stimulating ' fee which should encourage the producers to use re@@ usable packaging .
this fee is paid by those producers who have not reached national targets for the use of re@@ turn@@ able packaging .
in 2006 the target rate for use of re@@ turn@@ able packaging was 10 % for all kinds of beverages , except for beer where the target was 65 % .
the target was scheduled to increase progressively over the coming years and reach 60 % for all beverages in 2013 , except for beer where the target is 90 % .
this included 14 000 tonnes of PE@@ T , 57 000 tonnes of glass and 1 400 tonnes of aluminium and steel .
by way of comparison , in 2005 the amounts collected were 2 000 tonnes of PE@@ T and 14 000 tonnes of glass .
in addition , around 1 500 new jobs have been created to ensure the collection , storage , transportation and recycling of packaging waste .
in October 2006 , the Directorate for Environmental Protection of Serbia proposed to introduce the same deposit @@@ -@@ @ refund system .
roof ‑ tiles in Ukraine made from plastic waste
'@@ When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s , many heavy industries in Ukraine closed down , resulting in increasing unemployment and poverty .
housing was a particular problem , with many existing houses roof@@ ed with crumbling sheets of as@@ best@@ os .
since then the transition to a market economy has increased incomes and fu@@ elled demand for new and better housing .

comparison of the current waste situation in Bel@@ g rade , Bishkek , Dnipropetrovsk and
as demonstrated by Table 8.7 and Table 8.@@ 8 and other information from the city studies , waste management in the four cities shares some common characteristics :
with the exception of Tbilisi , generation of municipal waste per capita increased in the last five to seven years , especially in Belgrade and Bishkek .
the declining figures for Tbilisi are likely to be the result of incorrect reporting , since the number of inhabitants remained almost unchanged during this period .
none of the four cities implemented separate collection of hazardous waste .
all cities aside from Dnipropetrovsk have increased the number of waste b@@ ins and containers in the collection area during the last five to seven years .
the situation differs concerning the number and quality of collection trucks , but in general it seems that the quality of the service has improved .
in Belgrade two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of all trucks are more than 12 years old , but all have a comp@@ acting facility .
additional new trucks have been acquired in recent years .
in Tbilisi , a large part of the collection fleet was renewed in 2006 and the new trucks have comp@@ actor units .
by contrast , in Bishkek no trucks have comp@@ actors and the number of collection vehicles declined between 2002 and 2005 .
in three of the cities all municipal waste is usually sent to land@@ fills .
Dnipropetrovsk has an incin@@ eration plant , where one @@@ -@@ @ third of municipal waste is treated .
very limited amounts of recy@@ cl@@ ables are separated , normally by waste sc@@ av@@ engers .
it is estimated that the amount of separated waste is below 1 % of the land@@ filled quantities .
the composition of waste in the four cities shows a large potential for sorting out recy@@ cl@@ able materials , especially organic waste , paper and cardboard , but also plastics , textiles and metals .
in Tbilisi , plastic is now a more significant waste component , reflecting the fact that plastic has become the predominant packaging for beverages .
none of the existing land@@ fills lives up to modern standards and at the moment none is equipped with a land@@ fill gas collection system .
however , methane collection is now planned for land@@ fills in Bishkek , Dni@@ propet@@ ovsk and Tbilisi , financed through the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol .
ensuring funding for collection , recycling and disposal of municipal waste is a major problem in Bishkek , and it appears that the market for providing waste collection and disposal services is not economically attractive .
Belgrade has received substantial foreign donations ( e.g. new trucks and machines ) , and there are some indications that the public utility company will be reformed and partly privati@@ sed .
in Tbilisi , significant municipal investments have been made in the last few years to improve waste management infrastructure .
however , the currently used tariffs are based on old Soviet calculation methods and need to be revised to reflect the changes in service costs .
no information is available about tariffs and investments in Dnipropetrovsk , but at national level expenditure on waste management has increased considerably over the last two years .

sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
in 2005 the government adopted a package of programmes on waste management including the state programme on waste management to implement the law ' On Industrial and Resid@@ ential W@@ astes ' .
initiatives concerning Bishkek 's municipal waste strategy are still only at the planning stage .
in Dnipropetrovsk , a strategy and programme for municipal waste was passed in December 2006 .
covering the period 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2011 , the strategy aims to support comprehensive waste collection , including sorting and recycling of waste as well as increasing the standards for land@@ fills .
both collection of waste and the disposal activities have been out@@ sourced , and significant investments made in new equipment such as waste b@@ ins and waste collection trucks .
in the case of Dnipropetrovsk strong action was taken by NGOs and the political and administrative sector to develop a municipal waste strategy for 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2011 .
the initiatives taken were in line with the national strategic waste management programme , even though only a few decisions have been made until now to implement national principles at municipal level .
low public interest in environmental issues even though , in the case of waste , economic and environmental interests often conver@@ ge for the public .
in Tbilisi , the municipal authorities have given priority to waste management issues in recent years due to the critical sanitary situation in the city .
in 2006 , the city doubled the total budget for waste management to improve waste collection .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
this mostly concerns local and state institutions , such as ministries and municipalities .
the involvement of stakeholders in decision @@@ -@@ @ making processes and in drafting laws and strategies is very low .
despite the fact that regulations include general provisions for municipal waste management , there is still a lack of well @@@ -@@ @ developed organisational structure and funding for their enforcement .
moreover , no economic incentives are used in municipal waste management .
however , a municipal programme was approved in 2006 in Bishkek to implement the law on production and consumption of waste .
the Draft General Lay@@ out of Bishkek Plan seeks to establish waste recycling stations in each district , thus helping to reduce the amounts of waste going to land@@ fills and to increase waste recycling .
moreover , the introduction of economic incentives will promote waste recycling and separation in homes .
strategic programmes on waste management have been adopted at national level , but little action has been taken to enforce them at municipal level .
the legislation and municipal programmes lack initiatives to promote future activities .
in mid @@@ -@@ @ 2006 a joint initiative to develop a complex programme called ' Be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our with W@@ aste in the City of Dnipropetrovsk for 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2011 ' was launched .
the Programme is trying to create conditions that support comprehensive waste collection , transport , sorting , recycling , utilis@@ ation , and land@@ fills .
in recent years municipal waste management has been placed high up on the agenda of the Tbilisi municipal authorities .
the examples of Dnipropetrovsk and Tbilisi , which put waste management issues high on their municipal agenda , could give positive signals and inspiration to other countries .
bench@@ marking could be initiated among cities , especially where the systems for waste management are similar .

8.4 Opportun@@ ities for improving waste management
all EECCA and SE@@ E countries except Tajikistan are party to the Basel Convention .
overview of similarities and differences in waste management
all EECCA and SE@@ E countries currently face problems with proper collection , treatment and disposal of waste .
some EECCA and SE@@ E countries have in recent years made improvements in collecting data on generation and treatment of waste .
contrary to the situation in the EU , regulations and legal requirements have not resulted in significant improvements in waste management in the SE@@ E and EECCA regions .
several countries have in recent years initiated activities to implement EU standards for waste facilities ( e.g. Croatia and Ukraine ) .
in addition to formulating framework waste strategies , several countries are now developing more detailed action plans and legislation for waste .
while some progress has been made in addressing hazardous and radioactive waste and certain industrial wastes , there has been no significant improvement in the municipal waste sector over the last 10 @@@ -@@ @ 15 years .
most municipal waste is disposed of in land@@ fills which do not meet even the lowest environmental standards .
some countries have been subject to attempts to ship hazardous waste illegally .
the development of waste strategies and legislation , and their implementation have mainly progressed in those areas where countries have international obligations or responsibilities , for example , the Basel and Stockholm Conventions .
much of this work was carried out through donor @@@ -@@ @ funded programs .
a few countries have successfully introduced deposits on one @@@ -@@ @ way packaging .
today , recycling is mainly driven by economic incentives , and therefore has focused on industrial waste and not on municipal waste , where recycling and recovery is more complicated .
at the same time , some existing recycling facilities face a shortage of recy@@ cl@@ able waste necessary for their operation .
in general , there is a lack of data ( and lack of related data collection systems ) on generation and treatment of waste , including municipal waste .
while reuse of bottles still exists in many EECCA countries , single @@@ -@@ @ use disposable packaging is increasingly taking over .
development and implementation of waste strategies and action plans still seem to depend largely on external assistance .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
• improving collection of data and information about the amounts and composition of waste ;
vast amounts of waste in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries are generated in resource mining and processing activities .
when a country succeeds in combining economic incentives with legislative requirements , it is possible to manage effectively certain types of waste .
the success of a packaging policy in Croatia is a good example of how a political goal , combined with the introduction of a deposit @@@ -@@ @ refund system , can achieve excellent results .
functioning systems for reuse of packaging were in place in the former Soviet Union .
experience has shown that even if framework waste strategies are not yet in place , certain necessary elements have already been developed and various initiatives taken to improve waste management .
in many municipalities in EECCA and SE@@ E countries , only limited or minimal investments in waste management were made in the 1990s . the systems to collect waste need to be modern@@ ised , including waste b@@ ins and collection trucks .
recently , investments in new equipment have been made , for example , in Dnipropetrovsk ( Ukraine ) , Tashkent ( Uzbekistan ) ( EEA , 2007 ) and Tbilisi ( Georgia ) .
some progress has been made in waste data collection , notably in Belarus , Croatia , the Russian Federation and Ukraine .
municipal waste in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries includes significant quantities of paper , cardboard and PE@@ T plastics .
hazardous waste strategies and chemical protection plans have already been developed or are being developed in many of the countries as a result of obligations under international treaties .
while such strategies are often developed with the assistance of international organizations or donor programs , some examples presented in this chapter show that it is possible to initiate waste strategy development regardless of the source of financing .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
environmental technologies . much bio@@ degrad@@ able waste was land@@ filled in the past ( Note : this situation is expected to continue in the near future ) , and the potential for collecting methane from land@@ fills is there .
in Bishkek ( Kyrgyzstan ) and in Yerevan ( Armenia ) methane gas collection projects have already been approved ( EEA , 2007 ) .
in Dnipropetrovsk ( Ukraine ) and Tbilisi ( Georgia ) collection of methane is planned .
methane collection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and has a considerable value under the Kyoto protocol .
the economic returns generated could offset investments in methane collection and finance additional improvements in land@@ fill operations or other waste management initiatives .
municipal waste in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries contains much organic and food waste .
organic waste - options for more sustainable man@@ a gement of municipal waste
available policy options include prevention of the organic waste and utilis@@ ation of those resources in the municipal waste .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
however , there are also opportunities to draw from country experience to avoid common problems .
as was shown by the experience of Tbilisi where collection and disposal of waste were coordinated in one unit .
benefits can also be gained from regional cooperation .
a recent UNEP report recommended creating ' ... a single regional scheme of waste management for Central Asia Countries ' ( UNEP , 200@@ 6@@ b ) .
8.5 Con@@ clu@@ sions
the challenges of introducing effective and sustainable waste management in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries are enormous .
available information shows that little improvement has been achieved in waste management over the last five to seven years :
initially , the policy goal at the EU was to ensure proper collection of mixed waste and to assure safe land@@ filling .
the approach was subsequently adjusted to separate recy@@ cl@@ able waste fr@@ actions from the mixed waste ; firstly , to increase recycling or resource recovery from wastes , and then to limit land@@ filling to non @@@ -@@ @ recy@@ cl@@ able wastes only .
the EECCA and SE@@ E countries could draw on this experience , gaining both environmental and economic benefits in the process .
• generation of all types of wastes , including hazardous waste , is increasing ;
proper collection systems of waste are lacking and there is no separate collection of municipal hazardous waste ;
short term recommendations ( 1 @@@ -@@ @ 5 years )
however , since 2005 several countries have begun to develop new waste strategies ;
• price mechanisms used in waste management are still not effective in creating incentives for waste prevention .
improving coordination and cooperation between the different authorities dealing with waste at national , regional and municipal level .
this should include more clear division of tasks and allocation of responsibilities to avoid over@@ laps ;
however , there are also some positive signs .
concerning municipal waste , some improvements began emerging in 2006 , especially at municipal as well as , in some cases , provincial level .
general improvements at national and city levels will require a step @@@ -@@ @ wise approach and a long @@@ -@@ @ term horizon .
individual countries in the EECCA and SE@@ E regions have very different starting points

• implementing more advanced recycling schemes and technologies for certain waste types , such as electrical and electronic waste ; and
- ensuring that new and existing inc@@ iner@@ ators comply with high technical standards , such as those used in the European Union .
regardless of whether the activities are to be implemented in the short or medium term , it is necessary to start planning their implementation today .
• putting in place economic and legislative incentives to encourage reuse and recycling .

9 Way forward
impact of socioeconomic changes on SC@@ P policies
most EECCA and SE@@ E economies have been experiencing rapid economic growth since the beginning of the decade , following the economic decline of the 1990s .
in a number of countries GDP now exceeds pre @@@ -@@ @ transition levels .
the key forces which have shaped those economies since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s are economic transformation , privatisation , foreign investment , and increasing globalisation .
average household consumption per capita , in purchasing power parity , has now exceeded 1990 levels in all sub @@@ -@@ @ regions except Central Asia .
levels of consumption in EECCA and SE@@ E countries , while growing rapidly , remain significantly lower than in Western Europe .
however , energy intensi@@ ties ( i.e. energy consumption per unit output ) of industry , transport , community services and buildings , in particular in EECCA countries , are generally much higher .
countries also experience more loc@@ alised environmental problems such as inappropriate management and regulation of waste , industry , urban transport and agricultural development .
the common challenge for all countries is to break the link between economic growth and environmental impacts from production and consumption , resource use and waste generation .
looking to the future , environmental pressures may grow with increasing wealth .
rapid changes in lifestyle , particularly in urban areas , are already noticeable .
this can be seen in increasing ownership of private cars , the growing quantity and variety of available imported goods , and in the increasing quantities of waste generated .
at the same time public services , including public transport , district heating and waste and recycling systems established under a central planning system , have significantly deteriorated and declined .
in contrast , in much of SE@@ E and EECCA there is a clear need to address social sustainability issues .
the benefits of economic growth have not been distributed evenly across society , and the gap between rich and poor is growing .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
imports and exports of food to and from EECCA and SE@@ E countries are also increasing rapidly , and that leads to growing pressures from the transport of food .
this is partly explained by cold clim@@ ates , but other important causes include widespread but inefficient district heating , inefficient distribution systems , and the low thermal efficiency of buildings .
even though economic and environmental benefits from improved eco @@@ -@@ @ efficiency in industry are substantial , such initiatives have not been undertaken consistently .
there are emerging signs that decou@@ pling between industrial output and pollution and resource use has taken place in some areas , but the efficiency of use resources and energy is still low in most EECCA and SE@@ E countries .
moreover , this growth is largely based on pollution @@@ -@@ @ intensive , resource @@@ -@@ @ extracting and processing industries .
proper treatment of waste remains a problem , especially for municipal and hazardous wastes .
furthermore , given the current construction boom in some countries , quantities of construction and demol@@ ition waste will increase .
end @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life ( obsolete ) vehicles , waste electronics , household appliances and packaging waste are also set to increase .
current car ownership levels remain relatively low but are increasing rapidly in a number of countries , particularly in urban areas .
traffic cong@@ estion is on the increase in urban areas , leading to health , environmental and social problems .
at the same time , public transport , which is potentially more sustainable , is in decline , partly due to dil@@ ap@@ id@@ ated infrastructure and partly due to the withdrawal of subsidies .
the dramatic changes in agricultural management and ownership , and increased exposure to global competition , caused a sharp reduction in food production during the early to mid 1990s .
sustainable consumption and production in Southeast Europe and Eastern Europe , Caucasus and Central Asia
way forward eliminate losses and in@@ efficiencies and could be fed by combined heat and power or waste heat from industry ;
remaining challenges there is a well established tradition of using public transport .
it is also essential to improve institutional capacity to achieve more sustainable production and consumption .
in some countries , where environmental legislation is being tightened and enforcement is getting stricter , improvements in industry have already occurred .
