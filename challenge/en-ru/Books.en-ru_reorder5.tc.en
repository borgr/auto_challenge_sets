'Let me see what was it ? ' he thought , trying to recall his dream .
there were many other delightful things which I can 't just get hold of - can 't catch now I 'm awake . '
'Oh dear , dear , dear ! ' he groaned recalling what had happened .
and the details of his quarrel with his wife , his inextricable position , and , worst of all , his guilt , rose up in his imagination .
he could no longer find forgetfulness in sleep , at any rate not before night , could not go back to the music and the songs of the little decanter @-@ women , consequently he must seek forgetfulness in the dream of life .
the bell was answered immediately by his old friend and valet , Matthew , who brought in his clothes , boots , and a telegram .
'Any papers from the Office ? ' asked Oblonsky , as he took the telegram and sat down before the looking @-@ glass .
'They 're on your table , ' answered Matthew with a questioning and sympathizing glance at his master - adding after a pause with a sly smile : ' some one has called from the jobmaster 's . '
Oblonsky did not answer , but glanced at Matthew 's face in the looking @-@ glass . from their looks , as they met in the glass , it was evident that they understood one another .
he tore open the telegram and read it , guessing at the words , which ( as so often happens in telegrams ) were misspelt , and his face brightened .
'Matthew , my sister Anna Arkadyevna is coming to @-@ morrow , ' he said , motioning away for a moment the shiny plump hand of the barber , which was shaving a rosy path between his long curly whiskers .
'It 's me , sir , ' answered a firm and pleasant woman 's voice , and Matrena Filimonovna , the children 's nurse thrust her stern pockmarked face in at the door .
she suffers dreadfully ; it 's pitiful to see her , and everything in the house is topsy @-@ turvy .
Matthew blew some invisible speck off the shirt which he held ready gathered up like a horse 's collar , and with evident pleasure invested with it his master 's carefully tended body .
then he heard the sound of two childish voices outside the door , and recognized them as the voices of his eldest daughter , Tanya , and of his little boy Grisha .
'How 's Mama ? ' he asked , passing his hand over his daughter 's smooth delicate little neck , as he smilingly said ' Good morning ' in answer to the little boy 's greeting .
he was conscious of not caring as much for the boy as for the girl but did his best to treat them both alike . the boy felt this and did not respond to his father 's cold smile .
'i don 't know , ' she said . ' she said we were not to have any lessons , but must walk with Miss Hull to Grandmamma 's . '
'the carriage is ready , ' said Matthew , ' and there is a woman on business waiting for you . '
'But I must give you time to finish your coffee , ' answered Matthew in his friendly rude tone , with which it was impossible to be angry .
she pressed her lips together and a cheek @-@ muscle twitched on the right side of her pale nervous face .
she wished to go away , but staggered and held on to the back of a chair to support herself .
'But what 's to be done ? - what 's to be done ? ' said he , in a piteous voice , hardly knowing what he was saying , and sinking his head lower and lower .
to me you are detestable , disgusting - a stranger , yes , a perfect stranger ! ' she uttered that word stranger , so terrible to herself , with anguish and hatred .
she seemed to be trying to recollect herself , as if she did not know where she was or what she had to do . then she rose quickly and moved toward the door .
I am going away to @-@ day , and you may live here with your mistress ! '
for a few seconds Oblonsky stood alone ; then he wiped his eyes , sighed , and expanding his chest went out of the room .
'Enough or not , we shall have to manage , that 's clear , ' said Matthew , closing the carriage door and stepping back into the porch .
having arrived at his destination , Oblonsky ; respectfully followed by the door @-@ keeper bearing his portfolio , entered his little private room , put on his uniform , and came out into the Office .
you know it is very , very important for me to have a talk with you , ' said Levin .
Oblonsky , who had long known that Levin was in love with his , Oblonsky 's , sister @-@ in @-@ law Kitty , smiled very slightly and his eyes sparkled merrily .
in his student days he very nearly fell in love with the eldest daughter , Dolly ; but a marriage was soon after arranged between her and Oblonsky .
moreover , his former relation to Kitty had been that of a grown @-@ up man towards a child whose brother 's friend he was , and this seemed an additional obstacle in love 's path .
the question was the fashionable one , whether a definite line exists between psychological and physiological phenomena in human activity ; and if so , where it lies ?
when Levin entered , Sergius Ivanich greeted him with the coldly affable smile he bestowed on everybody and , having introduced him to the professor , went on with the discussion .
the small spectacled man with the narrow forehead interrupted the conversation a moment to say , ' how do you do ' to Levin and , paying no further attention to him , went on talking .
Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go , but soon became interested in the subject of their conversation .
the most fundamental perception - that of existence - is not received through the senses , for there is no special organ to convey that perception . '
but here again it seemed to Levin that having reached the most important matter they avoided it ; and he made up his mind to ask the professor a question .
'Incapable ! ' said Koznyshev . ' no , you don 't look at it from the right point of view . '
Levin read the note , written in a curious but familiar hand : ' I humbly beg you to leave me alone .
when Levin had read the note , holding it in his hand , he remained standing in front of Koznyshev without lifting his head .
a struggle was going on within him between the desire to forget his unfortunate brother for the present , and the consciousness that this would be wrong .
having got the address from Koznyshev 's footman Levin thought of going at once to see his brother ; but , on reflection , decided to put off the visit till the evening .
on that day of the week and at that hour , people belonging to the same set and acquainted with one another , met on the ice .
yet skaters appeared quite calmly to gain on her , to catch her up , and even speak to her , and quite independently of her to amuse themselves enjoying the excellent ice and the fine weather .
Nicholas Shcherbatsky , Kitty 's cousin , in a short jacket , tight trousers , with skates on his feet , was sitting on a bench , and seeing Levin , called out to him .
having turned the corner , she pushed off with an elastic little foot , glided straight up to Shcherbatsky , and catching hold of him with her hand , nodded smilingly to Levin .
there is a tradition here that you are the best skater , ' she said , flicking off with a small black @-@ gloved hand some hoar @-@ frost crystals that had fallen on her muff .
'i 'll go and put them on at once , ' he said , and went to hire some skates .
help me , O Lord ! ' thought Levin , hastening toward the old Frenchwoman with the grey curls ; who sat on one of the benches .
he had not the faintest recollection of it , but she was fond of the joke and had laughed at it for the last ten years .
he then flew down the slope and glided along the ice without so much as changing the easy position of his arms .
he caught his foot on the last step , but , scarcely touching the ice with his hand , made a violent effort , regained his balance , and skated away laughing .
when he saw Kitty who was going away , and her mother who had met her on the steps , Levin , flushed with the violent exercise , stood still and considered .
he then took off his skates and overtook mother and daughter at the gates of the Gardens .
Oblonsky crumpled his starched napkin and pushed a corner of it inside his waistcoat , then , with his arms comfortably on the table , attacked the oysters .
'i can 't help it , ' replied Levin . ' put yourself in my place - look at it from a country fellow 's point of view !
but here people purposely let their nails grow until they begin to curl , and have little saucers for studs to make it quite impossible for them to use their hands ! '
the Shcherbatskys asked me again and again , just as if I ought to know all about you .
'no , not behind me , but you have the future and I have the present ; and even that only half @-@ and @-@ half ! '
'There is nothing I should like better , ' said he , ' nothing !
'Wait a bit : you must take some sauce , ' said Oblonsky , stopping Levin 's hand that was pushing away the sauce @-@ boat .
at these words a sudden smile brightened Levin 's face , the kind of smile that is not far from tears of tenderness .
'ah , but all the same , ' said Levin , ' looking back at my life , I tremble and curse and bitterly regret ...
as I have got to know him now , he turns out to be both educated and very clever - a man who will go far . '
'Excuse me , but really I ... it 's quite incomprehensible to me . it 's as if ... just as incomprehensible as if I , after eating my fill here , went into a baker 's shop and stole a roll . '
'It 's all very well for you to talk like that - it 's like that gentleman in Dickens , who with his left hand threw all difficult questions over his right shoulder .
a man hardly has time to turn round , before he feels that he can no longer love his wife in that way , whatever his regard for her may be .
Oblonsky had more than once experienced this kind of acute estrangement instead of union following a dinner with a friend , and knew what to do in such a case .
'the bill ! ' he shouted and went out into the dining @-@ hall , where he immediately saw an aide @-@ de @-@ camp of his acquaintance , and entered into conversation with him about an actress and her protector .
and immediately in conversation with the aide @-@ de @-@ camp Oblonsky felt relief and rest after the talk with Levin , who always demanded of him too great a mental and spiritual strain .
Vronsky was openly attentive to Kitty when they met at balls , danced with her , and came to the house , so there could be no doubt as to the seriousness of his intentions .
at least so it seemed to the Princess . but in her daughters ' case she experienced how far from easy and simple the apparently easy business of marrying off a daughter really was .
the Princess had grown used to this in respect to her older daughters , but now she felt that her husband 's punctiliousness had more justification .
the French way , of parents deciding a daughter 's fate , was not accepted , and was even condemned .
the English way , of giving a girl perfect freedom , was also rejected , and would have been impossible in Russian Society .
that is why the Princess was more anxious about Kitty than she had been about her elder daughters .
she saw that Kitty was in love with him , but consoled herself with the thought that Vronsky was an honest man and therefore would not act in such a way .
at the same time she knew that the freedom now permitted made it easy for a man to turn a girl 's head , and knew how lightly men regarded an offence of that kind .
during THE interval between dinner and the beginning of the evening party , Kitty experienced something resembling a young man 's feelings before a battle .
on the other hand when she pictured to herself a future with Vronsky a brilliant vision of happiness rose up before her , while a future with Levin appeared wrapped in mist .
at half @-@ past seven , as soon as she had come down into the drawing @-@ room , the footman announced ' Constantine Dmitrich Levin ! '
he too sat down until the arrival of other guests should enable him to get away unnoticed .
her constant and favourite amusement was to make fun of him .
'i love it when he looks down at me from the height of his dignity , or breaks off his clever conversation because I am too stupid , or when he shows his condescension toward me .
'no , Princess , I am no longer on the Zemstvo , ' he answered , ' I have come to Moscow for a few days . '
but I 'll draw him out , I do love to make a fool of him when Kitty 's about , and I will . '
Vronsky was a dark sturdily @-@ built man of medium height , with a good @-@ natured , handsome , exceedingly quiet and firm face .
everything about his face and figure - from his black closely @-@ cropped hair and freshly @-@ shaven chin to his wide , brand @-@ new uniform - was simple and at the same time elegant .
having greeted and spoken a few words to every one else , he sat down without having once looked at Levin , who had not taken his eyes off him .
and Naples and Sorrento are pleasant only for a short stay , and it is there that one thinks of Russia , and longs especially for the Russian countryside .
Levin wished to join in the general conversation , but found it impossible , and kept saying to himself , ' Now I will go , ' yet he did not go , but waited for something indefinite .
'Very well , next Saturday , ' replied the Countess Nordston . ' and you ; Mr. Levin , do you believe in it ? ' she asked , turning to him .
we admit the existence of electricity , which we don 't understand , why can 't there be other forces which we do not yet know , but which ... '
just as the others began settling round the table and Levin was about to go , the old Prince came in , and having greeted the ladies he turned to Levin .
Vronsky 's unflinching eye glanced in astonishment at the old Prince , and slightly smiling he at once began talking to the Countess Nordston about the ball that was to take place the next week .
this one is a little Petersburg fop . they are machine @-@ made by the dozen , all to one pattern , and all mere rubbish .
'i know this much , ' the Princess interrupted him , ' that if I were to listen to what you say we should never see our daughter married , and we had better go and live in the country . '
no , certainly not , but a young man and an excellent young man falls in love with Kitty , and she too seems ... '
I can recognize a man who has serious intentions - such as Levin - and I can see through a weathercock like that popinjay who only wishes to amuse himself . '
and having made the sign of the cross over one another and kissed , feeling that each of them retained their individual opinions , the couple separated for the night .
his mother in her youth had been a brilliant Society woman , and during her married life and especially in her widowhood had had many love affairs , known to everybody .
on leaving that Corps as a very young and brilliant officer he at once joined the swim of the wealthy military Petersburg set .
in Moscow , after this luxurious course of Petersburg life , he experienced for the first time the delight of intimacy with a sweet , innocent Society girl who fell in love with him .
I feel myself better and purer , I feel I have a heart and that there is much that is good in me .
'i don 't know how it is that all Muscovites , present company of course excepted , ' Vronsky put in jokingly , ' are so abrupt .
the approach of the train was made more and more evident by the increasing bustle and preparation on the platform and the arrival of people who had come to meet the train .
it was as if an excess of vitality so filled her whole being that it betrayed itself against her will , now in her smile , now in the light of her eyes .
his mother , a thin old woman with black eyes and curled hair , screwed up her eyes as she recognized her son and her thin lips smiled slightly .
'She is very charming , isn 't she ? ' said the Countess , referring to Mrs. Karenina . ' her husband put her into the compartment with me and I was very pleased .
'There , Countess , you have met your son and I my brother , ' she said , ' and I have exhausted my stock of stories and should have had nothing more to tell you . '
you are one of those charming women with whom it is nice to talk , and nice to be silent . but please don 't fret about your son , you can 't expect never to be parted . '
he pressed the little hand , and the firm grip with which she shook his gave him unusual pleasure .
the old major @-@ domo , who had accompanied the Countess on her journey , came in and announced that everything was ready , and the Countess rose to go .
Vronsky gave his arm to his mother , but , just as they were coming out of the carriage , several people ran past them with frightened faces .
the ladies re @-@ entered the carriage , while Vronsky and Oblonsky followed the crowd , to find out about the accident .
a watchman , either tipsy or too much muffled up because of the severe frost , had not heard a tram that was being shunted , and had been run over .
when he returned a few minutes later Oblonsky was already talking to the Countess about the new opera singer , while she was impatiently glancing at the door in expectation of her son .
they went together , Vronsky walking in front with his mother , Mrs. Karenina following with her brother .
'For the widow , ' said Vronsky , shrugging his shoulders . ' I don 't understand what need there is to ask . '
Mrs. Karenina got into her brother 's carriage , and Oblonsky noticed with surprise that her lips were trembling and that it was with difficulty she kept back her tears .
on reaching his house , he helped his sister out of the carriage , pressed her hand , and drove off to his office .
it was true that , as far as she could remember her visit to the Karenins in Petersburg , she had not liked their house : there seemed to be something false in the tone of their family life .
and when she heard soft steps and the rustle of petticoats already in the doorway , she looked round with an expression not of pleasure but of surprise on her careworn face .
dear me , how he has grown ! ' said Anna , and having kissed him , she stood with her eyes fixed on Dolly and blushed . ' no , please do not let us go anywhere . '
she not only mentioned them all by name , but remembered the years and even the months of their births , their characters , and what illnesses they had had ; and Dolly could not help appreciating this .
what is the best way of acting in this dreadful position ? that is what one has to consider . '
I know they say husbands tell their wives how they have lived , but Steve ... ' She corrected herself .
'But Stephen Arkadyevich never told me anything . you will hardly believe it , but up to now I thought I was the only woman he had ever known .
to be fully convinced of one 's happiness and suddenly ... ' continued Dolly , suppressing her sobs , ' to read a letter , his letter to his mistress , my children 's governess . no , it is too horrible ! '
'Yes , I understand that his position is dreadful ; it is worse for the guilty than for the innocent one , ' she said , ' if he feels that the misfortune all comes from his fault .
I have served his purpose and lost all I had in the service , and of course a fresh , good @-@ for @-@ nothing creature now pleases him better .
you are so deeply hurt , so upset , that you see many things in the wrong light . '
they manage in some way to hold these women in contempt and don 't let them interfere with the family .
she spent the earlier part of the day with Dolly and the children , and sent a note to her brother to be sure and come home to dinner .
after dinner , when Dolly had gone to her own room , Anna got up quickly and went to her brother who was just lighting a cigar .
here , take this , ' she said , turning to Tanya who was drawing off a ring which fitted loosely on her aunt 's small tapering finger .
Grisha , please don 't pull so hard , it is all in a tangle already , ' she said , arranging a loose lock of hair with which Grisha was playing .
there 's Miss Hull calling you to tea , ' she went on , disengaging herself from the children and dispatching them to the dining @-@ room .
'She particularly wished me to go and see her , ' continued Anna . ' I shall be glad to see the old lady again , and will go to @-@ morrow .
'all together ! ' said Anna laughing and running to meet them , and putting her arms round them she tumbled the whole heap of children - struggling and shrieking joyfully - on to the floor .
the BALL HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN when Kitty and her mother ascended the broad staircase which was deluged with light , decorated with flowering plants , and occupied by powdered footmen in red liveries .
Kitty smiled , here at the ball , when she caught sight of it again in the mirror .
her eyes shone and she could not keep her rosy lips from smiling at the consciousness of her attractive appearance .
she looked about for some one to hold her fan and the mistress of the house took it from her with a smile .
bending her left arm she put her hand on his shoulder , and her little feet in their pink shoes began moving quickly , lightly , and rhythmically in time with the music , over the smooth parquet floor .
the only noticeable things about it were the wilful ringlets that always escaped at her temples and on the nape of her neck and added to her beauty .
'Well , if it is impossible not to dance to @-@ night , let us dance , ' she said taking no notice of Vronsky 's bow and quickly putting her hand on Korsunsky 's shoulder .
'Pardon , pardon , a waltz - a waltz , ' shouted Korsunsky from the other end of the room , and seizing the first girl within reach he himself began dancing .
she was sure that she would dance the mazurka with him as at previous balls , and she refused five other partners for that dance , saying that she was already engaged .
she had not come across Anna since the beginning of the ball , and now she suddenly saw her again in a different and unexpected light .
'no , it is not the admiration of the crowd that intoxicates her , but the rapture of one , and that one is ... can it be he ? '
only the thorough training she had had enabled and obliged her to do what was expected of her , that is , to dance , to answer the questions put to her , to talk , and even to smile .
but before the mazurka began , when the chairs were already being placed for it , and several couples moved from the small to the large ball @-@ room , Kitty was for a moment seized with despair .
and she saw them with her far @-@ sighted eyes , she saw them close by , too ; when they met in the dance , and the more she saw of them the surer she was that the blow had fallen .
on Vronsky 's face , usually so firm and self @-@ possessed she noticed that expression of bewilderment and submission which had so surprised her - an expression like that of an intelligent dog when it feels guilty .
in the middle of the mazurka , performing a complicated figure newly @-@ invented by Korsunsky , Anna stepped into the middle of the room and chose two men and two ladies , one of whom was Kitty , to join her .
of course , from Prokofy 's point of view , who saw him in a ragged coat and tipsy , he is a despicable fellow ; but I know him from another side .
Levin went up to a lamp @-@ post and read his brother 's address which he had in his pocket @-@ book , and then hired a sledge .
he remembered an affair with a sharper to whom his brother had lost money , and whom he had first given a promissory note and then prosecuted on a charge of fraud .
he was teased and called ' Noah ' and ' monk , ' and then when he broke loose no one helped him , but all turned away from him with horror and disgust .
his hair was thinner but the same straight moustache covered his lips ; and the same eyes with their peculiar , naive gaze looked out at the new @-@ comer .
and our society has so shaped itself that the more the people work the richer the merchants and landowners will become , while the people will remain beasts of burden for ever .
'Yes , of course , ' said Constantine , looking intently at the hectic flush which had appeared on his brother 's face below its prominent cheek bones .
'And so we are starting a locksmiths ' Association , in which all the products and the profits and , above all , the instruments of production will be common property . '
'Have you read his article ? ' he said , turning to Kritsky again , sitting down to the table and clearing away from it a heap of half @-@ filled cigarettes to make room .
but it is a different matter with me . I see through his thought , and therefore know why it is weak . '
'If you want my full confession about it , I will tell you that I take no side in your quarrel with Sergius Ivanich .
Masha promised to write to Constantine in case of need , and to try to persuade Nicholas to go and live with him .
secondly , he would never again allow himself to be carried away by passion , the repulsive memory of which had so tormented him when he was making up his mind to propose .
a light fell on the snow @-@ covered space in front of the house from the windows of the room of his old nurse Agatha Mikhaylovna , who now acted as his housekeeper .
Laska , a setter bitch , ran out too , almost throwing Kuzma off his feet , and whined and rubbed herself against Levin 's knees , jumping up and wishing but not daring to put her front paws on his chest .
when he saw all this , he was overcome by a momentary doubt of the possibility of starting the new life of which he had been dreaming on his way .
his steward entered and said that , ' the Lord be thanked , ' everything was all right , but that the buckwheat had burned in the new drying kiln .
the steward had always been against the new kiln , and now proclaimed with suppressed triumph that the buckwheat had got burnt .
there was a warm steaming smell of manure when the frozen door opened , and the cows , astonished at the unaccustomed light of the lantern , began moving on their clean straw .
Vasily Fedorich , isn 't she fine ? ' he said , turning to the steward , and quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his satisfaction about the calf .
it WAS A large OLD @-@ fashioned HOUSE , and though only Levin was living in it , he used and heated the whole of it .
Stephen Oblonsky was not dining at home , but promised to be back at seven to see his sister off .
her eyes shone peculiarly and kept filling with tears . ' I did not want to leave Petersburg , and now I do not want to leave here . '
Oblonsky , smelling of wine and cigars , with his face red and happy , came in late , just as she was about to start .
Annushka was already dozing , her broad hands , with a hole in one of the gloves , holding the red bag on her lap .
but there was nothing to be done , so she forced herself to read , while her little hand toyed with the smooth paper @-@ knife .
'Well , what of it ? ' she finally said to herself with decision , changing her position on the seat . ' what does it signify ?
to get over it she rose , threw off her wrap , and took off the cape of her coat .
she asked Annushka to give her the cape she had removed and a shawl , and putting them on she moved to the door .
a blustering storm WAS rushing and whistling between the wheels of the train and round the pillars and the corners of the station .
though she could remember neither his nor her own words , she instinctively felt that that momentary conversation had drawn them terribly near to one another , and this both frightened her and made her happy .
at once thoughts of home , her husband , her son , and the cares of the coming day and of those that would follow , beset her .
it was that ordinary well @-@ known feeling , as if she were dissembling , which she experienced in regard to her husband , but formerly she had not noticed it , while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it .
when he had got out of the train at Bologoe station to drink a glass of Seltzer water and had seen Anna , he had involuntarily at once told her just what he was thinking about it .
when he returned to the train , he kept recalling all the positions in which he had seen her , and all her words ; and in his imagination , causing his heart to stand still , floated pictures of a possible future .
Karenin 's gait , the swinging of his thighs , and his wide short feet , particularly offended Vronsky , who acknowledged only his own unquestionable right to love Anna .
he saw the husband and wife meet , and with the penetration of a lover he noticed the signs of slight embarrassment when she spoke to her husband .
by addressing himself thus to his wife he conveyed to Vronsky his wish to be alone with her , and turning to Vronsky he touched his hat . but Vronsky , addressing Anna , said :
'You insist too much on your devotion , for me to value it greatly , ' she replied in the same playful tone , while she involuntarily listened to the sound of Vronsky 's footsteps following them .
and , do you know , if I may advise , you should go and see her to @-@ day .
Countess Lydia Ivanovna was Anna 's husband 's friend and the centre of that set in Petersburg Society with which Anna , through her husband , was most closely connected .
now I Shan 't have to dine alone , ' he went on , no longer in a bantering manner . ' you can 't think how I used ... '
'i am getting tired of breaking lances uselessly in the cause of truth , and sometimes I feel quite unstrung .
'This is all just as it was before , but how is it that I never noticed it before ? ' said Anna to herself . ' or is it that she is specially irritated this morning ?
but it is really funny ; her aim is to do good , she is a Christian and yet she is always angry and always has enemies - all on account of Christianity and philanthropy ! '
after the Countess had left , a friend - a high official 's wife - arrived and gave Anna all the Petersburg news .
the feeling of causeless shame she had felt during the journey , and her agitation , had quite vanished .
Karenin returned FROM THE MINISTRY at four o 'clock , but , as often happened , he had no time to go up and see his wife .
at dinner he spoke a little about Moscow affairs with his wife , asking with an ironical smile after Stephen Oblonsky ; but for the most part the conversation was general and dealt with Petersburg service and social affairs .
after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests , and then , having again with a smile pressed his wife 's hand , went away to the Council .
the dressmaker came to explain that it was better as she had done it , and Anna lost her temper to such a degree that she afterwards felt ashamed .
exactly at half @-@ past nine there was a ring at the front door , and he entered the room .
'Yes , quite , ' she replied , and related everything that had happened from the beginning : her journey with the Countess Vronskaya , her arrival , the accident at the railway station .
'Here , on the contrary , it has made quite a stir , ' he said with a self @-@ satisfied smile .
with the same self @-@ satisfied smile he told her about the ovations he had received on account of the enactment of that Statute .
she knew that in spite of his time being almost entirely absorbed by the duties of his post , he considered it incumbent on him to follow everything of importance that appeared in the world of thought .
he liked talking of Shakespeare , Raphael and Beethoven , and about the importance of the new schools of poetry and music , which in his mind were all classified with very logical exactitude .
when HE WENT TO Moscow , Vronsky had left his large flat on the Morskaya to his friend and favourite comrade , Petritsky .
when he rang the bell , while still outside , he heard men 's laughter , a woman 's lisping voice , and Petritsky shouting : ' if it is one of the villains , don 't let him in ! '
Petritsky in his great coat , and Captain Kamerovsky in full uniform probably straight from parade , sat on each side of her .
I hope you are pleased with this ornament to your study , ' he added , pointing to the Baroness . ' of course , you know one another ? '
'i should think so ! ' replied Vronsky with a merry smile , as he pressed the Baroness 's small hand . ' of course : quite old friends . '
Kamerovsky rose also , and , without waiting for him to go , Vronsky shook hands with him and went to his dressing @-@ room .
listening to Petritsky 's familiar tales , in the familiar surroundings of the house he had lived in for three years , Vronsky experienced the satisfaction of returning to his customary careless Petersburg life .
'Oh , about Buzulukov there is such a tale - splendid ! ' shouted Petritsky . ' you know his passion for balls ?
she sees our dear Buzulukov standing there ' - Petritsky imitated the pose ' the Grand Duchess asks him for his helmet , but he won 't let her have it !
toward THE END OF THE WINTER a consultation was held at the Shcherbatskys ' which was intended to ascertain the state of Kitty 's health and to decide what should be done to restore her failing strength .
he saw that it was waste of time to talk to him , and that the head in this house was the mother .
'But in favour of a journey abroad I should like to mention the change of habits , and the removal from surroundings which awaken memories .
the celebrity informed the Princess ( his sense of what was fitting suggested this to him ) that he would have to see the patient again .
such a discovery could now only deprive her of her accustomed family life , and she let herself be deceived , despising him , and especially herself , for such weakness .
added to this the care of a large family worried her continually : either something went wrong with the feeding of the baby or the nurse left , or , as now , one of the children fell ill .
one can 't get at one 's real daughter , but only caresses the hair of expired females .
when Kitty , in tears , had left the room , Dolly , with her motherly habit of mind , at once saw that here a woman 's task lay before her , and prepared to fulfil it .
she took off her bonnet and , having mentally rolled up her sleeves , prepared for action .
'i am going home now and shall have to shut myself up , and you won 't be able to come to me , ' said Dolly , sitting down beside her sister . ' I want to talk to you . '
she turned on her chair , blushed , and began rapidly moving her fingers , pressing now with one hand and now with the other the buckle of a belt she was holding .
and it is my sister who says that to me . my sister who imagines ... that ... that she sympathizes with me ! ...
the mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kitty of the last fragments of self @-@ control : she jumped up from her chair , threw the buckle on the floor , and rapidly gesticulating with her hands she began :
Mama takes me to a ball : and it seems to me she only takes me there to marry me off as quickly as possible and get rid of me .
formerly to go anywhere in a ball @-@ dress was just a pleasure to me . I used to like myself in it ; but now I feel ashamed and uncomfortable .
and Kitty insisted on having her own way , went to her sister 's , and nursed the children all through the scarlet fever that really attacked them .
the two sisters nursed all the six children successfully through the illness , but Kitty 's health did not improve , and in Lent the Shcherbatskys went abroad .
Karenin set great value on this circle , and Anna , who knew how to get on with every one , had during the first part of her life in Petersburg made friends in it too .
he knew very well that he ran no risk of appearing ridiculous either in Betsy 's eyes or in the eyes of Society people generally .
I 'll give you a hundred or a thousand guesses - and you won 't find out !
'What ? from Nilsson ? ' asked Betsy , quite horrified , though she could not have distinguished Nilsson 's voice from that of a chorus girl .
they see that a pretty woman in a hired sledge is passing them , looking at them , and laughing and nodding to them - at any rate they think so .
they only manage to see a pair of red lips beneath a short veil , and lovely little feet ... '
well , the young men go into their comrade 's flat . he was giving a farewell dinner .
no one knows ; but their host 's footman , in answer to their question whether " girls " lived there , replies that there are a lot of them thereabouts .
a maid opens the door ; they give her the letter and assure her that they are both so much in love that they will die at once on the doorstep .
the titular Councillor lodges a complaint , and I turn into a peacemaker - and what a peacemaker ! ...
" I agree that they acted badly , but beg you to consider that it was a mistake ; consider their youth ; besides which the young men had just dined .
they repent from the bottom of their hearts , and ask you to forgive their fault . "
these officers , in their sledge , raced after her ; she became frightened , and feeling still more unwell ran up the stairs to her flat .
Wenden himself , having returned from his office and hearing the front @-@ door bell and voices , went out , saw the tipsy officers with the letter , and hustled them out .
Vronsky realized how ungrateful a task it was - that a duel was out of the question , and that everything must be done to soften the titular Councillor and hush up the affair .
having reached the French Theatre , Vronsky went out into the foyer with the C.O. , and informed him of his success or lack of success .
wonderful ! ' he went on , referring to the new French actress . ' however often one sees her , she is new each day .
the conversation in both circles , as always happens at first , hesitated for a few minutes , was interrupted by greetings , recognitions , and offers of tea , and seemed to be seeking something to settle on .
'She is wonderfully good as an actress , one sees that she has studied Kaulbach , ' remarked an attaché in the circle round the ambassador 's wife . ' did you notice how she fell ... '
this was the Princess Myagkaya , notorious for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners , and nicknamed l 'enfant terrible .
'Have you heard ? that that Maltyshcheva woman also - not the daughter but the mother - is having a diable rose costume made for herself ? '
'What ? have you been to the Schuzburgs ? ' asked the hostess from her place by the samovar .
he is such a remarkable man , ' said the ambassador 's wife . ' my husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe . '
'no one is satisfied with his position , but every one is satisfied with his wit , ' remarked the attaché , quoting some French lines .
'But I don 't even think of blaming her ! ' Anna 's friend said , justifying herself .
but immediately , nodding rapidly to her acquaintances and pressing the hands extended to her , she turned again to her hostess :
'When I was young I was in love with a chorister , ' said Princess Myagkaya . ' I don 't know whether it did me any good . '
'i ask only one thing : I ask the right to hope and suffer as I do now ; but if even that is impossible , command me to disappear , and I will do it .
'Your Hotel Rambouillet is in full muster , ' said he , glancing round the whole company , ' the graces and the Muses . '
after half an hour 's stay Karenin went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together ; but , without looking at him , she answered that she would stay to supper .
she gave him her hand , and with her quick elastic step went past the hall @-@ porter and vanished into the carriage .
with the book under his arm he went upstairs ; but to @-@ night , instead of his usual thoughts and calculations about his official affairs , his mind was full of his wife and of something unpleasant that had happened concerning her .
he now experienced a sensation such as a man might feel who , while quietly crossing a bridge over an abyss , suddenly sees that the bridge is being taken to pieces and that he is facing the abyss .
'i must think it over , come to a decision , and throw it off , ' he said aloud .
as head of the family I am the person whose duty it is to guide her , and who is therefore partly responsible ; I must show her the danger which I see , warn her , and even use my authority .
by the sound of her light step on the stair he was aware of her approach and , though he was satisfied with his speech , he felt some apprehension of the coming explanations .
her face shone with a vivid glow , but it was not a joyous glow - it resembled the terrible glow of a conflagration on a dark night .
more than that , he knew from her tone that she was not ashamed of this , but seemed to be saying frankly : ' yes , it is closed , and so it should be and will be in future . '
as she spoke she wondered at her quietly natural tone and at her correct choice of words .
your feelings concern your own conscience , but it is my duty to you , to myself , and to God , to point out to you your duties .
Oh dear ! and as ill @-@ luck will have it , I am dreadfully sleepy ! ' said she , while with deft fingers she felt for the remaining pins in her hair .
for an instant her head had drooped and the mocking spark in her eyes had died away , but the word ' love ' aroused her again .
for a moment the sound he emitted seemed to have startled Karenin , and he stopped ; but , after he had breathed twice , the whistling recommenced with fresh and calm regularity .
for a long time she lay still with wide @-@ open eyes , the brightness of which it seemed to her she could herself see in the darkness .
but in spite of the murderer 's horror of the body of his victim , that body must be cut in pieces and hidden away , and he must make use of what he has obtained by the murder .
now that years have passed , when I remember it , I am surprised that it could have grieved me so much .
he could not find peace , because he had so long dreamed of family life and felt so ripe for it , but was still unmarried and further than ever from marriage .
he himself felt painfully what all those around him felt too , that it is not good for a man of his age to be alone .
meanwhile spring had come , a glorious steady spring , without the expectations and disappointments spring usually brings . it was one of these rare springs which plants , animals , and men alike rejoice in .
Easter found snow still on the ground ; but on Easter Monday a warm wind began to blow , the clouds gathered , and for three days and nights warm stormy rain poured down .
on the Thursday the wind fell and a thick grey mist rose as if to hide the secret of the changes nature was carrying on .
in the morning the bright rising sun quickly melted the thin ice on the water and the warm air all around vibrated with the vapour given off by the awakening earth .
the cows had been let out there , and , warmed by the sunshine , their glossy new coats glistening , they were lowing to be let out into the fields .
he sent for the carpenter , who was under contract to be with the threshing @-@ machine , but it turned out that he was mending the harrows , which should have been mended the week before Lent .
he found out that the racks which were not wanted in winter had been taken into the farm @-@ horses ' stable , and there had got broken , as they were lightly made , being meant only for the calves .
Levin sent for the steward , but instead of waiting went at once to look for him himself .
'It 's not a case of such people , but of such a steward ! ' said Levin flaring up .
'Five are making compote ' ( he meant compost ) ' and four are turning the oats over . they might begin sprouting , Constantine Dmitrich . '
'Ignat ! ' he called to the coachman , who with sleeves rolled up was washing a carriage at the pump , ' saddle me ... '
'i 'll send right enough , ' said Vasily Fedorich , the steward , despondently . ' but the horses too are getting weak . '
'You won 't be able to cross the brook , Constantine Dmitrich , ' the coachman called out .
and Levin rode across the muddy yard and out of the gate into the field at a brisk amble , his fresh little horse snorting at the puddles and pulling at the bridle .
dreaming such dreams , carefully guiding his horse so as not to trample down his young growth , he rode up to the labourers who were sowing the clover .
when Vasily came up Levin told him to take the cart and horse on to the border .
'But the sowing , Constantine Dmitrich , is getting on first @-@ rate , ' he said making up to the master .
'Oh , but we crumble it up , ' said Vasily , taking a handful and rubbing the earth between his palms .
Levin mounted his horse and rode to the field where clover had been sown the year before , and to another which was deeply ploughed and ready for sowing the spring wheat .
Levin rode on at a trot , so as to have dinner and get his gun ready for the evening .
as Levin , IN THE highest SPIRITS , was nearing the house he heard the sound of a tinkling bell approaching the main entrance .
but he was ashamed of that feeling , and immediately , as it were , opened out his spiritual arms and with tender joy expected , and now hoped with his whole soul , that it was his brother .
'It would have been worse still on wheels , Constantine Dmitrich , ' said the driver , whom Levin knew .
Agatha Mikhaylovna , always much concerned about the honour of the house , met him in the hall with questions about dinner .
when he returned , Oblonsky , fresh and clean , with hair brushed , and face radiant with smiles , was just coming out of his room , and they went upstairs together .
a pretty house @-@ maid with a little apron would be preferable ; but with your severe and monastic style this one is more suitable . '
Oblonsky had much interesting news to tell , and one item of special interest to Levin was that his brother , Sergius Ivanich , intended to come and stay in the country with him that summer .
you know I am quite an outsider in these matters , but I should think this theory and its application ought to influence the labourer too . '
Oblonsky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the varnished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
Kuzma , already scenting a substantial tip , did not leave Oblonsky for a moment . he put on his stockings and his boots for him , and Oblonsky willingly allowed him to do so .
he sat down , wrapped a rug round his legs , and lit a cigar . ' how is it you don 't smoke . ?
I am made that way . and really so little harm is done to anyone , and one gets so much pleasure ... '
when they had reached the wood Levin got down and led Oblonsky to the corner of a mossy and marshy glade , already free from snow .
the sun was setting behind the forest , and the little birches interspersed among the aspen trees stood out clearly against the evening glow with their drooping branches and their swollen buds ready to burst into leaf .
from the thicket , where the snow had not all melted , the water still flowed in branching streamlets with a gentle rippling sound .
one can hear and see the grass growing , ' thought Levin , as he noticed a wet slate @-@ coloured aspen leaf move close to the point of a blade of grass .
Oblonsky 's figure again disappeared behind the bush , and Levin only saw the flare of a match , followed by the red glow of a cigarette and a spiral of blue smoke .
Levin looked to the right and to the left , and there before him against the dull light @-@ blue sky , over the lower branches of the aspen tops , appeared the flying birds .
through the young birches , Venus bright and silvery , was already shining with her delicate glitter low down in the west and high up in the east flickered the red fire of the dim Arcturus .
'Stephen ! ' said Levin suddenly and unexpectedly ' why don 't you tell me whether your sister @-@ in @-@ law is married , or when she will be ? '
and no dealer will ever buy without first counting , unless the forest is given to him for nothing , as you are doing .
he was a tall , spare , middle @-@ aged man , with a moustache , a prominent shaven chin , and prominent dim eyes .
he wiped his face all round with his handkerchief , and smoothing his coat , which was already quite in order , smilingly greeted the new arrivals . he held out his hand to Oblonsky as if he were trying to catch something .
on entering the study Ryabinin looked round by force of habit as though to find the icon , but after finding it he did not cross himself .
'i can do that , ' said Ryabinin , sitting down and putting his arm on the back of his chair in a most uncomfortable way . ' you must let me off something , Prince .
Levin , who had been putting away his gun in a cupboard , was just going out of the door , but on hearing the dealer 's words he stopped .
'He is very close , is Constantine Dmitrich , ' he said , addressing Oblonsky with a smile . ' it 's absolutely impossible to buy anything of him .
if you have , there 's no use bargaining , but if not , ' said Levin , ' I will buy the forest myself . '
'If you please , the forest is mine , ' he said , rapidly crossing himself and holding out his hand . ' take your money , the forest is mine .
that 's the way Ryabinin does business , no fussing about kopeks , ' he said , frowning and flourishing his pocket @-@ book .
'If I were you I should not be in a hurry to take it , ' remarked Levin .
why , I am making this purchase , believe me , just for the honour and glory of the thing , so that it should be Ryabinin and not another that has bought Oblonsky 's forest .
an hour later the dealer ; with his coat well lapped over , the hooks of his overcoat carefully fastened , and with the agreement in his pocket , seated himself in his little cart and drove home .
" that 's so , " responded the clerk , handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron . " but I can congratulate you on the purchase , Mihail Ignatitch ? "
the stupid sale of the forest , the swindle Oblonsky had fallen a prey to , which had been perpetrated in his house , irritated him .
Oblonsky wrinkled his face good @-@ naturedly , like an innocent man who was being hurt and interfered with .
'Oh don 't ! ' he said . ' when has a man ever sold anything without being told immediately after that it was worth much more ?
and impoverished not from extravagance . that would not matter so much : to spend like a nobleman is their business - only the noblesse know how to do it .
Oblonsky sat down to table and began joking with Agatha Mikhaylovna , assuring her that it was long since he had had such a dinner and supper as that day .
there was one question he wanted to put to Oblonsky , but could not bring himself to ask , nor could he find the form to put it in or the moment to ask it .
'Yes , by the by , where is Vronsky now ? ' he asked , suddenly putting down the soap .
I want to tell you candidly that if I were you , I 'd came to Moscow now with me , and ... '
on THE DAY OF THE Krasnoe Selo RACES Vronsky came earlier than usual to the regimental mess @-@ room to eat his beefsteak .
he sat waiting with his elbows on the table and his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat , and while waiting for the beefsteak he had ordered he looked at the pages of a French novel that lay on his plate .
he went to the Karenins ' country house * as seldom as possible , but now he meant to go there and was considering how to do it .
Vronsky glanced at them , frowned , and , as if he had not noticed them , turned his eyes on his book and began to eat and read at the same time .
'Suppose we have some Rhine wine , ' said the young one , turning his eyes timidly to Vronsky while his fingers tried to catch hold of his just @-@ budding moustache .
at that moment Captain Yashvin , a tall man with a fine figure , entered the room , and having given a contemptuous backward nod to the two officers he came up to Vronsky .
'That is wise , Alexis , ' said the captain in a loud baritone , ' eat now , and drink one small glass . '
he felt that Yashvin , though apparently despising all emotion , was the only one who could understand the power of the passion that now filled his whole life .
Vronsky did not talk to him of his love , but was aware that he knew all about it and understood it rightly , and it was pleasant to him to read this in Yashvin 's eyes .
he had really promised to go to Bryansky 's , who lived seven miles from Peterhof , and pay him for the horses , and he hoped to make time to call there too .
'Wait ! ' shouted Petritsky to Vronsky , who was already going out . ' your brother left a letter for you and a note . wait ! where are they ? '
'What business is it of theirs ? ' thought he , and crumpling up the letters he pushed them in between the buttons of his coat , to be read more attentively on the way .
'These are the things to restore me ! ' shouted Petritsky on seeing the new @-@ comers . the orderly stood before him with vodka and pickled cucumbers on a tray . ' Yashvin here has ordered vodka to freshen me up . '
'Well , you did give it us last night , ' said one of the new @-@ comers . ' you did not let us sleep all night . '
'To the stables ! ' he said , and was taking out the letter to read , but then changed his mind , not wishing to be upset before examining his horse . ' later will do ! ... '
the temporary STABLE , a wooden structure , had been built close to the racecourse , and it was there his mare was to have been brought the day before .
during these last days he had not exercised her himself , but had entrusted it to the trainer , and therefore did not in the least know in what condition she had arrived or now was .
'Frou @-@ Frou is the braver , but the other is the more powerful horse , ' said Vronsky , smiling at the compliment to his riding :
the mare is nervous , ' he added , nodding toward the closed horsebox before which they were standing , and from which was heard the trampling of hoofs among the straw .
but she possessed in the highest degree a characteristic which made one forget all her defects . this was her thoroughbred quality - the kind of blood that tells , as they say in English .
the mare 's excitement had communicated itself to Vronsky . he felt that the blood was rushing to his heart , and that he , like the horse , wished to move and to bite ; it was both frightening and joyful .
'Well then , I rely on you , ' said Vronsky to the Englishman . ' you will be on the spot at half @-@ past six . '
Vronsky raised his head in amazement and looked as he knew how to , not into the Englishman 's eyes but at his forehead , surprised at the boldness of the question .
he had not gone many yards before the clouds , which had been threatening since morning , broke , and there was a downpour of rain .
'This is bad ! ' thought Vronsky , raising the hood of the calèche . ' it was muddy before , but now it will be a swamp . '
sitting alone in the closed chalice he drew out his mother 's letter and his brother 's note and read them through .
she wore a white dress trimmed with wide embroidery , and as she sat in a corner of the verandah behind some plants , did not hear Vronsky coming .
bowing her curly head she pressed her forehead against a cold watering @-@ can that stood on the balustrade , and both her beautiful hands , with the rings he knew so well , were holding the can .
he wished to run toward her , but remembering that there might be others near , turned to look at the verandah door and blushed , as he always did when he felt that he had reason to fear and to be circumspect .
she did not answer , but , slightly bowing her head , looked at him from under her brows questioningly , her eyes shining from under their long lashes .
better not tell him , - why put him to the proof ? ' she thought , continuing to look at him in the same way and feeling that her hand with the leaf was trembling more and more .
the leaf in her hand shook still more violently , but she did not move her eyes from his face , watching to see how he would take it .
he gave her a look full of emotion , humbly kissed her hand , rose , and began silently pacing up and down the verandah .
only after going some five miles did he recollect himself sufficiently to look at his watch and to realize that it was already half @-@ past five , and that he was late .
he could be in time for his own race , but , if he called on Bryansky first he could only just manage it , and the whole Court would already be at the racecourse .
when he reached his quarters he found no one there - they had all gone to the races and his valet was waiting at the gate .
while he was changing his things , the valet told him that the second race had already begun and that many gentlemen had been to inquire for him , and a lad had run over twice from the stables .
having changed without hurrying ( he never hurried or lost his self @-@ control ) , Vronsky ordered the coachman to drive him to the stables .
from there he could see the sea of carriages , pedestrians , and soldiers surrounding the racecourse , and the stands , which were thronged with people .
on his way he met Makhotin 's white @-@ legged chestnut Gladiator , which in a blue @-@ bordered orange covering , with his ears looking enormous in their blue @-@ trimmed cloth , was being led to the course .
but he continually met acquaintances who stopped him , told him about the races that had been run , and asked him why he was so late .
'ah , there is Karenin ! ' said the acquaintance with whom he was talking . ' he is looking for his wife , and she is in the centre of the pavilion .
he had not had time to examine the saddle , about which he wished to give some directions , when the riders were summoned to the pavilion to draw their numbers and places .
cord , in honour of the races , was dressed in his best clothes : a black buttoned @-@ up coat , a stiff starched collar that pressed against his cheeks , a bowler hat , and top boots .
Galtsin , one of the formidable competitors and a friend of Vronsky 's , was struggling with a sorrel gelding that would not let him mount .
'Don 't hurry , ' said Cord to Vronsky , ' and remember one thing : do not hold back or urge on your horse at an obstacle . let her have her way . '
having got his right foot also in its stirrup he straightened out the double reins between his practised fingers , and Cord removed his hand .
the restive horse tugged at the reins , now to one side , now to the other , trying to deceive her rider , and Vronsky vainly sought by voice and hand to soothe her .
it was to take place on the large four @-@ verst elliptical course in front of the pavilion .
three times the riders drew up in line , but each time someone 's horse made a false start and they had to line up again .
it had looked to the public as if they had all started together , but the riders were aware of a difference of seconds which to them were of great importance .
these particulars Vronsky learned later , now he only saw that Diana 's head or legs might come just where Frou @-@ Frou had to alight .
but Frou @-@ Frou , like a falling cat , made an effort with her legs and back while in the air , and clearing the other horse rushed on .
after crossing the brook Vronsky had the mare quite under control , and held her in , intending to cross the big barrier behind Makhotin and then to try and pass him on the flat 300 yards before the next obstacle .
they ran side by side for a few strides , but before the obstacle they were approaching , Vronsky , not to lose ground , gave the mare her head and just on the declivity passed Makhotin .
Vronsky did not even look at it , but hoping to win by a distance , began working the reins with a circular movement , raising and dropping the mare 's head in time with her stride .
he himself , without knowing it , had made the unpardonable mistake of dropping back in his saddle and pulling up her head .
before he could realize this , the white legs of the gelding flashed close by him and Makhotin passed at a rapid gallop .
the mare again began to struggle like a fish , causing the flaps of the saddle to creak ; she got her front legs free , but unable to lift her hind @-@ quarters , struggled and immediately again fell on her side .
he turned away and , without picking up the cap that had fallen from his head , left the racecourse without knowing where he was going .
for the first time in his life he experienced the worst kind of misfortune - one that was irretrievable , and caused by his own fault .
he who had been a considerate father , since the end of that winter had become particularly cold toward his son , and treated him in the same bantering manner as he did his wife .
that was why Karenin 's face bore a stern , proud expression when anyone asked about his wife 's health .
once he dined there , and the other time he spent an evening with some visitors , but he had not once stayed the night , as he used to do in former years .
on the previous day the Countess Lydia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveller in China , and a letter asking him to receive this traveller , who for various reasons was very interesting and necessary to them .
at the same time as the traveller , a provincial Marshal of the Nobility was announced with whom Karenin had some things to talk over .
when he too had left , he had to finish his everyday business with his private secretary and had also to drive to see an important personage on a grave and serious matter .
he only managed to get back at five , his dinner @-@ time , and having dined with his private secretary , he invited the latter to drive with him to his country house and to go to the races with him .
'It is too early for Betsy , ' she thought , and glancing out of the window she saw the carriage , and sticking out of it a black hat and Karenin 's familiar ears . ' how unfortunate !
'i am going , good @-@ bye ! ' said Anna , and giving her son a kiss she went up to Karenin and held out her hand to him . ' you were very kind to come . '
two men - her husband and her lover - were the two centres of her life , and without the aid of her senses she was aware of the presence of either .
she was tormented by anxiety for Vronsky , but suffered even more from what seemed to her the incessant flow of her husband 's shrill voice with its familiar intonations .
and as it is natural for the child to skip about , so it was natural for him to speak cleverly and well .
'the danger in military , that is , cavalry , steeplechases is an unavoidable element of the racing .
'It is exciting , but one CANNOT tear oneself away , ' said another lady . ' if I had been a Roman , I should never have missed a gladiatorial show . '
and though the answer did not mean anything , the general made as though he had heard a clever reply from a clever man , and quite appreciated la Pointe de la sauce . '
'There are two sides to it , ' continued Karenin , ' that of the performers and that of the spectators . the love of such spectacles is the surest proof of low development in the onlookers , I admit , but ... '
Karenin was not interested in races and therefore did not watch the riders , but began absent @-@ mindedly looking at the spectators with his weary eyes .
by the end of the race every one was disturbed , and this disturbance was increased by the fact that the Emperor was displeased .
she put down her glasses and was about to go ; but at that moment an officer galloped up and reported something to the Emperor .
'no , Alexis Alexandrovich , ' she put in , ' I brought Anna here and I have promised to take her back again . '
'Don 't forget , ' said he to her , pointing at the open window behind the coachman 's box ; and , slightly rising , he lifted the window .
now that a complete disclosure was impending , he expected nothing so much as that she would , as before , answer him mockingly that his suspicions were ridiculous and groundless .
as they were driving up to it , he turned his face to her still with the same expression and said :
in the presence of the servants he pressed her hand , re @-@ entered the carriage , and drove off toward Petersburg .
when all this had become firmly established , Kitty began to feel very dull , especially as her father had gone to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother .
among these people she was specially interested in a young Russian girl who had come to the watering @-@ place with an invalid Russian lady , Madame Stahl , as every one called her .
Madame Stahl belonged to the highest Society , but she was so ill that she could not walk , and only on fine days occasionally appeared on the promenade in a bath @-@ chair .
soon after the Shcherbatskys ' arrival , two new persons who provoked everybody 's disapproval began to appear of a morning at the Wells .
but the Princess , having found out from the visitors ' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivanovna , explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was , and all her dreams about those two people vanished .
this Levin , by his habit of jerking his head , now inspired an irrepressible feeling of aversion in her .
it WAS A dull DAY , it rained the whole morning , and the patients with their umbrellas crowded the covered gallery .
Kitty was walking with her mother and the Moscow Colonel , who swaggered gaily in his short , German coat , bought ready @-@ made in Frankfort .
'Well , if you want to so much , I will inquire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' what do you see particular in her ?
that tall gentleman has been quarrelling with the doctor and insulting him , because he is dissatisfied with the doctor 's treatment . he shook his stick at him !
'Luckily that ... you know the girl with a hat like a mushroom - she 's Russian , I think - intervened , ' said the Colonel .
choosing a moment when her daughter had gone to the Well and Varenka had stopped in front of a baker 's shop , the Princess went up to her .
'Well , you see , his companion called me , and I tried to soothe him ; he is very ill and was dissatisfied with his doctor .
Madame Stahl , of whom some people said that she had tormented her husband to death , while others said that , by his immoral conduct , he had tormented her , had always been a sickly and ecstatic woman .
'See , ' said the Colonel , looking out of the window , ' what an audience has assembled to hear you . ' underneath the window a considerable crowd really had collected .
the Princess asked Varenka to sing again , and she sang another song just as truly , clearly , and well , standing straight at the piano , and beating time on it with her thin brown hand .
you did not think that I too have had a romance ? ' she said , and on her handsome face there flickered for an instant a spark of the fire which , Kitty felt , had once lighted up her whole being .
and once , when Kitty met a Roman Catholic priest at the house , she observed that Madame Stahl carefully hid her face behind the lampshade and smiled in a peculiar manner .
in Varenka she saw that it was only necessary to forget oneself and to love others in order to be at peace , happy , and lovely .
'Well , go if you like , ' said the Princess , looking intently into her daughter 's confused face and trying to guess the cause of her confusion .
it was one of those things which one knows and yet CANNOT say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
she remembered her first efforts to conquer the repulsion she felt for him , as for all consumptives , and her efforts to find something to say to him .
she remembered the timid look , full of emotion , with which he gazed at her , and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness followed by a consciousness of her own benevolence , that she had experienced .
quite TOWARD THE END OF THE SEASON Prince Shcherbatsky , who from Carlsbad had gone on to Baden and Kissingen to see some Russian friends and to ' inhale some Russian spirit , ' as he expressed it , returned to his family .
but these unpleasant rumours were soon drowned in that sea of kind @-@ hearted cheerfulness which was always within him and which was increased by the Carlsbad water .
'Introduce me , introduce me to your new friends , ' he said to his daughter , pressing her arm with his elbow . ' I have even taken a liking to your nasty Soden because it has done you so much good .
just at the entrance to the gardens they met the blind Madame Berthe with her guide , and the Prince was pleased by the tender look on the old Frenchwoman 's face when she heard Kitty 's voice .
'of course I know you , I 've heard all about you , ' the Prince said to her with a smile , by which Kitty saw with joy that her father liked Varenka . ' where are you hurrying so to ? '
the man raised his straw hat above his thin curly hair , uncovering a tall forehead with an unhealthy redness where the hat had pressed it .
'How is it you sent word to the Princess that we were not going ? ' he said in an irritable whisper , his voice failing him .
behind her was a sullen @-@ looking , robust German workman who pushed her bath @-@ chair .
'ah ! ' exclaimed the Prince , seeing the Moscow Colonel standing near by , and with a bow to Madame Stahl he moved away with his daughter and with the Moscow Colonel , who had joined them .
there remained only a short @-@ legged woman who was always lying down because she had a bad figure , and who tormented poor unresisting Varenka for not tucking her plaid the right way .
they knew his generosity , and in a quarter of an hour the sick Hamburg doctor , who lived upstairs , was looking with envy from his window at the merry party of healthy Russians gathered under the chestnut tree .
to this problem was added the change in her relations with the Petrovs , which had been so clearly and unpleasantly demonstrated that morning .
she felt almost as she used to feel when , as a child , she was locked up in a room for punishment and heard her sister 's merry laughter .
I have not conquered anybody , but here I have to take off my own boots and even put them outside the door myself .
there are times when one would give a whole month for a shilling and there are times when you would not give half an hour at any price .
'Oh dear , I have not laughed so much for a long time ! ' said Varenka , collecting her sunshade and bag . ' what a dear your Papa is ! '
'There is nothing special to tell , only Petrov used to want to leave sooner but now does not want to go , ' said Varenka smiling .
'It serves me right , it serves me right ! ' Kitty began hurriedly , snatching Varenka 's sunshade out of her hands , and looking past her friend 's eyes .
'It serves me right because it was all pretence , all invented and not heartfelt .
she was not as careless and light @-@ hearted as before , but she was at peace . her old Moscow sorrows were no more than a memory .
according to his views country life was preferable to any other , and he had now come to his brother 's house to enjoy it .
to say that he knew the peasants was tantamount to saying that he knew human beings .
with an elder brother 's condescension he sometimes explained to him the meaning of things , but could find no pleasure in discussion , because he could gain too easy a victory .
Koznyshev loved to lie basking in the sunshine , talking lazily .
'no ; I must just look in at the counting @-@ house for a moment , ' answered Levin , and off he ran to the fields .
it was the time of that short pause before the labour , yearly renewed , of getting in the harvest , which always demands all the peasants ' strength for its accomplishment .
Levin , on the contrary , was impatient to get home in order to give orders about hiring the mowers on the morrow , and to decide about the hay harvest , which greatly occupied his mind .
peering into the distance across the river , he made out something black in the cornfield , and could not see whether it was only a horse or the steward on horseback .
you have made an attempt , and because according to your judgment it was a failure , you gave it up .
Constantine felt that there was nothing for him but to submit or else to own to a lack of love for the common cause , and he felt wounded and grieved .
he remained silent awhile , lifted his rod and threw the line again , and then turned to his brother with a smile .
the roads are not better and CANNOT be made better , and my horses do manage to pull me over the bad ones .
I not only do not require schools , but they would even do me harm , as I have already told you .
'Come , ' smilingly interrupted Koznyshev , ' it was not our personal interest which induced us to work for the emancipation of the serfs , and yet we did it . '
'He too has some philosophy or other to serve his inclinations , ' he thought
the birches are not stuck in : some of them are planted , and others are sown and have to be tended carefully .
but while walking over the meadow he recalled the impression mowing had made on him , and almost made up his mind to do it .
'It 's ready , master ! like a razor , it will mow of itself , ' said Titus , taking off his cap and smiling as he handed the scythe .
the peasants , perspiring and merry , who had finished their swaths came out on to the road one after another , and laughingly exchanged greetings with the master .
'Mind , master ! having put your hand to the plough , don 't look back ! ' and Levin heard the sound of repressed laughter among the mowers .
'i will try not to lag behind , ' he said , taking his place behind Titus and waiting his turn to fall in .
when they had gone some hundred steps Titus was still going on without pausing , showing no signs of fatigue , while Levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep up , he felt so tired .
what gave him most pleasure was the knowledge that he would be able to keep up with the peasants .
some of the peasants went to put on their coats ; others as well as Levin felt pleasure in the refreshing rain and merely moved their shoulders up and down .
only then he remembered that he had not been right about the weather and that the rain was wetting the hay .
his pleasant young face , with a wisp of grass tied round the forehead over his hair , worked all over with the effort ; but whenever anyone glanced at him he smiled .
and really Levin thought he had never tasted any nicer drink than this lukewarm water with green stuff floating in it and a flavour of the rusty tin box .
all the mowers on reaching the river went across the swaths to where their coats lay , and where the children who had brought their dinners sat waiting for them .
some had a wash . the young lads bathed in the river ; others arranged places for their after @-@ dinner rest , unfastened their bags of bread and unstoppered their jugs of kvas .
the old man had already been long awake and sat setting the scythes for the young men .
a wide expanse of the meadow was already mown , and with its swaths of grass already giving off perfume , shone with a peculiar fresh brilliance in the oblique rays of the descending sun .
'What do you think - could we manage to get Mashkin Heights mown to @-@ day ? ' he asked the old man .
the sun was already setting toward the trees when , with their tin boxes rattling , they entered the wooded ravine of the Heights .
after a short consultation as to whether they should mow the ravine across or lengthwise , Prokhor - a gigantic dark man and a famous mower - took the lead .
on the short swaths the mowers crowded together , their tin boxes clattering , their scythes ringing whenever they touched , the whetstones whistling upon the blades , and their merry voices resounding as they urged each other on .
the old man , who had put on his sheepskin jacket , was still as jolly , witty , and easy in his movements as before .
the old man stooped each time he came upon one , picked it up , and put it inside his jacket , saying , ' Another treat for my old woman . '
it was easy to cut the wet soft grass , but on the other hand it was very difficult to go up and down the steep slopes of the ravine .
you know , I thought of coming to the meadow to have a look at you , but it was so unbearably hot that I got only as far as the forest !
'Possibly ; but it is a pleasure such as I have never in my life experienced before , and there is nothing wrong in it .
in the spring , when Oblonsky went there to sell the forest , Dolly had asked him to look over the house and have all necessary repairs done .
when he returned to Moscow he informed his wife that all was being prepared , that the house would look like a new toy , and advised her to move thither .
the day after her arrival it poured with rain and in the night the rain came through into the passage and nursery , so that the children 's beds had to be carried into the drawing @-@ room .
there was nowhere to hang dresses , because what few wardrobes there were would not shut , or else opened of themselves when anyone passed by .
she at once made friends with the steward 's wife , and on the very day of the removal drank tea with her and with the steward beneath the laburnums , discussing arrangements .
at THE END OF MAY , when the house was more or less in order , Dolly received from her husband an answer to her letter of complaint .
one of the frocks , which the English governess had undertaken to alter , was the cause of much bad blood .
the governess put the bodice darts in the wrong places , cut out the arm @-@ holes too big , and nearly spoilt the dress .
she was not dressing for her own sake , not for her own beauty , but in order , as the mother of all those charming children , not to spoil the general effect .
little Lily was charming in her naive wonder at everything around , and it was difficult to repress a smile when , having swallowed the bread and wine , she said in English , ' More , please ! '
on the plea of giving her dolls some dinner she had obtained leave from the governess to take her plateful of pudding to the nursery , but had brought it to her brother instead .
previously Miss Hull used to find one and point it out to her ; but this time Lily herself found a fine big one and there was a general shout of delight : ' Lily has found a mushroom ! '
when half the children were dressed again , some smartly @-@ dressed peasant women who had been gathering herbs came up and halted shyly by the bathing @-@ house .
Matrena Filimonovna called to one of these to ask her to dry a bath @-@ sheet and a chemise that had fallen into the water , and Dolly entered into conversation with them .
the peasant women , who had begun by laughing behind their hands without comprehending her questions , soon became bolder and more talkative , and at once captivated Dolly by their frank admiration of her children .
'Just look at the little beauty , as white as sugar ! ' said one , gazing admiringly at Tanya and stroking her head . ' but she 's thin . '
and the conversation turned upon the topic that interested Dolly more than any other : confinements , children 's illnesses , husbands ' whereabouts , and whether they came home often .
the women amused her and offended the English governess , who noticed that she was the object of their laughter , which she did not understand .
she was always glad to see him , but on this day was more pleased than ever because he would now see her in all her glory .
'of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me , and was very pleased .
I can well imagine how strange everything here must seem to you , used as you are to managing a town house ; and if you require anything I am quite at your disposal . '
she knew him , knew that he would be a good match for the young lady , and hoped the affair would come off .
'Don 't be afraid ! Don 't be afraid , Darya Alexandrovna ! there 's no fear of my hurting or dropping her , ' said he , smiling brightly at the mother .
and as she looked at his easy , strong , considerate , careful and ultra @-@ cautious movements , the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval .
'in that , at any rate , you are mistaken ; I did not know it , though I had my suspicions . '
'no , wait a bit , ' she answered , holding him by the sleeve . ' wait a bit . sit down . '
'Please , please don 't let us talk about it ! ' said he , sitting down again , conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him .
'Yes , now I understand it all , ' continued Dolly . ' you can 't understand it , you men who are free and have the choice .
she is expected to choose for herself , yet she has no choice ; she can only say " Yes " or " No . " -'
'Yes , a choice between me and Vronsky , ' thought Levin , and the dead hope that had begun to revive in his soul died again and only weighed painfully on his heart .
the local men opposed this innovation by all the means in their power , but the plan succeeded , and in the first year the meadows brought in almost double .
'Make hay while the sun shines , and you 'll have plenty , ' remarked the old beekeeper , sitting down beside Levin . ' it 's more like tea than hay !
the sounds of night - the ceaseless croaking of frogs , the snorting of horses through the morning mist over the meadow - could alone be heard .
awaking to reality Levin rose from his haycock , and glancing up at the stars realized that the night was nearly over .
the first was how to renounce his old life and discard his quite useless education .
the horses were pressing close together away from the ruts , but the skilful driver , sitting sideways on the box , guided them so that the coach wheels ran smoothly in the ruts .
in one corner an elderly woman was dozing ; and close to the window sat a young girl who had just wakened and was holding the ribbons of her white nightcap with both hands .
in the whole world there was only one being able to unite in itself the universe and the meaning of life for him .
all that had so disturbed Levin during the sleepless night and all his resolutions vanished suddenly .
there alone , inside that coach on the other side of the road , so rapidly receding from him , was the one possible solution of that riddle which had been weighing on him so painfully of late .
his wife 's words , confirming as they did his worst suspicions , had given Karenin a cruel pain in his heart .
what Karenin experienced was a feeling of this kind : it had been a strange and terrible pain , but it was past , and he felt he could again live , and think of other things beside his wife .
in his youth Karenin had been particularly attracted by the idea of duelling , just because he was physically a timid man and was quite aware of it .
this would happen : I , knowing beforehand that matters would never be allowed to reach a dangerous point , should have challenged a man in order to cover myself with false glamour .
having considered and rejected the idea of a duel , Karenin turned his thoughts to divorce , the next expedient of which some of the wronged husbands he remembered had availed themselves .
Karenin saw that in his own case it would be impossible to obtain a legal divorce - that is , a divorce in which the guilty wife would be simply cast off .
to attempt a divorce could only lead to a lawsuit and a scandal which would give his enemies great opportunity for calumny , and would lower his high position in Society .
he did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for impairing his peace of mind and his honour .
on entering the hall of his house he glanced at the letters and papers which had been sent from the Ministry and ordered them to be brought into his study .
with his elbow on the table and his head bent to one side he sat and thought for a minute , and then wrote without an instant 's pause .
my decision is as follows : whatever your actions may have been , I do not consider myself justified in severing the bonds with which a Higher Power has united us .
as the summer season is drawing to a close , I would ask you to return to Petersburg as soon as possible , and not later than Tuesday .
he read the letter over and was satisfied with it , especially with having remembered to enclose the money ; there was not a single cruel word or threat in it , yet it was not yielding in tone .
as soon as the footman , who had brought in the tea , had left the room , Karenin rose and went to the writing @-@ table .
the case of the subject races had been accidentally raised at the Committee of 2nd June and had been energetically insisted on by Karenin , as a matter of urgency in view of their wretched condition .
on her way back from the races , in a moment of excitement in spite of the pain it caused her - she had told her husband everything , and she was glad she had done so .
after he left her , she told herself that she was glad she had told him , that now everything would be definite - at any rate , the falsehood and deception would no longer exist .
when she thought about Vronsky , she imagined that he did not love her , that he was beginning to find her a burden , and that she could not offer herself to him ; and in consequence she felt hostile toward him .
the note was from Betsy , who reminded her that she ( Betsy ) was that day expecting Lisa Merkalova and the Baroness Stolz , with their admirers Kaluzhsky and old Stremov , to a game of croquet .
Anna read the note and sighed deeply . ' I don 't want anything , anything at all , ' she said to Annushka , who was moving the bottles and brushes on the dressing table .
'Serezha , ' she said as soon as the governess had gone away , ' it was wrong , but you won 't do it again ? ... You love me ? '
'Go to Mariette , ' she said to Serezha , who had come out after her , and she began pacing up and down the straw matting of the verandah .
'no , no , I must not think , ' she said to herself ; ' I must get ready to go .
'i have informed my husband , ' she began , and was unable to write any more .
in ALL THE ROOMS of the country house porters , gardeners , and footmen went about carrying out the things .
cupboards and chests of drawers stood open , twice the nearest shop had been sent to for balls of string . the floor was strewn with newspapers .
'Go and see what it is , ' she said , and , calmly prepared for anything , sat down in an easy @-@ chair and folded her hands on her knees .
no , I shall break it off , break it off ! ' she exclaimed , jumping up and forcing back her tears .
these considerations had made Anna reluctant to come , and it was to her refusal that the hints in Princess Tverskaya 's note had referred .
she felt inclined to ask where his master was ; she wanted to go home and write to him to come to her house , or to go to him herself . but none of these things could be done .
Betsy burst into an unexpected , merry and uncontrollable Peal of laughter , a thing she rarely did .
'It is all very well for you to laugh , ' said Anna , who could not help laughing too , ' but I never was able to understand it .
'You see , ' she said , ' I am in a lucky position ! I understand you and I understand Lisa .
now perhaps she is purposely ingenuous , ' and Betsy smiled pointedly . ' but still it becomes her .
she entered with a short , brisk step , in shoes with high French heels and shook hands with the ladies with a firm grip like a man .
'It may be that those who are not in our set are still more bored , but we - I at any rate - do not feel merry , but terribly , terribly bored . '
'the contrast will be too great , ' he remarked , ' if you go to see the old Countess Vrede after leaving this company here .
when Petritsky - who knew that on such occasions Vronsky was often cross - on waking saw his friend at his writing @-@ table , he dressed quietly and went out without disturbing him .
eight thousand roubles under the second heading were less important : they were owing chiefly for the use of the racecourse stables , to the oats and hay @-@ dealer , to the Englishman , to the Saddler and others .
his mother 's wish to bribe him offended him to the bottom of his soul and increased his coldness toward her .
he had made this proposal , but now , thinking it over , he saw clearly that it would be better to avoid that plan , and yet , while he told himself so , he feared that this might be wrong .
after returning to the table , the Commander again came forward with a glass of champagne in his hand and announced a toast : ' to the health of our late comrade , the gallant General , Prince Serpukhovskoy !
he jerked his head backwards and raised his glass , welcoming Vronsky and showing by this gesture that he must first go to the sergeant @-@ major , who was already stretching himself and puckering his lips for a kiss .
Serpukhovskoy kissed the smart @-@ looking sergeant @-@ major on his moist fresh lips and , wiping his mouth on his handkerchief , stepped up to Vronsky .
after that , feeling rather weak , he sat down on a bench in the yard and began demonstrating to Yashvin Russia 's superiority to Prussia , especially in cavalry charges , and the carousal quieted down for a moment .
Vronsky had taken off his coat and was washing his hairy red neck under the washstand tap , rubbing it and his head with his hands .
'i do not think so , ' and Serpukhovskoy smiled again . ' I do not mean to say I could not live without it , but it would be a bore .
I used to think the same , yet here I am living and find that it is not worth while living for that alone , ' said Vronsky .
how am I to put to you what I think ? ' and Serpukhovskoy , who was fond of similes , went on : ' wait a bit ! wait a bit ! ...
yes , if you had to carry a load and use your hands at the same time , it would be possible only if the load were strapped on your back : and that is marriage .
it gave him pleasure to feel the slight pain in his strong leg , to be conscious of the muscles of his chest moving as he breathed .
before reaching the avenue he ordered the coachman to stop , opened the carriage door , jumped out while the carriage was still moving , and went up the avenue leading to the house .
if at this news he would firmly , passionately , and without a moment 's hesitation say to her : ' give up everything and fly with me ! ' she would abandon her son and go with him .
'It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irritably . ' and here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her glove .
I hope ... ' he became confused and blushed ' that you will allow me to arrange and to think out a life for ourselves . to @-@ morrow ... '
he also felt something rising in his throat , and for the first time in his life he felt ready to cry .
she silently shook her head . ' would it not be possible to take your son away with you and go away all the same ? '
Anna 's carriage , which she had sent away and ordered to return to the gate of the Vrede Garden , drove up .
he remembered them all and did not even consider it necessary to go over in his mind what he was going to say .
there was silence for some time . ' is Serezha well ? ' he asked ; and without waiting for a reply he added , ' I am not dining at home to @-@ day and must be going at once . '
why did Darya Alexandrovna tell me this ? I might have met her accidentally and then all would have come naturally , but now it is impossible ! '
but now he was glad to go away from the proximity of Kitty and from his farm , and especially to go shooting , an occupation which served him as the best solace in all his troubles .
the dog that followed Levin frightened her , but when she was told that it would not hurt her she at once began to laugh at her own alarm .
in the midst of his conversation about his acquaintanceship with Sviyazhsky the gates creaked again , and the labourers returning from the fields came into the yard with their Ploughs and harrows .
'There in the passage , ' answered the old man , winding the reins into a ring and throwing them on the ground . ' fix them on before we finish dinner . '
'Why , I don 't know ! we have had tea once to @-@ day , ' said he , evidently pleased to accept the invitation . ' well , just for company ! '
ten years previously he had rented about four hundred acres from the landowner , and the year before he had bought them outright and rented another nine hundred from a neighbouring proprietor .
a small part of the land - the worst - he let , and with the aid of his family and two hired men cultivated about a hundred and twenty acres .
the vigorous young son with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge was saying something funny , and everybody laughed heartily - the woman with the goloshes laughing more merrily than anyone as she refilled the bowl with cabbage soup .
now , after his disillusion with the work on his estate , Levin was especially pleased to stay a while with Sviyazhsky .
Levin sat beside the hostess at the tea table , and was obliged to converse with her and her sister , who was sitting opposite him .
this landowner with the grey moustache was evidently an inveterate believer in serfdom , and a passionate farmer who had lived long in the country .
'But we see you don 't give it up , ' said Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky , ' so it seems it has its advantages . '
they are starving , yet if you hire one of them as a labourer , he 'll spoil and break things , and will even lodge complaints with the magistrate . '
Levin , who had long been acquainted with these patriarchal methods , exchanged a glance with Sviyazhsky , and , interrupting Michael Petrovich , addressed the landowner with the grey moustache .
'Why , carry on the way Michael Petrovich does : either pay the peasants in kind , or rent it to them ! that is quite possible , but the wealth of the community as a whole is ruined by such methods .
where my land used to yield ninefold under serfdom with good management , it only now yields threefold when the labourers are paid in kind .
Sviyazhsky looked at Levin with smiling eyes , and even made a just perceptible sarcastic sign to him ridiculing the old man , but Levin did not consider the landowner 's words ridiculous , he understood him better than he did Sviyazhsky .
'the fact that our agriculture is sinking , that it is impossible , our relation to the peasants being what it is , to carry on our rational farming profitably , is quite true . '
'Italian bookkeeping ! ' said the landowner scornfully . ' keep your accounts as you will - if they spoil everything you have got , you won 't have a profit ! '
'Yes , that is quite true , ' said the landowner with the grey moustache , and he even laughed with pleasure .
'And I am not the only one , ' continued Levin . ' I can refer you to many farmers who carry on rational farming , and with rare exceptions they all make a loss on it .
the landowner smiled when the profits of Sviyazhsky 's farming were mentioned , evidently aware of the sort of profits that his neighbour the Marshal of the Nobility was able to make .
'This year the raspberries are lasting an extraordinarily long time , ' and Sviyazhsky got up cheerfully and moved away , evidently regarding the conversation as finished at the very point where to Levin it seemed to be just beginning .
then there is a whole gigantic literature on the labour question , with the most Liberal Lassalle tendency ...
I am , of course , not a professor of Sociology , but it interests me , and really if it interests you , you had better study the matter . '
'What is it you are looking at ? ' he asked Levin , who , having stopped at the round table , was looking at one of the journals .
it was interesting that ' it turns out , ' and he did not consider it necessary to explain why it interested him .
'Yes , and I was greatly interested by that cross old landowner , ' said Levin with a sigh . ' he is intelligent and said much that is true . '
and in what way knowing how to add and subtract and to say the catechism will help them to improve their material condition , I never could understand !
she replied that she had been to see the " wise woman " because her boy was fractious , and she took him to be cured .
'Oh , not at all ! ' said Levin , crossly . ' that treatment seems to me just a parallel to treating the peasants by means of schools .
not one of the talks he had had with Sviyazhsky , though much that was clever had been said by the latter , interested him , but the landowner 's arguments required consideration .
let us consider the labourer not as an abstract labour force but as a Russian peasant with his own instincts , and let us arrange our farming accordingly .
one of the chief difficulties was that the farming was actually going on and it was impossible to stop it all and start afresh ; so that the machine had to be altered while it was working .
it was true that Theodore Rezunw 's group did not plough the corn land twice with the English plough as they had agreed to do , pleading lack of time .
these affairs added to the rest of the farming which remained on his hands , and the indoor work on his book , so filled Levin 's whole summer that he hardly ever made time to go out shooting .
he had treated the Sviyazhskys just as badly , having left their house without saying good @-@ bye .
often , just as he was beginning to understand the idea in his interlocutor 's mind and to explain his own , he would suddenly be asked : and what about Kauffmann and Jones , and Dubois and Michelli ? '
but rain set in , making it impossible to get in what remained of the corn and potatoes , stopped all the work , and even prevented the delivery of the wheat .
the mud made the roads impassable : two mills had been carried away by floods , and the weather was getting worse and worse .
on the thirtieth of September the sun showed itself in the morning , and , in hopes of fine weather , Levin began seriously preparing for his departure .
his conversation with the peasants of the outlying village showed that they were beginning to get used to the new conditions .
an old inn @-@ keeper , into whose house he had gone to dry himself , evidently approved of Levin 's plan and had offered to join a group to buy cattle .
the whole system of farming , and above all the position of the people , must be completely altered : instead of poverty - wealth and satisfaction for all ; instead of hostility - concord and a bond of common interest .
having dined , Levin as usual sat down in his easy @-@ chair with a book , and while reading continued to think about his impending journey in connection with the book he was writing .
to @-@ day the importance of his work presented itself to him with especial clearness , and whole paragraphs of their own accord shaped themselves in his mind , expressing the gist of his thoughts .
he rose to go to his writing @-@ table , and Laska , who was lying at his feet , stretched herself , also got up , and looked round at him as if asking where she was to go to .
but he had no time to write his thoughts down , for the labourers ' foremen had come , and Levin went into the hall to speak to them .
Laska lay down under the table , and Agatha Mikhaylovna with her knitting sat down in her usual place .
if he has a conscience he will work , if not , you can do nothing with him . '
but Levin overtook her . his work was not getting on now and he was glad of a visitor , whoever it might be .
under the sway of the thoughts that had come to him and of Agatha Mikhaylovna 's reminders , he was in an unsettled and confused state of mind and the forthcoming meeting with his brother seemed particularly distressing .
he was still more terrified when , kissing his brother 's face , his lips felt the dryness of the skin and he saw his large strangely brilliant eyes close at hand .
in spite of the fact that he was more round @-@ shouldered than ever and that , being so tall , his leanness was startling , his movements were quick and sudden as formerly .
but neither of them dared speak of it , and not having expressed the one thing that occupied their thoughts , whatever they said rang false .
and that Death which was present in this dear brother ( who , waking up , moaned and by habit called indiscriminately on God and on the devil ) was not so far away as it had hitherto seemed to be .
but what that inevitable Death was , he not only did not know , not only had never considered , but could not and dared not consider .
he lit a candle , got up carefully , went to the looking @-@ glass , and began examining his face and hair .
Levin HAD LONG AGO noticed that after people have made one uncomfortable by their pliancy and submissiveness they soon become unbearably exacting and aggressive .
on the third day of his stay Nicholas challenged his brother to explain his plans to him once more , and not only found fault with them but purposely confused them with communism .
'But I have been , and now I think it is premature but reasonable , and that it has a future as Christianity had in the first centuries . '
there used to be slaves everywhere , then villeins ; and we have labour paid in kind , and leaseholders , and hired labour : so what are you looking for ? '
'You do not want to establish anything . you simply want to be original , as you always have done , and to show that you are not just exploiting the peasants , but have ideas ! '
however much Levin tried afterwards to pacify his brother , Nicholas would not listen to it , but said that it was much better for them to part . and Levin saw that life had become simply intolerable for his brother .
Nicholas had quite made up his mind to go . Constantine came to him again and in an unnatural manner asked his forgiveness if he had offended him in any way .
Karenin made it a rule to see his wife every day , so as not to give the servants any grounds for making conjectures , but he avoided dining at home .
he had been chosen to act as guide to a foreign Prince , and was obliged to show him the sights of Petersburg .
in the mornings they went sight @-@ seeing , and in the evenings took part in the national amusements .
in Switzerland he had shot a chamois , in England he had jumped hedges in a pink coat and shot two hundred pheasants for a bet .
he had been in a harem in Turkey , ridden an elephant in India , and now in Russia he wanted a taste of distinctive Russian amusements .
but , on the whole , of all the Russian amusements the Prince liked the French actresses , a ballet girl , and white @-@ seal champagne best .
he was obliged to be on his guard the whole time not to deviate from the path of severe official respect , for fear of being insulted .
Vronsky was the same , and considered it very meritorious to be so , but in his relations with the Prince he was the inferior and felt indignant with that condescendingly good @-@ natured treatment .
he had that winter been promoted to the rank of colonel , had left the regiment , and was living alone .
he rang for his valet , dressed hurriedly , and went out into the porch , having quite forgotten his dream and feeling worried only by the fact that he was late .
as he drove up to the Karenins ' porch he again glanced at his watch and saw that it was ten minutes to nine .
the door opened and the hall porter with a rug over his arm called to the coachman .
the gaslight lit up Karenin 's worn , bloodless face beneath the black hat , and his white tie showing from beneath the beaver collar of his overcoat .
Vronsky saw him get into the carriage without looking round , take the rug and a pair of opera @-@ glasses through the carriage window ; then he disappeared in the darkness .
while still in the hall he heard her retreating footsteps , and knew that she had been waiting and listening for him , but had now gone back to the drawing @-@ room .
he looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had plucked , in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it .
they spoke of jealousy as ' the demon . ' ' yes , what had you begun telling me about the Prince ?
'i don 't take his part , and it is a matter of complete indifference to me , but I should say that as you did not like these pleasures you might have declined to go .
she drew up her face , half closed her eyes and quickly changed the expression of her face , folding her hands ; and Vronsky saw at once upon her beautiful face the very look with which Karenin had bowed to him .
soon , very soon , everything will get disentangled and we shall be able to rest and not torment each other any more . '
'You call it cruelty when a husband gives his wife complete freedom while he affords her honourable shelter , on the one condition that she should observe the laws of propriety .
since you wish to use that word - it is baseness to abandon a husband and a son for a lover and to go on eating the husband 's bread ! '
she did not say what she had said to her lover the day before , that Vronsky was her real husband and that he ( Karenin ) was superfluous , she did not even think it .
" yes , I have even lost my affection for my son , because he is connected with my repulsion for you . but all the same I shall take him away .
one of the clerks , without rising from his chair , screwed up his eyes and addressed Karenin ill @-@ humouredly .
his face was intelligent and peasant @-@ like , but his dress was dandified and in bad taste .
I wish for a divorce , but the form in which it can be obtained is of importance to me .
and on Karenin 's nodding affirmatively the lawyer continued , only occasionally casting a glance at Karenin 's face , which had grown red in patches .
'Divorce , under our laws , ' he said , with a slight shade of disapproval of the laws , ' as you are aware , may be granted in the following cases ...
I should not venture so to express myself were I talking to a man of undeveloped mind , ' said the lawyer , ' but I expect it is comprehensible to you . '
'If it is so ... ' Karenin began , growing suddenly pale ; but at that moment the other suddenly rose and went to the door to speak to his assistant , who had again come to interrupt him .
Karenin HAD gained a brilliant victory at the Committee Meeting of the seventeenth of August ; but the consequence of that victory undermined his power .
the subject @-@ races ' conditions had been investigated from the political , administrative , economic , ethnographical , material , and religious points of view .
'i consider it very fine of him , ' the Princess Betsy said , referring to it in a conversation with Princess Myagkaya . ' why should they pay for post @-@ horses when everybody knows that we now have railways everywhere ? '
'It is all very well for you to talk who possess I don 't know how many millions , ' she said . ' but I am very glad when my husband goes on inspection @-@ tours in summer .
it is very good for his health , and pleasant for him ; and we have an arrangement by which this allowance goes for the hire of a carriage and coachman for me . '
Karenin unfolded the rug he had wrapped round his legs , which were so sensitive to the cold , got out of the carriage , and making his way through the snow approached Dolly .
'Never mind ! tell them I will pay ! ' and nodding his head to an acquaintance who was driving past he disappeared round the corner .
having explained that he could not be there at the beginning of the performance , he promised to come for the last act , and take her to supper .
will you show me the way ? and please find out whether Count Anichkin ' ( the new superior ) ' will receive me . '
'no , I have no time . I 've only come in for a moment , ' replied Oblonsky , throwing open his coat .
'Well , what of that ? I never stop thinking of death , ' said Levin .
I consider my ideas very important , yet they too turn out to be insignificant - and would be , even if it were as possible to carry them out as it was to surround this bear .
his instinct had not deceived him ; the dreadful new superior turned out to be a most affable man . Oblonsky had lunch with him and sat talking so long that it was going on for four when he arrived at Karenin 's .
she cares for Anna as for a sister , she is fond of you , and she is a wonderful woman .
as he put on his overcoat while walking away , his arm struck the servant 's head . he laughed and went out .
young Shcherbatsky , who had not been introduced to Karenin , tried to look as if this did not make him feel at all awkward .
having patted Turovtsyn on the shoulder , he whispered something funny in his ear and got him to sit down next to Dolly and the old Prince .
in a moment he had kneaded all that Society dough in such a way that the drawing @-@ room was in first @-@ rate form , and was filled with animated voices .
in the depths of his soul he had felt sure that he should meet her that evening , but to maintain his freedom of thought he had tried to assure himself that he did not know it .
'We spent three hours together in a railway carriage , ' said Levin with a smile , ' but we parted filled with curiosity , as people do after a masquerade , at any rate I did . '
they stood round the scented vodka and the delicacies , and the conversation about the Russification of Poland between Koznyshev , Karenin , and Pestsov gradually slackened in the expectation of dinner .
Koznyshev , who knew better than anyone how at the end of a most abstract and serious dispute unexpectedly to administer a grain of Attic salt and thereby to change his interlocutor 's frame of mind , did so now .
'the rights of passengers to a choice of seats are very ill @-@ defined , ' said Karenin , wiping the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief .
'i noticed that you were not quite sure what to make of me , ' said Levin with a good @-@ natured smile , ' so I hastened to start an intellectual conversation , to expiate my sheep @-@ skin . '
the soup , Marie Louise , had succeeded to perfection , the tiny pasties melted in one 's mouth and were flawless .
the dinner was a success on the material side , and no less so on the non @-@ material side .
Pestsov LIKED TO BRING HIS discussions TO A FINISH , and had not been satisfied with Koznyshev 's remark , especially as he felt the fallacy of his own opinion .
we see that the Rhine has become Frenchified , yet the Germans do not stand on a lower level ! ' he shouted . ' there is some other law ! '
everybody laughed at Koznyshev 's ' pills , ' and Turovtsyn , who had at last heard the something funny for which he had been waiting as he listened to the conversation , laughed particularly loudly and merrily .
hardly had Koznyshev with his joke put an end to the discussion of one question before Pestsov immediately raised another .
Karenin expressed the view that the higher education of women is generally confounded with the question of women 's emancipation , and that was the only reason for considering it injurious .
'Oh yes , an Englishman on board ship did once nurse his baby , ' said the old Prince , allowing himself this indelicacy in his daughters ' presence .
'i really don 't remember . ' ' how pleasantly Turovtsyn laughs ! ' said Levin , looking with pleasure at his moist eyes and shaking body .
'Yes ? it was wonderful ! he is splendid ! ' said Dolly , looking toward Turovtsyn who felt that he was being talked about , and giving him a gentle smile .
the inequality between husband and wife , in his opinion , lay in the fact that the infidelity of a wife and that of a husband were unequally punished both by law and by public opinion .
as one always seems to knock a sore place , so that day Oblonsky felt that unfortunately the conversation kept striking Karenin 's sore place .
'i am so glad you came , ' said Dolly with a frightened smile , as she met him in the sitting @-@ room through which he had to pass : ' I must speak with you .
she rose quickly , put her hand on Karenin 's sleeve and said , ' We shall be disturbed here , come this way , please . '
Karenin smiled coldly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lacerated his wound .
and here I am living ; my children growing , my husband returns to the family and feels his error , grows purer and better , and I live ...
the conversation had turned to the question of village communes , in which Pestsov saw some special principle which he called the ' chorus principle . '
Levin did not agree either with Pestsov or with his brother Sergius , who , in a way of his own , both admitted and did not admit the importance of the Russian Communal System .
'Yes , you are quite right , ' said Levin , ' for the most part , people argue so warmly only because they CANNOT make out what it is that their opponent wants to prove . '
'i see : one must find out what one 's opponent is contending for , what he likes , and then one can ... '
Shcherbatsky left them , and Kitty went up to a table prepared for cards , sat down , took a piece of chalk , and began drawing concentric circles on the new green cloth of the table .
he supported this view by saying that no family can dispense with a help , and that in every family , rich or poor , there are and must be nurses , either paid or belonging to the family .
'Playing " secretary " ? ' said the old Prince approaching them . ' come now , we must be going , if you mean to come to the theatre . '
everything had been said in that conversation . she had said that she loved him , and would tell her father and mother , and he had said that he would call in the morning .
Egor , the attendant , of whom Levin had taken no notice heretofore , turned out to be a very intelligent , good , and above all very kind man .
it turned out that Egor had a family , three boys and a girl who was a seamstress and whom he wanted to marry to an assistant in a harness business .
after a long round , through the Gazetny Street and the Kislovka , he returned to the hotel , put his watch in front of him , and sat down waiting till it should be twelve .
in the next room they were saying something about machines and fraud , and coughing as people do of a morning .
trying not to offend the others , and promising to let them too drive him later on he hired one and told him to drive to the Shcherbatskys ' .
the izvoshchik knew the Shcherbatskys ' house , and rounding his elbows in a manner specially respectful to his fare called ' Whoa ! ' and stopped at the porch .
the footman was young , of the new @-@ fashioned kind , and a dandy , but a very kind and good fellow , and he too understood it all .
he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that was waiting for his kiss .
she had prepared herself to meet him alone , and had rejoiced at the idea , yet had felt timid and bashful and had not known what she would do .
'Well , you see , I don 't know at all ; I only expressed my wish , ' he said , to excuse himself .
the Princess went up to her husband , kissed him and was about to go away , but he stopped her , embraced her , and tenderly , like a young lover , kissed her several times , with a smile .
the old couple seemed to have become confused for the moment , and not to know whether it was they who were again in love or only their daughter .
he had now mastered himself and was able to speak , and there was much he had to say to her ; but what he said was not at all what he had intended .
'i am very pleased indeed , ' said Sviyazhsky , ' I advise you to go to Fomin 's for the flowers . ' -
she was religious and had never doubted the truth of her religion , but the lack of external religion in him did not affect her at all .
how was it they did not see that by giving him that post they were ruining themselves and their own prestige ?
it was from his wife , and Anna , written in blue pencil , was the first word he saw . ' I am dying .
as he entered the hall Karenin dragged forth his resolve as it were from a remote corner of his brain , and conned it over . it said :
there was no one in the drawing @-@ room , but the midwife , with lilac ribbons in her cap , came out of Anna 's boudoir .
'Be quick and bring the ice ! ' came the authoritative sound of the doctor 's voice from the bedroom .
beside the table , sitting with his side toward the back of a low chair , was Vronsky , his hands covering his face , weeping .
I am in a hurry , because I have no time . I have not long to live , I shall soon become feverish and then I shall no longer understand anything .
but there is another in me as well , and I am afraid of her . she fell in love with that other one , and I wished to hate you but could not forget her who was before .
she put her arm round his bald head , moved closer to him , and looked up with an expression of proud defiance .
how badly those flowers are drawn , not a bit like violets , ' and she pointed to the wallpaper .
toward morning she had become excited and animated , and her thoughts and words flowed rapidly ; but again this state lapsed into unconsciousness .
Vronsky got up at once , and stooping before him looked up into his face without unbending his back .
but most terrible of all was the ridiculous , shameful figure he had cut when Karenin was pulling his hands from before his shame @-@ suffused face .
but with his eyes closed he could see yet more distinctly Anna 's face , as he had seen it on that memorable evening before the race .
again , following each other with great rapidity , his happiest moments rose in his fancy ; and with them his recent humiliation .
going up to a door he closed it , then with fixed gaze and tightly clenched teeth , approached the table , took up his revolver , examined it , turned it to a loaded chamber , and pondered .
for a minute or two he stood motionless with bowed head , a strained expression of effort on his face , holding the revolver in his hand .
they were the same memories of happiness lost for ever , the same thoughts of the senselessness of all that life had in store for him , and the same consciousness of his humiliation .
he did not hear the sound of a shot , but a powerful blow on the chest knocked him off his feet .
he wished to steady himself by the table , dropped the revolver , reeled , and sat down on the floor , looking about him in astonishment .
but as time went on he saw more and more clearly that , however natural his position might appear to him at the time , he would not be allowed to remain in it .
Karenin had been in the nursery that morning , and having given orders to send for the doctor , had gone to the Department .
he noticed in all these acquaintances a kind of joy , which they suppressed with difficulty , like the joy he had noticed in the lawyer 's eyes and again just now in the footman 's .
an English nursery governess , who since Anna 's illness had replaced the French governess with the boy , sat doing some crochet @-@ work . she hurriedly rose , curtseyed , and nudged Serezha .
stepping on the soft carpet , as he approached the door he involuntarily overheard a conversation which he had no wish to hear .
'Yes , but you can 't but wish to say good @-@ bye to a man who tried to shoot himself for your sake ... '
'But your face looks feverish , ' said he , emphasizing the word feverish .
she was agitatedly toying with the tassels of her dressing @-@ gown , glancing at him with that tormenting feeling of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself , but which she could not overcome .
before Betsy HAD PASSED OUT of the dining @-@ room Oblonsky , who had just come from Eliseyev 's , where newly @-@ arrived oysters were to be had , met her in the doorway .
there is nothing for which I am more thankful than for the revival of the old custom of hand @-@ kissing , ' and he kissed Betsy 's hand : ' when shall I see you again ? '
'He will kill her , ' said Betsy in a significant whisper . ' this is impossible , impossible ... '
one of two things must happen : either he must take her away , acting energetically - or he must divorce her .
I was unhappy and thought it impossible to be more so ; but I could never have imagined such a terrible position as I am now in . will you believe it ?
knowing that he is a kind and generous man - that I am not worth his little finger - nevertheless I hate him !
again he smiled his almond @-@ oil smile . ' I will begin at the beginning : you married a man twenty years older than yourself .
Karenin smiled sadly , looked at his brother @-@ in @-@ law , and without replying went to the table and took from it an unfinished letter which he handed to him .
hard as it was for me to assure myself of this , I see that it is so , and there is no help for it .
that silence was so disconcerting to both that Oblonsky 's lips twitched painfully as he silently and fixedly gazed at Karenin 's face .
if she reads this letter she will not have the strength to say anything - she will only hang her head lower than ever . '
and this new relation can only be established when both are free . '
to leave him with his mother was not possible ; the divorced mother would have another , an illegitimate family , in which the position and education of a stepson would in all probability be a bad one .
but besides all this , what made divorce seem to Karenin more impossible than any other course was that by consenting to it he would by that very act ruin Anna .
however , do as you like ! ' and turning away so that his brother @-@ in @-@ law should not see his face , he sat down on a chair by the window .
it was very bitter , and he felt ashamed ; yet mixed with the bitterness and the shame he felt a sense of joy and emotion at the greatness of his own humility .
'It is a fatal disaster and has to be faced . I regard this disaster as an accomplished fact and am trying to help both you and her , ' Oblonsky went on .
to his contentment was added an idea that had just occurred to him . when the affair was all settled he would ask his wife and intimate friends a riddle : ' what is the difference between me and a chemist ? '
answer : ' a chemist makes solutions which do not make anyone happy , but I have made a dissolution and made three people happy ! '
he found he could look people in the face once more , and he was able to live in accord with his former habits .
the one thing he could not tear out of his heart , although he continually struggled against it , was a regret bordering on despair at having lost Anna for ever .
it was with this message that Betsy went to Anna , and she brought him an answer in the negative .
'So much the better , ' thought Vronsky when he heard it . ' it would have been a weakness - would have taken away all the strength I have left . '
to refuse the flattering offer of a post at Tashkend , which was a dangerous one , would have seemed disgraceful and impossible according to Vronsky 's former views .
consequently , having decided to divide her daughter 's trousseau into two parts , a lesser and a larger , the Princess eventually consented to have the wedding before Advent .
this plan would be all the more convenient because the young couple intended immediately after the wedding to go to the country , where the larger part of the trousseau would not be required .
to him , as an agnostic who yet respected the religious beliefs of others , it was always very trying to be present at , or to take part in , any religious ceremony .
now , in his state of triumph at the flowering time of his life , he was to be obliged to lie or blaspheme !
but question Oblonsky as he would , as to whether he could not obtain a certificate without going to communion , Oblonsky declared that he must go through with it .
standing in church during the first service he attended , Levin tried to revive the memories of his youth and the strong religious feeling with which at the age of sixteen or seventeen he had been imbued .
no one else was in the church except a soldier @-@ beggar , two old women , and the clergy .
the young deacon , the two halves of his long back clearly distinguishable through his thin under @-@ cassock , met him , and going at once to a small table beside the wall , began reading the prayers .
the latter , an old man with a thin grizzled beard and kind , weary eyes , stood beside the lectern turning over the leaves of a Missal .
there are hosts of aspirants who aim at mixing those two professions but I am not one of them ! '
'This custom of taking leave of celibacy is not without its reason , ' said Sergius Ivanich . ' however happy you may be , you can 't help regretting your freedom . '
'of course he feels so , but won 't own up , ' said Katavasov , and burst out laughing .
'ah , but your soul is in such chaos at the present moment that you are unable to find anything there ! wait till you 've settled down a bit , then you 'll find it , ' said Katavasov .
'no , I should even now have some consciousness that despite my feelings ' ( he did not wish in Katavasov 's presence to use the word love ) ' and my happiness I was yet sorry to lose my freedom .
a hopeless case ! ' said Katavasov . ' well , let us drink to his recovery , or let us wish that at least a hundredth part of his dreams come true .
when he was alone , Levin , thinking over the remarks of the three bachelors , once more asked himself whether there was in his soul any of that regret for his freedom that they had been speaking about .
'But do I know her thoughts , wishes , or feelings ? ' a voice suddenly whispered .
'no , this won 't do ! ' he said to himself despairingly . ' I will go to her and tell her for the last time that we are now free , and that perhaps we had better keep so !
I will call you , ' said Kitty . ' what is the matter with you ? ' she asked as soon as the maid was gone .
'She has scarcely eaten anything all these days and has grown quite plain ; and here you come and upset her with your nonsense ! ' said she . ' be off , be off , my dear ! '
one thing was certain : there was no time to be lost , for it was already half @-@ past six .
'Then this is what we must do : you go and fetch him in our carriage , and Sergius Ivanich , if he will be so kind , will go first and will send the carriage back . '
those who had arrived too late to get into the middle of the throng pressed round the windows , pushing and disputing and trying to peer in between the bars .
a police @-@ officer , unmindful of the frost , stood at the entrance looking brilliant in his blue uniform .
more carriages kept driving up , and now ladies with flowers in their hair got out , holding up their trains ; or men appeared who doffed their military caps or black hats as they entered the church .
every time the door creaked every one turned round , expecting to see the bride and bridegroom enter .
at length the delay became awkward , and the friends and relatives tried to look as if they were not thinking about the bride and bridegroom but were absorbed in their conversations .
the priest continually sent a chanter or deacon to see whether the bridegroom had arrived , and he himself , in his purple surplice with the embroidered girdle , went with increasing frequency to the side door in expectation of the bridegroom .
but in the corridor there was nobody , and in despair he returned and addressed Oblonsky , who was quietly smoking .
the fact of the matter was that when Levin told his old servant Kuzma to get his things ready , Kuzma had duly brought his dress coat , waistcoat and what else he considered necessary .
three minutes later Levin , not looking at the clock to avoid upsetting himself still more , ran as fast as he could down the corridor .
'It was such a stupid thing that happened ! I am ashamed to tell it , ' he said with a blush , and was obliged to turn round to the approaching Sergius Ivanich .
'Kitty , mind you step first upon the mat ! ' said Countess Nordston , coming up to them . ' you are a fine fellow ! ' she added , addressing Levin .
wait a moment , put your head down , ' said Kitty 's sister , Princess Lvova , and raising her plump , beautiful arms she adjusted the flowers on Kitty 's head .
the handsome , tall senior deacon in a silver cloth ALB , his curled hair parted down the middle , came briskly forward lifting his stole with a practised movement of two fingers , and stopped opposite the priest .
'Bless us , Lord ! ' slowly succeeding one another , and vibratingly resonant , came the solemn tones .
then , harmoniously filling the whole church from windows to vaulted roof , a full chord sung by the invisible choir rose , swelled , hung for a moment , and softly died away .
there were prayers as usual for the world above , for salvation , for the Synod , for the Emperor , and also for the servants of God that day wedded , Constantine and Catherine .
'Let us pray to the Lord that He may send them perfect love , peace , and help ! ' the whole church seemed to breathe with the senior deacon 's voice .
it was a feeling of joy at the fruition of what had been for the last month and a half going on in her soul , of that which for those six weeks had gladdened and tortured her .
again turning to the reading @-@ desk the priest with some difficulty picked up Kitty 's little ring , and asking Levin for his hand put the ring on the tip of his finger .
I was married in the evening too , ' answered Mrs. Korsunskaya , and sighed as she remembered how sweet she had looked that day , how funnily enamoured her husband then was , and how different things were now .
she was looking at Kitty and thinking of the time when she would be standing there beside Count Sinyavin , just as Kitty now stood , and how she would then remind him of his joke .
young Shcherbatsky told the old Maid of Honour Nikolayeva that he intended to put the crown on Kitty 's chignon , to make her happy .
'no , I like him very much , and not just because he will be my brother @-@ in @-@ law , ' answered the Princess . ' how well he behaves !
after the usual questions of whether they wished to be married and whether they had promised themselves to others , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves , the second part of the service began .
Kitty listened to the words of the prayer , trying to comprehend their meaning but unable to do so .
they prayed : ' that they may live in chastity for the good of the fruits of the womb , and find joy in their sons and daughters . '
'Put it quite on ! ' came the words of advice when the priest had put crowns on their heads and Shcherbatsky , his hand in its three @-@ buttoned glove trembling , held the crown high above Kitty 's head .
with light hearts they heard the Epistle read and the roll of the senior deacon 's voice in the last verse , for which the outsiders present had been waiting impatiently .
the spark of joy that was glowing in Kitty 's heart seemed to have spread to every one in the church .
having lifted the crowns from their heads , the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the married couple .
the priest helped him out of the difficulty , saying softly , with a smile on his kindly mouth , ' Kiss your wife ; and you , kiss your husband ! ' he took the candles from their hands .
he could not believe it was all true and only realized it when their surprised and timid glances met and he felt that they were already one .
Vronsky took off his soft , broad @-@ brimmed hat and wiped his perspiring forehead and his hair , which he had allowed to grow half @-@ way down his ears and wore brushed back so as to hide his bald patch .
after an absent @-@ minded glance at the man who was still standing there watching him , he was about to go in .
they pretended to understand completely the significance and meaning of the situation , to countenance and even approve of it , but to consider it out of place and unnecessary to explain all this .
from her look Vronsky understood that she did not yet know what attitude he wished to adopt toward Golenishchev , and was afraid she might not have behaved suitably .
yet Vronsky was surprised at , and sorry to see , the irritable excitement with which Golenishchev spoke on the subject that interested him .
remembering him as a thin , active , good @-@ natured , and noble boy , always at the head of his class , Vronsky could not understand the cause of the agitation , nor approve of it .
after trying several topics of conversation she led him on to the subject of art , about which he talked very well , and listened to him with attention .
'i am very pleased about one thing , ' said Anna to Golenishchev when they had returned to the hotel . ' Alexis will have a nice studio .
'Yes , I went in for it long ago , and now have begun a little , ' answered Vronsky with a blush .
during THIS , THE FIRST PERIOD of her freedom and rapid recovery , Anna was unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life .
the memory of the evil done to her husband aroused in her a feeling akin to repulsion , such as a man might feel who when in danger of drowning had shaken off another who clung to him .
that other was drowned ; of course it was wrong , but it had been the only way of escape and it was better not to recall such terrible details .
the desire to live , enhanced by her recovery , was so powerful , and the conditions of her life were so novel and pleasant , that Anna felt unpardonably happy .
to her it seemed that if he knew of it he would the sooner cease to love her , and there was nothing she now feared more - though she had no reason to do so - than the loss of his love .
he painted studies from nature under the direction of an Italian professor , and studied Italian life in the Middle Ages .
mediaeval Italian life had at that time become so fascinating to him that he even began to wear his hat and throw his cloak across his shoulder in a mediaeval manner which was very becoming to him .
you know , he is one of those heathenish new folk one so often meets nowadays ; you know ! one of those freethinkers who have been brought up from the beginning in disbelief , negation , and materialism .
but among us at the present day he tumbled straight into the literature of negation and rapidly assimilated the essence of the negative teaching , and there he was !
Golenishchev pulled himself up and unwillingly agreed , but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage .
at best you are only a fool , and when you begin arguing in Italian you become a treble fool ! ' he said at the end of a long dispute .
'What a duffer ! ' he muttered to himself as he seated himself at the table , and having opened a portfolio he at once set to work with particular ardour at an unfinished drawing .
now he was pleased and excited by the visit to his studio of these grand Russians who had come in a carriage .
'Come in , please ! ' he said , trying to put on an air of indifference , as he entered the hall and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door .
a mass of hair and a very open forehead gave a superficial significance to that face , which had an insignificant childish , restless expression concentrated in the narrow bridge of the nose .
'There ! ' he said , stepping aside with his loose gait , and pointing to the picture .
they would be in the right when they began to say falsely @-@ polite things in the presence of the artist , and to pity and laugh at him behind his back .
to break it and to appear calm , he made an effort and addressed Golenishchev .
one can so well understand that man , a kind , first @-@ rate fellow , but an official to his very backbone , who does not know what he is doing .
the fact that this opinion was but one of a million of other opinions which - as Mikhaylov well knew - would all have been just did not for him detract from the importance of Golenishchev 's remark .
in an instant his whole picture became alive before his eyes , with the inexpressible complexity of everything that lives .
he wished to say that it was just so that he understood Pilate , but his trembling lips would not obey him and he was unable to speak .
in Christ 's expression there should be pity because there was love in it , a peace not of this world , a readiness for death , and a knowledge of the vanity of words .
of course there was an official expression in Pilate 's face and pity in Christ 's , for the former was the embodiment of carnal and the latter of spiritual life .
one could walk round it , ' said Golenishchev , showing evidently by this remark that he did not approve of the content and idea of the figure .
he had often noticed - as now when his picture was being praised - that technique was contrasted with inner quality , as if it were possible to paint well something that was bad .
and the most experienced and technical painter could never paint anything by means of mechanical skill alone , if the outline of the subject @-@ matter did not first reveal itself to his mind .
and in almost all the figures and faces he saw traces of wrappings that had not been entirely removed and that spoilt the picture .
'It is , that you have made Him a man @-@ God , and not a God @-@ man .
your picture is so good that a remark of mine CANNOT do it any harm , besides which it 's only my personal opinion ... yours is different , the idea itself is different .
I consider that if Christ is to be brought down to the level of an historic figure , it would be better to choose another historic theme , a fresh one as yet untouched . '
yet Ivanov 's picture suggests both to a believer and an unbeliever the question : is this a God or not a God ? and the unity of impression is destroyed . '
he did not even like looking at it , and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wished to buy it .
while correcting the foot he kept glancing at the figure of John in the background , which the visitors had not even remarked , but which he knew to be the height of perfection .
when he had completed the foot he was about to do something to that figure , but felt that he was too agitated .
there was only one stage between calmness and inspiration , at which work was possible , and to @-@ day he was too excited .
they said that it was impossible to deny his talent , but that his talent could not develop because of his lack of education - the common misfortune of our Russian artists .
'How long have I been struggling without accomplishing anything ? ' he said , referring to the portrait he was painting ; ' and he just looked , and painted this !
Vronsky was more than polite to him , and was evidently interested in the artist 's opinion of his ( Vronsky 's ) picture .
when Vronsky talked about his art Mikhaylov remained stubbornly silent , and as stubbornly silent when they showed him Vronsky 's picture , and he was evidently oppressed by Golenishchev 's discourses , to which he made no rejoinder .
Golenishchev was the first to express the thought that was in all their minds , namely , that Mikhaylov was simply jealous of Vronsky .
Vronsky took Mikhaylov 's part , but in the depth of his heart he believed what Golenishchev said , for he considered that a man of that other and lower world must envy him .
he knew it was not possible to forbid Vronsky to trifle with art , knew that he and all the dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked - but to him it was unpleasant .
the same thing happened to him as to Golenishchev , who , feeling that he had nothing to express , continually deceived himself by saying that his thought had not yet ripened and that he was bringing it to maturity and preparing materials .
but Golenishchev was embittered and tormented by it , while Vronsky could not deceive and torment himself , and above all could not become embittered .
in Petersburg Vronsky planned to separate his property from his brother 's , and Anna to see her son .
far an instant he was offended , but immediately knew he could not be offended with her because she was himself .
his natural feelings prompted him to justify himself and prove that she was in the wrong ; but to prove her in the wrong would mean irritating her still more , and widening the breach which was the cause of all the trouble .
like a man half @-@ asleep and oppressed with pain , he wanted to tear off the aching part and cast it from him , but found on waking that the aching part was - himself .
only in the third month of their married life , after returning from Moscow where they had spent a month , did their life begin to run more smoothly .
many of his former thoughts now appeared superfluous and extreme , but many omissions became clear to him when he went over the matter afresh .
this is almost the first day that I have really set to work seriously and what has come of it ?
she takes no interest in our work , in the farm , in the peasants , or in music , though she is quite good at that , or in books .
he perceived that despite Agatha Mikhaylovna 's grief at the advent of the new mistress who had taken the reins of management into her own hands , Kitty had conquered and had made the old woman love her .
'And I say that if you go I shall go with you . I will certainly go ! ' she said hastily and angrily .
I know that my husband 's brother is dying , that my husband is going to him , and that I am going with my husband in order ... '
but just think , this matter is so important - it hurts me to think that you are mixing up with it your weakness , your dislike of remaining alone .
why , since you are repenting ? ' she said , and jumped up and ran into the drawing @-@ room .
he had expected to find him in that state of self @-@ deception which , he had heard , was frequent in consumptive cases and which had so struck him at the time of his brother 's visit to him in the autumn .
Levin at once felt the reproach in the look fixed on him , and a sense of repentance because of his own happiness .
Nicholas seemed pleased at this , but said he was afraid the condition he was in might frighten her .
taking advantage of the first moment of silence , Levin got up , wishing to free himself if only for a few minutes from his painful sensations , and said he would fetch his wife .
stepping lightly and glancing repeatedly at her husband , showing him a brave face full of sympathy she entered the sick @-@ room , and , turning without haste , noiselessly closed the door .
'You would not have known me again ? ' he asked , with a smile that had lit up his face at her entrance .
she had not finished speaking before that stern reproachful look of jealousy , felt by the dying for the living , settled on his face .
when he entered the sickroom his eyes and his attention became clouded without his being conscious of it , and he did not see or distinguish the various details of his brother 's condition .
she herself went several times to their own room and , without paying any attention to the people she met , brought back with her sheets , pillow @-@ cases , towels , and shirts .
he knew too that many great and virile minds , whose thoughts on that subject he had read , had pondered it , and yet did not know a hundredth part of what his wife and Agatha Mikhaylovna knew on the subject .
she ordered supper to be brought , unpacked their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprinkle insect powder on them .
it seemed to Levin that it would be inexcusable to eat , sleep , or even to talk , and he felt that his every movement was improper .
she , however , sorted combs and brushes , and did it all in such a way that there was nothing offensive about it .
'However , we have hard days before us - let us go to bed , ' said Kitty with a glance at her tiny watch .
in his large eyes , fixed upon an icon which had been placed on a little table covered with a coloured cloth , was a look of such passionate entreaty and hope that Levin was frightened at seeing it .
the invalid fell quietly asleep , but awoke half an hour later with a fit of coughing , and immediately every hope fled from those around him and from himself .
the reality of his sufferings destroyed it , leaving no trace nor even any recollection of the former hopes , in Levin , Kitty , or the patient himself .
for a long , a very long , time as it seemed to Levin the invalid lay motionless , but he still lived and at long intervals sighed .
to all questions of how he felt , he gave the same answer , with an angry and reproachful look : ' I am suffering terribly , intolerably ! '
it was all a lie : a repulsive , insulting , blasphemous lie ; and as a result of his character , and because he loved the dying man more than the others did , Levin felt that lie most painfully .
there was no position that did not cause him pain ; no moments of forgetfulness ; no part of his body that did not hurt and torment him .
his life was quite swallowed up in a consciousness of suffering and a desire to be released from it .
therefore all his desires were merged into one : a desire to be released from all this pain and from its source - his body .
having finished the prayer , the priest touched the cold forehead with his cross which he then wrapped in his stole , and after standing in silence another two minutes , touched the enormous bloodless hand , which was growing cold .
'He has passed away , ' said the priest and turned to go ; but suddenly the clammy moustache of the dying man moved and from the depth of his chest through the stillness came his voice , sharp and distinct :
the first two days after his wife 's departure Karenin received petitioners , and his private secretary , attended Committee Meetings , and went to the dining @-@ room to dinner as usual .
without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
their uncle , Karenin , a high official and at one time a favourite with the late Emperor , brought them up .
there was a fellow @-@ student at the university with whom he had subsequently become friendly , and to whom he might have spoken of his grief ; but that fellow @-@ student was now curator in a distant educational district .
the other person , the doctor , was also well @-@ inclined toward Karenin , but they had long ago come to a tacit understanding that they were both overwhelmed with work and had no time to spare .
'J 'ai forcé la consigne ! [ ' I 've forced my way in . ' ] she said as she entered with hurried steps , breathing heavily from her rapid movement and from excitement .
the Countess went to Serezha 's part of the house and there , watering the frightened boy 's cheeks with her tears , told him that his father was a saint and that his mother was dead .
the Countess Lydia Ivanovna when quite a young and ecstatic girl was married to a rich , aristocratic , very good @-@ natured , and most jovial profligate .
a young adjutant , a comrade of Vronsky 's , through whom she had her information , who hoped through her influence to obtain a concession , told her that they had finished their affairs and were leaving Petersburg next day .
I address myself to you , instead of to Alexis Alexandrovich , only because I do not wish to give pain to that high @-@ minded man by reminding him of myself .
everything in that letter irritated the Countess Lydia Ivanovna : its matter , the hint contained in the word ' magnanimity , ' and especially what seemed to her its free and easy tone .
meeting as they were going out , acquaintances chatted about the latest news , the newly awarded honours , and the changes among the highest officials .
soon after the parting with his wife he began writing a pamphlet on the new legal procedure , the first of an innumerable series of unwanted pamphlets on every administrative department which it was his fate to write .
Lydia Ivanovna 's dress had cost her a great deal of trouble , as was the case with all her attire of late .
as he now ran the gauntlet of those mocking eyes he was drawn toward her enamoured look as naturally as a plant is drawn toward the sun .
when Karenin entered the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's snug little boudoir , which was full of old china and had its walls covered with portraits ; the hostess was not yet there .
upon a round table covered with a cloth stood a Chinese tea service and a silver kettle over a spirit lamp .
Karenin glanced absent @-@ mindedly at the numberless familiar portraits decorating the boudoir , and sitting down by the table opened a New Testament that was on it .
granted that you have forgiven her , and do forgive her ; but have we the right to act thus toward the soul of that angel ?
'If you ask my advice , ' she said , when her prayer was ended and she uncovered her face , ' I do not advise you to do it !
the memory of the letter he had written to her also tormented him ; above all his forgiveness , which no one wanted , and his care for another man 's child , burned his heart with shame and regret .
and there rose before his mind 's eye a whole row of those vigorous , strong , self @-@ assured men , who had always involuntarily attracted his curiosity and attention .
'Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . '
Serezha had met him in the hall , and had heard him piteously begging the porter to announce him to Karenin , and saying that he and his children were face to face with death .
this joy appeared to him particularly important because it coincided with the satisfaction of the official , and his own happiness that a present had been brought .
in these reflections time passed until the teacher arrived . the lesson on the attributes of Time , Place , and Manner of Action had not been learnt .
Serezha jumped up , approached his father , kissed his hand , and looked at him attentively , trying to find some sign of his joy at receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky .
I am displeased with you , and Peter Ignatych ' - this was the chief educationalist - ' is also displeased with you ...
his father from his point of view considered that the boy did not try to learn what he was being taught .
you 'd better tell me , ' said Vasily Lukich , smiling , which he rarely did . ' well , lie down , and I 'll put out the candle . '
his mother and his sister @-@ in @-@ law received him just as usual , asked him about his trip abroad and spoke of mutual acquaintances , but did not say a single word about his union with Anna .
she , he thought , would cast no stones , but would simply and resolutely go and see Anna and receive her at her own house .
'But we must call things by their real names . you wish me to go and see her and to receive her , and so rehabilitate her in Society ; but please understand that I CANNOT do it !
at one moment she appeared to be in love with him , and at the next would turn cold , irritable , and impenetrable .
the nearer they came to Petersburg the greater its joy and importance appeared .
it was painful to her even to think of writing to and coming into contact with her husband : she could be calm only when she did not think of him .
next morning Anna went alone , and at eight o 'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home .
now he was not even as she had left him ; he was still further removed from the four @-@ year @-@ old child ; he had grown still more and had got thinner .
but still it was he : the slope of the head was his , the lips were his , the soft neck and the broad shoulders .
Korney , the valet , went down into the hall @-@ porter 's room to inquire who had let her in , and hearing that it was Kapitonich who had done so , he reprimanded the old man .
the hall @-@ porter remained obstinately silent ; but when the valet said he ' ought to get the sack , ' Kapitonich rushed at Korney and , flourishing his hands about before Korney 's face , began to speak out :
I 've been in service here ten years , and have had nothing but kindness : you had better go up and tell her , " You be off , please ! "
she was listening to the sound of his voice , saw his face and the play of his features , felt his hands , but did not understand what he was saying .
Serezha , with bright eyes and beaming smile , holding his mother with one hand and his nurse with the other , jumped with his plump bare feet on to the carpet .
she had not had time even to unwrap the toys she had chosen with so much love and sadness the day before , and she took them back with her .
'Yes , it is all ended and I am alone again , ' she said to herself ; and without taking off her bonnet she sat down in an easy @-@ chair by the fireplace .
Vronsky was examining her son 's photos , which she had forgotten on the table , and did not hurry to look at her .
but of course you don 't care for life abroad , ' she went on with a pleasant smile : ' I know you and know all your tastes , though we have met so seldom . '
'Then we shall not meet again ? ' said Yashvin , rising ; and then turning to Vronsky he asked , ' Where are you dining ? '
he decided that it was necessary to have an explanation with her , and he waited for her in the drawing @-@ room .
the Princess asked to be excused for not coming to say good @-@ bye ; she was not well , but asked Anna to come and see her between half @-@ past six and nine .
'i 'm sorry that between half @-@ past six and nine is just the time when I CANNOT come , ' she replied with a faint smile .
after dinner Tushkevich went to get a box and Yashvin to have a smoke . Vronsky went with Yashvin down to his own rooms , but after sitting with him a while , ran upstairs again .
he saw all the beauty of her face and of her dress , which suited her as her dresses always did .
Yashvin emptied another glass of brandy into the sparkling water , drank it , and then rose , buttoning his coat .
'With a wife one has trouble , but with one who is not a wife it 's worse , ' thought Yashvin as he left the hotel .
through a door slightly ajar came the sounds of a muffled staccato accompaniment by the orchestra and of a female voice rendering a musical phrase with precision .
the door was closed immediately and he did not hear the end of the phrase nor the trill after it , but knew from the thunder of applause behind the door that the trill was finished .
'How little of the military man is left in you ! ' remarked Serpukhovskoy . ' you might be a diplomatist , an artist , or anything of that kind . '
'Yes , as soon as I returned home I put on a black coat , ' Vronsky replied with a smile , slowly taking out his opera @-@ glasses .
I , when I come back from abroad and put this on again , regret my freedom , ' he said , touching his shoulder @-@ knot .
next to a lady wearing a Turban , and a bald old man who blinked angrily just as Vronsky 's moving glass reached him , he suddenly saw Anna 's proud head , strikingly beautiful , and smiling in its frame of lace .
the wife , a thin little woman , was standing up in her box with her back to Anna , putting on an opera @-@ cloak which her husband was holding for her .
Kartasov , a stout bald @-@ headed man , kept glancing round at Anna while trying to pacify his wife .
but Anna , with obvious intention , took no notice of him and , turning round , was saying something to Yashvin , whose cropped head was bent toward her .
having conducted the Princess Sorokina back to Vronsky 's mother , Varya held out her hand to her brother @-@ in @-@ law and at once began to talk of the matter that interested him .
'i have been expecting you all the time , ' said his mother with a sarcastic smile . ' I never see anything of you . '
Vronsky did not reply , and after a few words addressed to the Princess Sorokina he left the box .
he hurried downstairs feeling that he must do something , he knew not what .
when Vronsky entered she was still dressed as she had been at the theatre .
the house on her own estate was quite dilapidated , so Levin and his wife persuaded her to spend the summer with them .
and Kitty , who conducted her household with great assiduity , had no little trouble to procure all the chickens , turkeys , and ducks , of which , with the visitors ' and the children 's summer appetites very many were required .
Kitty stood near her husband , evidently waiting for the end of the conversation - which did not interest her - before speaking to him .
'Kate , it is not good for you to be standing , ' said her husband , with a meaning look , moving a chair toward her .
in advance of them all , at a sideways gallop , came Tanya in tightly pulled @-@ up stockings , running toward Koznyshev , flourishing a basket and his hat .
'i must look at the new waggons , and count them , ' said Levin . ' and where will you be ? '
'Steve says it 's better to give them money , ' Dolly remarked , returning to the interesting topic of what presents it was best to give to the servants , ' but ... '
'But don 't get excited ; there is no need at all for you to get excited , ' admonished her mother .
'Well ? ' he asked , looking at her with the expression with which every one addressed her nowadays .
'Well , Agatha Mikhaylovna , is the jam done ? ' asked Levin , smiling at her and wishing to cheer her up . ' has it turned out well the new way ? '
they had nothing to say to one another , but he wanted to hear the sound of her voice , which like her look had been changed by pregnancy .
'no , but he is so used to living a purely spiritual life that he CANNOT reconcile himself to realities , and , after all , Varenka is a reality ! '
'Oh no ! he is very fond of you , and it is always such a pleasure to me when my people are fond of you . '
'no . I feel it now more than ever - and it is your fault , ' he answered , pressing her arm , ' that it 's not the right thing .
'Well then , we won 't count this tiny one , ' said he , picking off a short ill @-@ formed petal . ' and here 's the trap overtaking us . '
'If it is so , I must think it over and come to a decision , and not let myself be carried away like a boy by the impulse of the moment , ' he told himself .
suddenly , from the skirts of the wood not far off , he heard Varenka 's contralto voice calling to Grisha , and a smile of pleasure lit up his face .
but it is nothing of the kind . the one thing I can find against it is that when I lost Marie I told myself that I would remain true to her memory .
she had all the charm and freshness of youth but was no longer a child , and if she loved him , loved him consciously as a woman ought to love . that was one favourable consideration .
I have lived many years , and now in you for the first time I have met what I was in search of .
'i have only heard that the white boleti grow chiefly on the outskirts , but I can 't even tell which are the white ones . '
she was frightened : frightened of what he might or might not say .
'What is it , Agatha Mikhaylovna ? ' Kitty asked suddenly when the old woman stopped in front of her with a look of mystery and importance .
even in the Levins ' well @-@ ordered household she found ways to be of use . ' I will see about supper , ' she said , ' and you stay here ' ; and she rose to accompany Agatha Mikhaylovna .
it must be Papa ! ' shouted Levin , who had stopped at the bend of the avenue . ' Kitty , don 't come down those steep steps , go round ! '
it was long since the farm work had seemed so important to him as it did that evening .
'Yes ! do let 's go ! ' cried Veslovsky , changing from one chair to another and sitting sideways with one of his fat legs doubled under him .
Levin remained at the other end of the table , and while not ceasing to talk with the Princess and Varenka saw that Oblonsky , Dolly , Kitty , and Veslovsky were carrying on an animated and mysterious conversation .
moreover , he saw his wife had an expression of serious feeling as she gazed attentively at Vasenka 's handsome face while he was vivaciously narrating something .
meanwhile Vasenka , without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing , rose from the table after Kitty and followed her , smiling pleasantly .
please let 's go ! ' said Vasenka , sitting down and once more doubling his leg under him , as his habit was .
'Come , Kostya , you are exaggerating ! ' remonstrated Kitty , at the bottom of her heart pleased by the force of love for her which was now expressing itself in his jealousy .
'the worst of it all is that you - are as you always are , and now when you are my holy of holies and we are so happy - so specially happy - suddenly this good @-@ for @-@ nothing comes along ...
'Well then , I will keep him here all the summer on purpose . I will lavish attentions on him , ' said Levin , kissing her hands .
at length the door opened noisily and out bounded , spinning round and round in the air , Krak , Oblonsky 's yellow spotted pointer , followed by Oblonsky himself with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth .
Vasenka had been ignorant that the stylishness of a real sportsman consists in being dressed in rags but having one 's shooting implements of the very best quality .
'Why , but three steps will add to its length as well ... Where will it get to ? '
when they had gone about three versts , Veslovsky suddenly missed his cigars and pocket @-@ book , and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on his table .
he had three hundred and seventy roubles in the pocket @-@ book , and therefore the matter could not be ignored .
so the coachman rode back on the side @-@ horse and Levin drove the other two himself .
Levin himself felt inclined to stop at those little places , but , as they were near home , they were always within his reach and they were small , so that there was not room enough for three persons to shoot there .
when they came to a small marsh he wished to drive past it , but Oblonsky , with the practised eye of a sport man , noticed the marshy place from the road .
suddenly the horses started , Levin knocked his head against the barrel of some one 's gun , and there was a report .
when they reached the second marsh , which was of considerable size and would take a good deal of time Levin tried to dissuade them from getting out .
Laska , who had long been whining plaintively , as if complaining of the injustice , rushed straight forward to a likely spot covered with hummocks and known to Levin , where Krak had not yet been .
when everything was in order and the vehicles had been brought back to the road , Levin gave orders for lunch to be served .
it 's a splendid marsh , and I see there are hawks too , ' said Oblonsky , pointing at two large birds circling above the sedges . ' where there are hawks , there is sure to be game . '
Levin knew Laska 's method of search - careful and dubious ; he knew it , and expected to see a flight of snipe .
Vasenka had fired into a flight of ducks that were circling above the marsh far out of range and were at that moment flying straight toward the sportsmen .
Levin had barely time to turn , before he heard the cry of a snipe , then another , and a third , and about eight more rose one after the other .
meanwhile from the opposite side of the marsh came not frequent but , as it seemed to Levin , significant reports from Oblonsky 's gun , followed almost every time by a cry to the dog , ' Krak ! Krak !
the cry near the ground and sound in the air came incessantly from every side . the snipe that had risen previously and had been flying about descended in front of the sportsmen .
though there was little hope of finding as many birds in the unmown strips as on the mown part , Levin , having promised Oblonsky to meet him , went with his companion farther on over the mown and unmown strips .
'Come along ! never mind ! ' shouted a merry , bearded , red @-@ faced peasant ; showing a row of white teeth and holding aloft a greenish vodka bottle that glittered in the sunshine .
I should go and have a drink , ' said Levin , not quite disinterestedly , hoping that the vodka would tempt Veslovsky and lure him away .
at last , after a disgraceful miss , he threw his gun , and hat on the ground .
Krak , quite black with smelly marsh slime , sprang out from beneath the upturned root of an alder with the air of a conqueror and sniffed at Laska .
do they keep vodka for sale ? ' said the soldier who had at last succeeded in dragging off one wet boot together with a blackened stocking .
after fluctuating between recollections and stories of the shooting , of dogs , and of other shooting parties , the talk reached a theme that interested all three .
'i don 't understand you , ' said Levin , rising on his heap of hay . ' how is it that those people don 't disgust you ?
'i don 't give it away because nobody demands that of me , and if I wanted to I could not do it , ' replied Levin ; ' besides , there is no one to give it to . '
'If only one could ... go without getting up ! ' said Oblonsky , stretching himself . ' it 's delightful to lie still . '
Venez vite ! ' [ gentlemen , come quickly . ] came the voice of Veslovsky , who had come back .
Levin pretended to be asleep , but Oblonsky , having put on his slippers and lit a cigar , left the barn , and their voices soon died away .
I am not manly with her , I have grown effeminate ...
only one of them was lazily eating oats , scattering them over the edge of the trough .
'Why have you risen so early , my dear ? ' said his aged hostess , who came out of her hut , addressing him cordially as a good old acquaintance .
one of her ears had turned back while she ran , she breathed heavily but cautiously , and yet more cautiously looked toward her master , turning her eyes rather than her head .
from here I scent them , but if I go forward I shall not know what I am doing , nor where they are nor who they are . '
but now he pushed her with his knee , saying in an excited whisper , ' Seize it , Laska ! seize it ! '
after flying some twenty feet , the second snipe rose at an acute angle , and then , turning round and round like a ball , fell heavily on a dry spot .
a hawk had woke up and was sitting on a haycock , turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh .
'He has an appetite ! ' said Oblonsky , laughing and pointing to Vasenka Veslovsky . ' I don 't suffer from lack of appetite , but he 's quite surprising ... '
'the beef has been eaten , and the bone was given to the dogs , ' answered Philip .
in the evening they again went out shooting , when Veslovsky also killed some birds , and late at night they set off home .
'We had fine sport , and so many new impressions ! ' said Veslovsky , approaching Kitty , who sat at the samovar . ' what a pity ladies are deprived of that pleasure . '
again , as on the previous occasion , he suddenly , without the least interval , felt thrown from the height of happiness , peace , and dignity into an abyss of despair , malevolence , and degradation .
Vasenka only rose for a moment , and with the absence of politeness to women which is characteristic of modern young men , barely bowed and again continued his conversation , laughing at something .
he did not look her in the face and did not notice that she ( in her condition ) stood with her whole face twitching , and had a pitiful , crushed appearance .
'the servants are there , in the pantry , ' he said angrily ; ' don 't make a scene . '
the little girl burst into sobs and buried her face in her mother 's lap , and Dolly placed her thin tender hand on the child 's head .
on the table lay a piece of stick which when doing gymnastics that morning they had broken , trying to raise the warped parallel bars .
Levin turned away from him quickly and went far down one of the avenues , where he continued walking up and down alone .
the road was good , the calèche comfortable , the horses ran merrily , and on the box beside the coachman instead of a footman sat an office clerk whom Levin sent with her for safety .
of course Steve is not to be counted on , but with the help of kind people I shall start them somehow ... But in case of another child ... '
this answer had seemed horrible to Dolly , despite the good @-@ natured sweetness of the young woman 's looks , but now she could not help recalling it .
Dolly shuddered at the mere thought of the pain she had endured from sore nipples , from which she had suffered with almost every baby .
even now , if we had not spent this summer with Kostya and Kitty , I don 't know how we should have managed .
all the faces turned toward her seemed to Dolly to be healthy and bright , mocking her with their joy in life .
the coachman STOPPED THE horses and looked round toward a field of rye on the right , where some peasants sat beside a cart .
the curly @-@ headed old man , with a piece of bast tied round his head , his rounded back dark with perspiration , increased his speed , approached the calèche and put his sunburnt arm on the mud @-@ guard .
'i tell you it 's just there , where you come out , ' and he went on rubbing his hand along the mud @-@ guard of the calèche .
'There , you see , when you 've turned to the left you 'll knock straight up against it , ' said the peasant , evidently unwilling to let them go , and wishing to talk .
it was Vronsky with his jockey , Veslovsky and Anna on horseback , and Princess Barbara with Sviyazhsky in the char @-@ a @-@ Banc .
'You can have no idea how pleased we are that you have come ; ' he said , putting peculiar emphasis into his words , while a smile exposed his strong white teeth .
Anna noticed Dolly 's expression , became confused , blushed , let her habit slip out of her hands , and stumbled over it .
but what struck her most was the change that had taken place in Anna , whom she knew and loved .
another woman less observant , who had not known Anna before , especially one who had not thought the thoughts that were in Dolly 's mind on the way , would not have noticed anything peculiar in Anna .
the clerk , to hide his embarrassment , bustled about , helping the ladies in , but Philip became morose and made up his mind not to be imposed upon by this eternal superiority .
Anna , turning her eyes away from her friend and screwing them up ( this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dolly ) , grew thoughtful , trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark .
'They are the employees ' houses , the stud farm , and the stables , ' answered Anna . ' and here the park begins .
he is very fond of this estate , and - a thing I never expected of him - he is quite enthusiastic in managing the place .
he has grown into a first @-@ rate , prudent landlord , as I recognize ; in farming matters he is even stingy , but only in farming .
the peasants asked him to let them some meadows at a reduced rent , I think , and he refused , and I reproached him with being stingy .
of course it was not that alone , but one thing with another caused him to start that hospital , to show , you know , that he is not stingy .
'How fine ! ' said Dolly , looking with involuntary surprise at a handsome house with a row of columns standing out among the variously tinted foliage of the old trees in the garden .
they drove into a gravelled courtyard surrounded by flowers , where two men were making a border of rough porous stones round a well @-@ forked flower @-@ bed and stopped beneath a roofed portico .
where is the Count ? ' she asked the two elegant footmen who had rushed out . ' Ah , there he is ! ' she went on , seeing Vronsky and Veslovsky coming out to meet her .
well , let 's go in , ' said Anna , who had given her favourite horse the sugar the footman had brought .
the bed had a spring and an overlay mattress , with a specially shaped bolster and small pillows with silk slips .
the marble washstand , the dressing @-@ table , the couch , the tables , the bronze clock on the mantelpiece , the curtains and door @-@ hangings were all costly and new .
the smart lady 's maid with hair stylishly done , and wearing a dress more fashionable than Dolly 's , who came to offer her services , was as new and expensive as everything else in the room .
at home it was clear that six jackets required twenty @-@ four arshins of nainsook at sixty @-@ five kopeks , which comes to more than fifteen roubles , besides the trimmings and the work ; and she had saved all that .
we wanted to send her back , but the child is so used to her that we are still keeping her . '
that is , her name is Karenina , ' said Anna , screwing up her eyes till only the meeting lashes could be seen . ' however , we will talk about all that later , ' said she , suddenly brightening .
here were perambulators ordered from England , an apparatus to teach a baby to walk , a specially constructed piece of furniture like a billiard @-@ table for the baby to crawl on , swings , and baths of a new special kind .
when they entered the little girl was sitting in her chemise in a little arm @-@ chair at a table , having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest .
would you believe it , I am just like a starving woman to whom a full meal has been served , and who does not know what to begin on first ?
then there 's the doctor , a young man , not exactly a nihilist , but - you know , eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor .
their conversation was interrupted by Anna , who had found the men in the billiard @-@ room and brought them back with her to the verandah .
'no , it 's too hot : better let 's walk through the garden and go for a row , to let Darya Alexandrovna see the banks , ' suggested Vronsky .
as is frequently the case with irreproachably moral women who become tired of the monotony of a moral life , she from a distance not only excused a guilty love but even envied it .
in particular it was disagreeable to her to see the Princess Barbara , who forgave them everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed there .
in general , in the abstract Dolly approved the step Anna had taken , but it was unpleasant to her to see the man for whose sake the step had been taken .
she experienced the same kind of shyness in his presence that she had felt when the lady 's maid saw her jacket .
and he began , at first with reserve but more and more carried away by his subject , to draw her attention to various details of the adornment of the house and garden .
one could see that , having devoted great pains to the improvement and decoration of his place , Vronsky felt compelled to boast of them to a fresh person , and was heartily pleased by Dolly 's praises .
beside the finished building another as yet surrounded by scaffolding was being built . workmen wearing aprons stood on the scaffolding laying bricks , pouring water from wooden pails , or smoothing the mortar .
'That will be the doctor 's quarters and the dispensary , ' replied Vronsky ; and seeing the architect in his short jacket coming toward them , he apologized to the ladies and went to meet him .
I see that Anna is happy , quite happy , she has already told me so , ' said Dolly smiling ; and involuntarily while saying it she doubted whether Anna was really happy .
'Well , this brings me to the point of my talk , ' he went on , calming himself with an effort . ' Anna can do it ; . it depends on her ...
even to be able to petition the Emperor for permission to adopt the child , a divorce will be necessary , and that depends on Anna .
and she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna screwed up her eyes .
the conversation passed on to the abuses in the government of the United States , but Anna quickly turned it to another theme so as to draw the steward out of his silence .
I saw one at the Vienna Exhibition that bound the sheaves with wire , ' remarked Sviyazhsky . ' that kind would be more profitable , '
'What a pity ! ' said Anna , and having thus paid the tribute of politeness to the retainers , she turned to her friends .
'Then we may expect to see you at the next Session , Count ? ' asked Sviyazhsky . ' but you must come in good time , so as to be there on the eighth .
formerly we used to have so many officials that there had to be an official for everything that was done , and now we have public workers for everything !
of how many institutions are you a member , Nicholas Ivanich ? ' she asked , addressing Sviyazhsky ; ' more than twenty , isn 't it ? '
the players , having chosen their partners , took their places on the carefully levelled and rolled croquet lawn , on the two sides of a net stretched between two small gilded pillars .
Dolly tried to play , but was long unable to understand the game , and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down beside the Princess Barbara to watch the others .
when , after evening tea and a row in the boat at night @-@ time , Dolly entered her bedroom alone , took off her dress and sat down to do up her thin hair for the night , she felt great relief .
several times during the day Anna had begun to talk about intimate matters , but after a few words she had always paused , saying : ' later on when we are alone we will talk it all over .
if he looks for that sort of thing he will find women whose dresses and manners are still brighter and more attractive .
by the very fact of their birth they would have to be ashamed of their mother , their father , their birth ! '
the question for you is , whether you desire not to have any more children ; for me it is , whether I desire to have them .
'Yes , if possible , ' Anna said , in what had suddenly become quite a different - a quiet and sad - voice .
'Well then , we won 't , ' Dolly hastened to say , noticing the look of pain on Anna 's face . ' but I see that you look at things too dismally . '
I not consider that ! ' she repeated , and flushed .
recollections of home and of her children rose in her imagination with a new and peculiar charm .
that world of her own now seemed so precious and dear that she did not wish on any account to spend another day away from it , and she decided certainly to go home on the morrow .
when they had driven into the fields Dolly experienced a pleasant feeling of relief , and she was about to ask the men how they had liked the Vronskys ' place , when suddenly Philip the coachman himself remarked :
in the absence of visitors Anna still continued to devote attention to her person , and read a great deal - both novels and such serious books as were in fashion .
he was astounded at her knowledge and memory , and at first used to doubt her information and want it confirmed . she would then find what he wanted in books and show it him .
had it not been for this ever @-@ increasing desire for freedom - not to have a scene each time he had to go to town to a meeting or to the races - Vronsky would have been quite content with his life .
in spite of the tremendous sums the hospital , the machinery , the cows which he imported from Switzerland , and many other things were costing him , he was sure that he was not wasting his substance but increasing it .
where it was a question of income - the sale of forest land , of corn or wool , or the leasing of land - Vronsky was as hard as flint and could hold out for his price .
in October there were the Nobility elections in the Kashin Province , in which Vronsky 's , Sviyazhsky 's , Koznyshev 's , and also a small part of Levin 's estates were situated .
people living in Moscow and Petersburg as well as others from abroad , who had never come to any elections , assembled at these .
Levin was still wavering , but Kitty , who had noticed that he was dull in Moscow and had advised him to go , without saying anything to him ordered for him the uniform necessary for the occasion , which cost eighty roubles .
Levin had been five days in Kashin , going daily to meetings and taking a great deal of trouble over his sister 's business , which he was still unable to arrange .
the Marshals of the Nobility were all busy with the elections , and he could not get even the simple matter in connection with the wardship settled .
everybody was kind and amiable , but still it turned out that what he wanted to circumvent started up again in another place and impeded him once more .
he always sided with the Nobility in everything , openly opposed the spread of popular education , and gave a class character to the Zemstvo , which should have such enormous importance .
to replace Snetkov as Marshal , Sviyazhsky was proposed , or , better still , Nevedovsky , an ex @-@ professor , a remarkably intelligent man , and a great friend of Koznyshev 's .
in the cathedral Levin , with the others , raised his hand , repeating the words of the priest , and swore by the most awful oaths to fulfil all the things the Governor had hoped for .
on the fourth day the audit of the Provincial Funds was undertaken , and now for the first time there was a conflict between the new and old parties .
thereupon the members of the Commission withdrew their report and Koznyshev began very logically to prove that they must admit either that they had audited the accounts or that they had not done so , and to elaborate this dilemma .
for some of the districts the election was stormy enough ; but for the Selezensk district Sviyazhsky was elected without opposition , and he gave a dinner party at his house that evening .
the old , for the most part , either wore old @-@ fashioned buttoned @-@ up uniforms of their class and carried swords and hats , or wore the naval , cavalry , or infantry uniforms to which each was individually entitled .
the young men wore long @-@ waisted loose uniforms wide across the shoulders with white waistcoats , or else were in uniforms with black collars embroidered with laurel leaves - the emblem of the Ministry of Justice .
some of the young ones , as Levin observed , belonged to the old party , and on the other hand some very aged noblemen conversed in whispers with Sviyazhsky and evidently were warm partisans of the new party .
he was now listening to Sviyazhsky and Hlyustov , the Marshal of another district , who also belonged to their party .
Hlyustov was unwilling to go with the members for his district to invite Snetkov to stand again for election . Sviyazhsky was persuading him to do so and Koznyshev approved of this .
Oblonsky , who had just had something to eat and drink , came toward them in his Chamberlain 's uniform , wiping his mouth with his scented and bordered lawn handkerchief .
'If , as in former elections , all the districts nominated the Provincial Marshal , he would be elected , receiving white balls from every one .
he could not hear distinctly because of the stertorous and hoarse breathing of one nobleman near him and the creaking of the stout shoes of another .
he could hear only the distant soft voice of the Marshal , then the shrill voice of the venomous nobleman , and then Sviyazhsky 's voice .
the Act provided that in case of a difference of opinion the question should be balloted upon .
at this several voices were heard , and the tall landowner with the ring , growing more and more spiteful , shouted louder and louder ; but it was impossible to make out what he was saying .
to free himself from this feeling he went , without waiting to hear the end of the discussion , into the refreshment room , where there was no one except the waiters at the buffet .
replying to the nobles , Snetkov spoke of the confidence and affection of the Nobility , of which he was not worthy , his merit consisting only in his loyalty to the Nobility , to whom he had devoted twenty years of service .
this expression on the Marshal 's face touched Levin , particularly because , just the day before , he had been to his house about the wardship and had there seen him in all the dignity of a kind @-@ hearted family man .
'i have brought one . I soused him , ' said the landowner who had been to fetch him , approaching Sviyazhsky . ' he 'll do . '
'Yes , it 's a dirty business , say what you will , ' remarked an undersized man with a feeble voice .
another group followed close on the heels of a nobleman who was shouting loudly . he was one of those who had been made drunk .
'i always advised Mary Semenovna to let her estate , because she will never make it pay , ' said a pleasant @-@ voiced landowner with a grey moustache , wearing the uniform of Colonel of the former General Staff .
it can 't be grown in a year , ' he remarked cautiously , immediately changing the subject . ' well , and how is your husbandry getting on ? '
why don 't we cut down our limes for bast ? ' said Levin , returning to the thought that had struck him .
'We two have met for the first time since we were at your house , ' said the landowner , ' and have indulged in a chat . '
I think I had the pleasure of meeting you ... at the Princess Shcherbatsky 's ? ' said he , holding out his hand to Levin .
'Yes , it does touch one to the quick , ' replied Vronsky , ' and having once taken the matter up , one wants to carry it through .
'And how is it that you , living constantly in the country ; are not a Justice of the Peace ?
'Because I consider that the magistracy is an idiotic institution , ' morosely replied Levin , who had all the time been looking for an opportunity of speaking to Vronsky , to atone for his rudeness at their first encounter .
'Oh , he is such a crank ! ' said Oblonsky with his smoothest and most almondy smile . ' but come ! I think the ballot has begun ... '
but Count Vronsky ... I do not make a friend of him ; he invited me to dinner and I Shan 't go ; but he is one of our party , so why make an enemy of him ?
'There , you say it 's all trifling , but when you begin on it you make a mess of everything . '
the Marshal of the Province , though he felt in the air that there was a plot prepared against him , and though he had not been unanimously asked to stand , had still decided to do so .
having eaten a cutlet and beans , and talked with the old man about his former masters , Levin , not wishing to return to the hall where he had felt so out of his element , went up into the gallery .
the gallery was crowded with smartly @-@ dressed women who leaned over the balustrade and tried not to miss a single word of what was being said below .
every one was talking about the elections and how tired out the Marshal was and how interesting the debates had been . in one group Levin heard them praising his brother .
'as candidate for the post of Provincial Marshal , Captain Eugene Ivanich Apukhtin will now be balloted for . '
on the stairs he met a couple : a lady running up swiftly in her high @-@ heeled shoes , and the Assistant Public Prosecutor .
'i told you to let no one out ! ' he shouted to the doorkeeper . ' I was letting people in , Your Excellency ! '
he was quite a new man in this circle of noble landowners , but he evidently was a success ; and he was not mistaken in thinking that he had already gained influence among them .
Vronsky sat at the head of the table ; on his right was the young Governor , a General of the Emperor 's suite .
and therefore all that was honest , as he remarked , was on the side of to @-@ day 's success and triumphed in it .
Sviyazhsky comically mimicked the old Marshal 's tearful speech and , turning to Nevedovsky , remarked that His Excellency would have to adopt a different and more complex method of auditing the funds than tears !
this was uttered with the same pleasure with which a newly @-@ married woman is addressed as Madame and called by her husband 's name .
but Dolly , on receiving the telegram , only sighed over the rouble it had cost , and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner .
everything , including the splendid dinner and the wines - which did not come from Russian merchants but were imported ready @-@ bottled from abroad - was very distinguished , simple , and gay .
the company of twenty men had been selected by Sviyazhsky from adherents of the new movement and from Liberals , men who were also witty and respectable .
I expected you the day before yesterday , and yesterday , and am now sending to find out where you are and what the matter is .
the feeling of injury had already passed , and she only feared the expression of his displeasure .
the evening passed happily and cheerfully in the company of the Princess Barbara , who complained to him that in his absence Anna had been taking morphia .
yes , you will come for a day and go away again , as men do ... '
she now distinctly realized the awakening of a new sense of tenderness for the coming ( and for her to some extent already existing ) child , and she yielded with pleasure to that feeling .
the one advantage of this town @-@ life was that here they never quarrelled .
the old Princess , Mary Borisovna , Kitty 's godmother , who had always been very fond of her , particularly wished to see her .
though Kitty was not going out anywhere because of her condition , yet she went with her father to see the venerable old lady , and there met Vronsky .
she exchanged a few words with Vronsky , and even smiled at a joke he made about the elections , to which he alluded as ' our parliament . '
a stranger arrives , sits down , remains a while doing nothing , disturbs them , upsets himself , and goes away again . '
'i did , but I always felt ashamed , and now I am so out of the habit of it that , seriously , I would rather go without dinner for two days than pay that call !
not once since our marriage have I said to myself that things might have been better than they are ... '
at the porch Kuzma , an old servant of his bachelor days , who was now managing the household in town , stopped Levin .
'Krasavchik ' ( one of the pair of carriage horses brought from the country ) ' has been re @-@ shod but still goes lame , ' said he . ' what are your orders ? '
he wanted to arrange the matter as well and as cheaply as possible ; but it turned out that their own horses cost them more than hired ones would have done , and they hired horses as well .
on his way he thought no more about money , but considered how he could make the acquaintance of the Petersburg scholar , who was studying sociology , and how he would talk to him about his book .
'Decidedly you are improving - quite a pleasure to see it , ' said Katavasov as he welcomed Levin in the little drawing @-@ room . ' I heard the bell and thought " It 's impossible he can have come punctually .... "
Katavasov in a few words told him the latest news , and , taking him into the study , introduced Levin to a tall , sturdy , and very agreeable @-@ looking man .
'It is easy to be led astray when drawing conclusions as to the general vocation of a people , ' said Metrov , interrupting Levin . ' the condition of the labourer will always depend on his relation to land and capital . '
this resolution was , in the opinion of some people , a dreadful one , while according to others it was very simple and just . the professors were divided into two camps .
at the table covered with a cloth at which Katavasov and Metrov took their seats six men were sitting , and one of them , with his head bent close over a manuscript , was reading something .
Levin took one of the vacant chairs which were standing round the table , and in a whisper asked a student who was sitting there what was being read .
when the reader had finished , the chairman thanked him and read aloud some verses for the jubilee sent by the poet ment , adding a few words of thanks to the poet .
as Levin had already heard all that , he hastened to tell Metrov that he regretted he was unable to accept his invitation , shook hands , and drove off to the Lvovs ' .
Lvov , WHO WAS married to Kitty 's sister Nataly , had passed all his life in the capitals and abroad , where he had been educated and where he had been in the diplomatic service .
his handsome , refined , and still young @-@ looking face , to which the curly , glossy , silver hair gave a still more well @-@ bred appearance , lit up with a smile when he saw Levin .
even for the children 's lessons I often have to refresh my memory , or even simply to learn things .
I was just reading , ' and he showed Levin Buslaev 's Grammar which lay on the lectern . ' they expect Misha to know this , and it is so difficult ...
Levin tried to explain that it is impossible to understand it and that it must just be learnt by heart ; but Lvov did not agree with him .
Levin had forgotten the commission he had been charged with and only remembered it when on his way to the ante @-@ room .
one was King Lear on the Heath , a Fantasia , and the other was a quartet dedicated to the memory of Bach .
wishing to clear up his own perplexity by hearing other people 's impressions , Levin went to look for the experts , and was pleased to find a celebrated one chatting with his own acquaintance , Pestsov .
'You can 't follow without it , ' said Pestsov turning to Levin , as the man he had been talking to had gone away and he had no one else to talk to .
'They do ; please walk in , ' said the hall @-@ porter , determinedly helping him off with his overcoat .
as he entered the first drawing @-@ room he met in the doorway the Countess Bol , who with an anxious and stern expression was giving orders to a servant .
when she saw Levin she smiled and asked him into the next room , a smaller drawing @-@ room , whence came the sound of voices .
when he had said enough and paused , the Colonel , who till then had kept silent , began also to talk about the opera and about the lighting of the opera @-@ house .
the hall @-@ porter as he helped him on with his overcoat asked where he was staying , and at once entered his address in a large well @-@ bound book .
this hall @-@ porter not only knew Levin but knew all his connections and relatives as well , and at once mentioned some of his intimate friends .
here and there he came across all sorts of people he knew : old and young , some whom he only just knew and some with whom he was intimate .
go to that table , and be quick and secure a seat , ' said the old Prince , and turning away he carefully took a plate of fish soup that was handed to him .
he always liked that good @-@ natured spendthrift Turovtsin ; with him was associated the memory of his proposal to Kitty ; but to @-@ day , after all those strained intellectual conversations , Turovtsin 's good @-@ natured face was particularly welcome .
it might have been thought that from a score of different hors d 'oeuvres it would be possible to select one to any taste , but Oblonsky ordered something special , and one of the liveried footmen brought it at once .
Oblonsky took a glass , and exchanging a look with a bald , red @-@ haired man with a moustache who sat at the other end of their table , smilingly nodded to him .
'He has been congratulated ! ' remarked the Colonel . ' it 's the second time he 's won the Imperial prize . if only I had the luck at cards that he has with horses ! ...
'Well , and how do you like our Temple of idleness ? ' said the Prince , giving him his arm . ' come , let 's walk about a little . '
'Will you come , Prince ? everything is ready , ' said one of his habitual partners , finding him there , and the Prince went away .
Levin sat down for a while and listened , but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard , he suddenly felt terribly bored .
Turovtsin , with a tankard of something to drink , was sitting on the high sofa in the billiard @-@ room , and Oblonsky was talking to Vronsky by the door in the far corner .
he was glad the hostility between Vronsky and himself was ended , and the impression of tranquillity , decorum , and pleasure did not leave him .
'i think you see in every woman only a female , une couveuse ! [ a broody hen . ] necessarily occupied with children if at all ! ' said Oblonsky .
on the top landing a footman bowed to Oblonsky as to some one he knew well , and Oblonsky , asking who was with Anna Arkadyevna , received the answer that it was Mr. Vorkuyev .
passing through a small dining @-@ room , panelled in dark wood , Oblonsky and Levin entered the study across the soft carpet . it was lit by a lamp with a large dark shade .
Levin flushed , and to hide his confusion was about to ask her if it was long since she had seen Dolly , but at that instant Anna herself began to speak .
and her smile and glance told him that she was speaking for him alone , valuing his opinion and knowing in advance that they would understand one another .
she asked Levin and Vorkuyev to pass on into the drawing @-@ room , and herself remained behind to speak to her brother . ' about the divorce ?
'To @-@ day again I did not go to the Court , but to @-@ day I really had no time . '
all the events had consisted of conversations : conversations to which he had listened or in which he had taken part .
the three sisters ' dinner @-@ party would have gone off very well , except that he did not come in as they expected and they all became dull . then the sisters left , and she remained alone .
Kitty 's eyes opened in a peculiar manner and flashed at the mention of Anna 's name , but making an effort she hid her agitation and so deceived him .
when HER VISITORS HAD taken THEIR LEAVE Anna did not sit down , but began pacing up and down the room .
and Steve says he can 't go to see Alexis Alexandrovich ; and I can 't write again .
she must let him see that she was displeased that he had not returned when he had promised - displeased , that should be all ; she would on no account show him her grief , and still less her self @-@ compassion .
what about the races ? you haven 't told me about them , ' and she tried to hide her triumph at her victory , for the victory was hers after all .
but under the influence of weariness , a sleepless night , and the wine he had drunk , he slept soundly and peacefully .
'What ? has it begun ? has it ? ' he asked in a frightened voice . ' we must send ... ' And he began to dress hurriedly .
at that instant he knew that neither his doubts nor the impossibility of believing with his reason - of which he was conscious - all prevented his appealing to God .
this was more than Levin could stand ; he resolutely snatched the bottle out of the man 's hands and rushed out at the big glass door .
the doctor was not up yet , and the footman , now busy putting down a carpet , refused to wake him .
'Good morning ! ' said the doctor , holding out his hand and , as it seemed to Levin , teasing him by his calm manner . ' Don 't hurry !
you see you are inexperienced , I am sure I shall not be needed , but I promised , and if you like I will come .
'i know , I know , ' he said with a smile . ' I am a family man myself .
did you read yesterday 's telegram ? ' asked the doctor , chewing a piece of roll .
'no , I can 't stand it ! ' said Levin , jumping up . ' so you will come in a quarter of an hour ? '
he was surprised when Mary Vlasevna asked him to light a candle behind the partition , and he learnt that it was already five o 'clock in the evening .
Kitty 's burning face , worn with suffering , with a lock of hair clinging to her clammy forehead , was turned toward him trying to catch his eye .
'It 's all right , it 's all right ! all goes well ! ' Dolly called after him .
the terrible screaming did not cease , but grew yet more awful until , as if it had reached the utmost limit of horror , it suddenly ceased .
falling on his knees by her bedside he held his wife 's hand to his lips , kissing it , and that hand , by a feeble movement of the fingers , replied to the kisses .
Don 't be anxious , ' Levin heard Mary Vlasevna say , as she slapped the baby 's back with a shaking hand .
and amid the silence , as a positive answer to the mother 's question , a voice quite unlike all the restrained voices that had been speaking in the room made itself heard .
he felt as if he were on some unattainable height , from which he painstakingly descended in order not to hurt the feelings of those with whom he was conversing .
he talked but never ceased thinking of his wife , of the details of her present condition , and of his son - to the idea of whose existence he painstakingly tried to accustom himself .
Levin , gazing at this tiny piteous being , vainly searched his soul for some indications of paternal feeling .
and Mary Vlasevna held out to Levin on one hand ( the other merely supporting the nape of the shaky head ) this strange , limp , red creature , that hid its head in its swaddling clothes .
smiling , and hardly able to keep back tears of tenderness , Levin kissed his wife and quitted the darkened room .
two @-@ thirds of the money for the forest had already been spent , and by allowing a discount of ten per cent he had obtained from the merchant almost the whole of the last third .
sitting in Karenin 's study and listening to his article on ' The Causes of the Bad State of Russian Finance , ' Oblonsky only waited for him to conclude to speak about his own affairs and about Anna .
'i consider , and I have written an article on the point , that the enormous salaries paid nowadays are a symptom of the false economic position of our administration . '
'But I understood that Anna Arkadyevna declined a divorce if I insisted on keeping my son .
'For heaven 's sake don 't excite yourself , ' said Oblonsky , touching his brother @-@ in @-@ law 's knee . ' the matter is not closed .
and now in Moscow where every time she meets anyone it is like a knife in her heart , she has been living for six months every day expecting your decision .
'i have never refused to do what is possible , but I want time to consider in how far what was promised is possible . '
vous professez d 'être un libre Penseur , [ You profess to be a freethinker . ] but I , as a believer , in so important a matter CANNOT act contrary to the Christian law . '
'He was very ill after that unexpected interview with his mother , ' remarked Karenin . ' we even feared for his life .
but sensible treatment and sea @-@ bathing in the summer have restored his health , and now , on the doctor 's advice , I send him to school .
the influence of his schoolfellows has really had a good effect on him , and he is quite well and learns well . '
during this year he had been sent to school , and had learned to know his schoolmates and to like them .
when they rose in his memory he took pains to drive them away , considering them shameful and fit only for girls , but not for a boy and a chum .
he knew that his father and mother had had a quarrel which separated them ; knew that it was his fate to remain with his father , and he tried to accustom himself to that thought .
he had a wife and family with grown @-@ up sons who were pages at Court ; and another family , an illegitimate one , in which there were other children .
Bartnyansky , who spent at least fifty thousand roubles a year at the rate he was living , had the day before made a notable remark to him on the point .
'Never mind the name , I shouldn 't remember it ! ... But why do you want to mix in those railway concerns , with Jews ? ...
Petrovsky had run through five millions , continued living in just the same style , and even directed the Finance Department and received a salary of twenty thousand .
but the Princess Myagkaya immediately interrupted him , as was her habit , and commenced telling her own tale .
now that he has got so chummy with Lydia Ivanovna and Landau , every one says he is half @-@ witted ; and I should be glad not to agree with everybody , but this time I can 't help it . '
Landau , you see , was a commis [ Shop @-@ assistant . ] in Paris and went to see a doctor .
he fell asleep in the doctor 's waiting @-@ room , and while asleep began giving advice to all the patients , and very strange advice too .
afterwards , Yury Meledinsky 's wife ( the invalid 's wife , you know ) heard of that Landau , and took him to see her husband .
it was still quite light out of doors , but in the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's small drawing @-@ room the blinds were down and the lamp alight .
'i introduced him to you as Landau , ' she said softly , glancing at the Frenchman and then back at Oblonsky , ' but really he is Count Bezzubov , as you probably know .
[ the friends of our friends are our friends . ] But to be a friend , one must enter into the state of the friend 's soul , and I fear you will not do so in relation to Alexis Alexandrovich .
won 't you have some tea ? ' she said , indicating with her eyes the footman who was handing tea round on a tray .
'Yes , a misfortune which has turned into a great blessing , because his heart became new and is filled with Him , ' she said , glancing at Oblonsky with lovesick eyes .
'To labour for God with works ; to save one 's soul by fasting , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna with fastidious disdain , ' those are the barbarous opinions of our monks ...
we are saved by faith , ' Karenin chimed in , showing his approval of her remark by a look .
well , and what happened ? she found this Friend , and now she thanks God for her child 's death .
'no , evidently it will be better not to ask for anything to @-@ night , ' he reflected ; ' only let me get away from here without making a mess of things ! '
'It will be dull for you , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , turning to Landau , ' as you don 't understand English ; but it is quite short . '
listening to the Countess Lydia Ivanovna and feeling the fine eyes , naive or roguish - he did not know which - of Landau fixed upon him , Oblonsky began to be conscious of a peculiar sort of heaviness in his head .
Karenin rose , and though he tried to be cautious he caught against the table . he went up to the Frenchman and placed his hand in his .
she wrote that she greatly wished to finish the conversation they had begun , and asked him to call next day .
for a long time she could not believe that the dispute had begun from a perfectly inoffensive conversation about a matter that did not touch the heart of either .
he spoke disrespectfully of the education of women in general , and said that Hannah , her little English protegée , did not at all need to know physics .
'i know what he wanted to say : he wanted to say that it is unnatural not to love one 's own daughter and yet to love another 's child .
no , he must be in love with some other woman ; it can 't be anything else . '
then , realizing that in her attempt to quiet herself she had again completed the circle she had already gone round so often , and had returned to her former cause of irritation , she was horror @-@ struck at herself .
yes , now , as soon as he comes back , I will tell him I was to blame , though in fact I was not , and we will go away ! '
and not to continue thinking , and not to yield to irritation , she rang and ordered her trunks to be brought , to pack their things for the country .
when he returned she told him , partly repeating words she had prepared , how she had spent the day and her plans for the move to the country .
'Do you know , it came to me almost like an inspiration ? ' said she . ' why must we wait here for the divorce ?
I don 't want to hope , I don 't want to hear anything about the divorce .
it was no longer the Queen of Sweden 's instructress but the Princess Sorokina who lived in the country near Moscow with the Countess Vronskaya who presented herself to Anna 's imagination .
'i will go to maman at once . she can send me the money through Egorov and I shall be ready to go to @-@ morrow , ' said he .
'i did not wish to show it you , because Steve has a passion for telegraphing . what is the use of telegraphing when nothing has been settled ? '
Anna took the telegram with trembling hands and saw exactly what Vronsky had said , but at the end were added the words : ' little hope , but I 'll do everything possible and impossible . '
the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute , and it irritated her .
'It is perfectly indifferent to me what your mother thinks and whom she wishes to marry you to , ' she went on , putting down her cup with a trembling hand .
and believe me , a heartless woman , be she old or young , your mother or a stranger , does not interest me , and I don 't want to have anything to do with her . '
'Oh , I don 't know . I don 't think I shall get it all , and on Wednesday I must go .
but , you see , some men find it possible to sit down to cards and yet to be able always to leave when the time comes for an assignation !
now I can engage in love @-@ making , but always so as not to be late for cards in the evening .
[ so much the worse for her . ] But , as he was going out , he thought she said something , and suddenly his heart ached with pity for her .
he even wished to stop and say a comforting word to her , but his legs carried him out of the room before he had thought of anything to say .
all the cruellest words that a coarse man could say he , in her imagination , said to her , and she did not forgive him for them any more than if he had really said them .
and he loves me ; All this has been , but will pass , ' she said , feeling that tears of joy at this return to life were running down her cheeks .
he could still call her back , but she reached the door and he remained silent , and only the rustle of the paper as he turned a page was heard .
alarmed by the despairing look with which she had said these words , he jumped up , intending to run after her , but , recollecting himself , he sat down again , tightly clenching his teeth and frowning .
she went back to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking , and , having touched the coachman 's back with his hand , say something to him .
the little girl , sitting at the table , persistently and firmly hammered on it with the stopper of a bottle , gazing blankly at her mother with her two black @-@ currants of eyes .
if I don 't believe him , there is only one way left for me ... and I don 't want that . '
'Annushka , my dear ! what am I to do ? ' muttered Anna sobbing , as she sank helplessly into an arm @-@ chair .
that same Kitty with whom Vronsky was in love , ' thought Anna . ' she whom he remembered affectionately .
Dolly went out alone to meet the visitor who at that moment had come to interrupt their talk .
but he has not refused ; on the contrary , Steve is hopeful , ' added Dolly , pausing at the door .
'What does it mean ? Kitty considers it humiliating to meet me ! ' thought Anna when she was left alone .
having mustered up her courage , Kitty came in and , blushing , went up to Anna and held out her hand .
to her former torments was now added a feeling of being affronted and repudiated , of which she had been clearly sensible during the meeting with Kitty .
she gave the order to harness another pair of horses , and busied herself packing her handbag with things necessary for a few days .
Annushka , who came out with Anna 's things , and Peter , who put them into the carriage , and the coachman , who was evidently dissatisfied , were all objectionable to her and irritated her by their words and movements .
glancing in the direction in which Peter was looking she saw a workman , nearly dead @-@ drunk , with his head swaying about , who was being led off somewhere by a policeman .
as she moved among the crowd toward the first @-@ class waiting @-@ room she gradually recalled all the details of her position and the resolutions between which she vacillated .
Peter with a stupid smile raised his gold @-@ braided hat to take leave of her ; an insolent guard slammed the door to and drew the latch .
some one from there was here just now , to meet the Princess Sorokina and her daughter .
gazing into her face and laughing and shouting unnaturally they again passed by .
some ladies and children , who had come to meet a spectacled gentleman and were laughing and talking noisily , became silent and gazed at her as she passed them .
the platform shook , and it seemed to her as if she were again in the tram .
it was already the middle of the hot summer , but Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev was only now preparing to leave Moscow .
his book , the result of six years ' labour , entitled , An Attempt to Review the Foundations and Forms of Government of Europe and Russia , had been finished a year ago .
the book had been issued last year after careful revision , and had been sent out to the booksellers .
among the people to whom he belonged , nothing was written or talked about at that time except the Serbian war .
the massacre of our co @-@ religionists and brother Slavs evoked sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against their oppressors .
and the heroism of the Serbs and Montenegrins , fighting for a great cause , aroused in the whole nation a desire to help their brothers not only with words but by deeds .
Katavasov , who had promised Levin to visit him , and had long been meaning to keep that promise , accompanied Koznyshev .
I said so ! ' the lady said joyfully . ' and isn 't it true that about a million roubles have been collected ? '
they were talking of the latest telegram , confirming the report that for three consecutive days the Turks had been beaten at all points and were in flight , and that a decisive battle was expected next day .
having obtained such details as the Princess could give about the young petitioner , Koznyshev went into the first @-@ class waiting @-@ room , wrote a note to the person on whom the decision depended , and gave it to the Princess .
'Do you know that the well @-@ known Count Vronsky is going by this train ? ' remarked the Princess with a triumphant and significant smile , when Koznyshev had found her again and given her the note .
every one shouted ' Zhivio ! ' and a fresh crowd surged into the refreshment @-@ room , nearly knocking the Princess off her feet .
however , tell her , if you 'll be so kind , that I am appointed Member of the Committee of the Joint ...
'i can 't look calmly at those collecting @-@ boxes while I have any money , ' he remarked . ' and what a telegram that was to @-@ day !
'There he is ! ' said the Princess , pointing to Vronsky who , in a long overcoat and a black broad @-@ brimmed hat , was passing with his mother on his arm .
on the platform ' God save the Tsar ' was struck up , followed by ' hurrah ' and ' zhivio ' !
one of the Volunteers , a tall , hollow @-@ chested , very young man , was bowing in a specially noticeable way , waving over his head a felt hat and a bouquet .
from behind him two officers and an elderly man with a large beard and a greasy cap thrust their heads out , and also bowed .
having taken LEAVE OF THE Princess , Koznyshev with Katavasov , who had joined him , entered the very crowded carriage , and the train started .
opposite him sat an officer , no longer young , wearing a military jacket of the Austrian Guards .
getting into conversation with the young man , Katavasov learnt that he had been a rich Moscow merchant but had run through a large fortune before he was twenty @-@ two .
he was a modest , quiet man , who evidently deferred to the knowledge of the retired Guardsman and to the heroic self @-@ sacrifice of the merchant and did not talk at all about himself .
'i did not serve in the artillery long . I am a retired Cadet , ' he said , and began to explain why he had not passed the examination for a commission .
all this put together produced on Katavasov a disagreeable impression , and when the Volunteers got out at a station to have a drink he wished to verify this unfavourable impression by a talk with somebody .
one of the passengers , an old man in a military overcoat , had been listening all the time to Katavasov 's conversation with the Volunteers . when they were left alone together Katavasov addressed him .
'What a variety there is in the positions of all these men who are going there ! ' Katavasov remarked vaguely , wishing to express his own opinion but at the same time to draw the old man .
we took away everything that he could kill himself with . we lived on the ground floor , but one could not tell what he might do .
in the evening I had only just gone to my room when my Mary told me that at the station a lady had thrown herself under a train .
'Oh no ! ' replied Vronsky , as if it cost him an effort to understand . ' if you don 't mind , let us walk up and down .
I am glad that there is something for which I can lay down the life which I not only do not want , but of which I am sick !
and having spoken about the proposed proclamation of Milan as King and of the immense results this might have , they returned to their respective carriages after the second bell had already sounded .
'Aren 't you ashamed of yourself for not letting us know ? ' she said , holding out her hand to him and offering her forehead for a kiss .
it was not a mere guess - the bond between herself and the baby had not yet been severed - and she knew surely by the flow of milk within herself that he was wanting food .
'But one must , you know , ma 'am , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna , who was almost always in the nursery . ' he must be properly tidied up !
'Well , all right , all right ! we shall see , ' Kitty whispered . ' but now go away , he is falling asleep . '
only now and then the baby , continuing his business , lifted his long curved lashes and looked at his mother with moist eyes that seemed black in the dim light .
if I don 't see to it , Agatha Mikhaylovna will give Sergius Ivanich used bed @-@ linen ! ' and the very thought of this sent the blood into Kitty 's face .
Dolly was in despair ; she hated her husband , despised him , pitied him , made up her mind to divorce him and to refuse ; but ended by consenting to sell part of her estate .
and he not only failed to find in the whole arsenal of his convictions any kind of answer , but he could not even find anything resembling an answer .
he was in the position of a man seeking for food in a toyshop or at a gunsmith 's .
involuntarily and unconsciously , in every book , in every conversation , and in every person he met , he now sought for their relation to those questions and for a solution to them .
but that moment had passed , and he could not allot any place in his life to the state of mind he had then experienced .
Levin read the second volume of them , and in spite of its polemical , polished , and witty style , which at first repelled him , he was struck by its teaching about the Church .
he was struck by the thought that it is not given to isolated man to attain divine truth , but that it is given to a community united by love - the Church .
'in an infinity of time , and in infinity of matter , in infinite space , a bubble , a bubble organism , separates itself , and that bubble maintains itself awhile and then bursts , and that bubble is - I ! '
this was a distressing falsehood , but it was the sole and last result of centuries and the age @-@ long labour of human thought in that direction .
an end had to be put to that dependence on an evil power ; and there was one means - death .
he might sell straw to the peasants in a time of shortage , though he felt sorry for them ; but an inn or a public @-@ house , although it brought in a revenue , must be done away with .
he must lend money to Peter to liberate him from the usurers to whom he was paying ten per cent. a month ; but he must neither reduce or postpone the payments of rent by the peasants who were in default .
the steward must not be excused when the small meadow was not mown and the grass was wasted ; but grass must not be mown on the eighty desyatinas which had been planted with young trees .
Levin got into conversation with Theodore about that land , and asked whether Plato , a well @-@ to @-@ do. and worthy peasant of that village , would not rent that land next year .
'the rent is too high , Constantine Dmitrich , ' answered Theodore , picking out the ears of rye from the front of his damp shirt .
and having understood them , did I doubt their justice ? did I find them stupid , vague , or inexact ?
and then that same Theodore says that it is wrong to live for one 's belly , and that we must live for Truth , for God , and at the first hint I understand him !
a physical miracle would have tempted me . but here is a miracle , the one possible , everlasting miracle , all around me , and I did not notice it !
he was breathless with excitement and , incapable of going further , he turned from the road into the wood and sat down on the uncut grass in the shade of the aspens .
and I was surprised that , in spite of the greatest effort of thought on that path , the meaning of life , the meaning of my impulses and my aspirations , was not revealed to me .
now it was clear to him that he was only able to live , thanks to the beliefs in which he had been brought up .
'What should I have been and how should I have lived my life , if I had not had those beliefs , and had not known that one must live for God , and not for one 's own needs ?
left by themselves , the children had started cooking raspberries over a candle , and pouring jets of milk into their mouths .
now we 've thought of putting raspberries in a cup and cooking them over a candle , and of pouring milk into each other 's mouths like fountains .
'Don 't we , and didn 't I , do just the same , when intellectually I sought for the meaning of the forces of nature and the purpose of human life ? ' he went on thinking .
'Yes , what I know , I know not by my reason but because it has been given to me , revealed to me , and I know it in my heart by faith in the chief thing which the Church proclaims .
and it now seemed to him that there was not one of the dogmas of the Church which could disturb the principal thing - faith in God , in goodness , as the sole vocation of man .
as if just awakened from a dream , it was long before he could collect his thoughts .
Katavasov was very fond of talking about philosophy , having a conception of it which he had acquired from naturalists who had never studied it , and in Moscow Levin had latterly had many disputes with him .
Levin always advised his wife not to take the child into the wood , considering it dangerous , and this news was disagreeable to him .
'She wanders about with him from place to place , ' said the old Prince with a smile . ' I advised her to try taking him to the ice @-@ cellar ! '
'Well , I have finally convinced myself that I Shan 't find solutions of the questions I am concerned about in him , or in people of his kind .
trying to make as few brusque movements as possible and listening to the bees that flew past him more and more often , he went along the path to the hut .
on the other side of the fence an old man was making a hoop and did not notice Levin , who stopped in the middle of the apiary without calling him .
Koznyshev did not reply , but with the blunt side of a knife carefully extracted from a bowl in which lay a wedge of white honeycomb a live bee that had stuck in the running honey .
in heaven 's name , Sergius Ivanich , explain to me where all these Volunteers are going and whom they are fighting , ' said the old Prince , evidently continuing a conversation that had been started during Levin 's absence .
'the Turks ! ' answered Koznyshev , quietly smiling , having extracted the bee which , black with honey , moved its legs helplessly. as he shifted it from the knife to a firm aspen leaf .
'But the Prince is not talking of help , ' interposed Levin , taking his father @-@ in @-@ law 's side , ' but of war !
'Perhaps , ' said Levin evasively , ' but I don 't see it . I myself am one of the people , and I don 't feel it . '
shall I bring some more bread and give the laddie a bit ? ' he asked Dolly , pointing to Grisha , who was finishing his crust .
the most divergent parties in the intellectual world , previously so hostile to one another , have all merged into one .
'Yes , he asked me to tell Darya Alexandrovna that he has got the post , ' said Koznyshev discontentedly , considering that what the Prince was saying was not to the point .
it has been explained to me : as soon as there is a war their revenue is doubled .
how can they help considering that the fate of the people and the Slavs - and all the rest of it ? '
he who preaches war - off with him in a special legion to the assault , to the attack , in front of everybody else ! " -'
the unanimous and complete expression of public opinion is a service rendered by the Press , and is also a gratifying phenomenon .
Levin flushed with annoyance , not at being beaten , but because he had not refrained from the dispute .
he saw that it was not possible to convince his brother and Katavasov , and still less did he see any possibility of himself agreeing with them .
the PRINCE AND KOZNYSHEV GOT INTO THE TRAP and drove off ; the rest of the party , hastening their steps , went home on foot .
when they were still about two hundred paces from the house the wind had already risen , so that at any moment a downpour might be expected .
a white curtain of pouring rain was already descending over the distant wood and half the neighbouring field , and was advancing rapidly toward the Kolok .
they were at the other end of the wood , under an old lime tree , and were calling him .
after the rain it was too wet to go out walking , besides which the thunder @-@ clouds had not cleared from the horizon , and , now here now there , passed thundering and darkening along the borders of the sky .
Koznyshev too was in good spirits and at tea , led on by his brother , expounded his views of the future of the Eastern question , and did it so simply and well that every one listened attentively .
he did not now recall , as he had done before , the whole course of his thoughts ( he did not now need to ) .
Kitty was standing , with her sleeves rolled up , beside the bath in which the baby was splashing about , and hearing her husband 's step she turned her face toward him , beckoning him with a smile .
with one hand supporting the head of the plump kicking baby who floated on his back , with the other she squeezed the water from a sponge over him , regularly exerting the muscles of her arm .
Levin listened to the rhythmical dripping of raindrops from the lime trees in the garden , and looked at a familiar triangular constellation and at the Milky Way which with its branches intersected it .
by the light of that flash she saw the whole of his face and , noticing that he was calm and happy , she smiled at him .
'This new feeling has not changed me , has not rendered me happy , nor suddenly illuminated me as I dreamt it would , but is just like my feeling for my son .
