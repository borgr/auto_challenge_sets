to every animal of the earth , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that cre@@ eps on the earth , in which there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for food " ; and it was so .
now the ser@@ pent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God had made . he said to the woman , " Has God really said , ' You shall not eat of any tree of the garden ? ' "
they heard the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the garden .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
C@@ ain said to A@@ bel , his brother , " Let 's go into the field . " it happened when they were in the field , that C@@ ain rose up against A@@ bel , his brother , and killed him .
behold , you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fu@@ gi@@ tive and a wan@@ der@@ er in the earth . it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground ; man , along with animals , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . "
you shall make a roof in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cub@@ it upward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you will be on every animal of the earth , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground te@@ ems with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will surely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from Sid@@ on , as you go toward Ger@@ ar , to Gaza ; as you go toward So@@ dom , Gom@@ or@@ rah , Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , to L@@ asha .
why did you say , ' She is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
there was a strife between the her@@ d@@ smen of Ab@@ ram 's livestock and the her@@ d@@ smen of L@@ ot 's livestock : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite lived in the land at that time .
lot lifted up his eyes , and saw all the plain of the Jordan , that it was well @@@ -@@ @ wat@@ ered everywhere , before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h destroyed So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , like the garden of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , like the land of Egypt , as you go to Zo@@ ar .
one who had escaped came and told Ab@@ ram , the Hebrew . now he lived by the o@@ aks of Mam@@ re , the A@@ mor@@ ite , brother of E@@ sh@@ col , and brother of An@@ er ; and these were allies of Ab@@ ram .
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men who went with me : An@@ er , E@@ sh@@ col , and Mam@@ re . let them take their portion . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought him outside , and said , " Look now toward the sky , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . " he said to Ab@@ ram , " So shall your seed be . "
I will give to you , and to your seed after you , the land where you are traveling , all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for an everlasting possession . I will be their God . "
then Abraham fell on his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , " Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old ? will Sarah , who is ninety years old , give birth ? "
for I have known him , to the end that he may command his children and his household after him , that they may keep the way of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to do righteousness and justice ; to the end that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him . "
what if there will lack five of the fifty righteous ? will you destroy all the city for lack of five ? " he said , " I will not destroy it , if I find forty @@@ -@@ @ five there . "
he spoke to him yet again , and said , " What if there are forty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it for the forty 's sake . "
he said , " Oh don '@@ t let the Lord be angry , and I will speak . what if there are thirty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it , if I find thirty there . "
it came to pass , when they had taken them out , that he said , " Es@@ cape for your life ! Don '@@ t look behind you , and don '@@ t stay anywhere in the plain . escape to the mountains , lest you be consumed ! "
did@@ n '@@ t he tell me , ' She is my sister ? ' she , even she herself , said , ' He is my brother . ' in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this . "
now therefore , restore the man 's wife . for he is a prophet , and he will pray for you , and you will live . if you don '@@ t restore her , know for sure that you will die , you , and all who are yours . "
to Sarah he said , " Be@@ hold , I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver . behold , it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you . in front of all you are v@@ indicated . "
Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread and a bottle of water , and gave it to Hag@@ ar , putting it on her shoulder ; and gave her the child , and sent her away . she departed , and wan@@ dered in the wilderness of Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bow shot away . for she said , " Don '@@ t let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and we@@ pt .
God heard the voice of the boy . the angel of God called to Hag@@ ar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hag@@ ar ? Don '@@ t be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
Abraham rose early in the morning , and sadd@@ led his don@@ key , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the th@@ icket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
that he may give me the cave of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place . "
" no , my lord , hear me . I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you . bury your dead . "
so the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , which was in Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which was before Mam@@ re , the field , the cave which was in it , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all of its borders , were de@@ eded
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her p@@ itch@@ er , and came up .
the man came into the house , and he un@@ loaded the cam@@ els . he gave straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for the cam@@ els , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
I asked her , and said , ' Wh@@ ose daughter are you ? ' she said , ' The daughter of Beth@@ u@@ el , N@@ ah@@ or 's son , whom Mil@@ ca@@ h bore to him . ' I put the ring on her nose , and the brac@@ elets on her hands .
she said to the servant , " Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? " the servant said , " It is my master . " she took her veil , and covered herself .
these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ne@@ bai@@ o@@ th , then K@@ edar , Ad@@ be@@ el , Mi@@ b@@ s@@ am ,
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to her , " Two nations are in your womb . two peoples will be separated from your body . the one people will be stronger than the other people . the elder will serve the younger . "
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will bless you . for to you , and to your seed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I s@@ wore to Abraham your father .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to him the same night , and said , " I am the God of Abraham your father . Don '@@ t be afraid , for I am with you , and will bless you , and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham 's sake . "
they said , " We saw plainly that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was with you . we said , ' Let there now be an oath between us , even between us and you , and let us make a covenant with you ,
that you will do us no harm , as we have not touched you , and as we have done to you nothing but good , and have sent you away in peace . ' you are now the blessed of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
he said , " B@@ ring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " B@@ less me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac answered Es@@ au , " Be@@ hold , I have made him your lord , and all his brothers have I given to him for servants . with grain and new wine have I sustained him . what then will I do for you , my son ? "
Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah said to Isaac , " I am weary of my life because of the daughters of H@@ eth . if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of H@@ eth , such as these , of the daughters of the land , what good will my life do me ? "
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
it happened , when Jacob saw Rach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Lab@@ an heard the news of Jacob , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jacob , and embraced him , and kis@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . Jacob told Lab@@ an all these things .
it happened in the morning that , behold , it was Le@@ ah . he said to Lab@@ an , " What is this you have done to me ? did@@ n '@@ t I serve with you for Rach@@ el ? why then have you deceived me ? "
she said to her , " Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband ? would you take away my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes , also ? " Rach@@ el said , " T@@ herefore he will lie with you tonight for your son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . "
Jacob came from the field in the evening , and Le@@ ah went out to meet him , and said , " You must come in to me ; for I have surely hired you with my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . " he lay with her that night .
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multitude . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed you wherever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
that day , he removed the male goats that were stre@@ aked and spotted , and all the female goats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ' Take heed to yourself that you don '@@ t speak to Jacob either good or bad . '
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
you shall say , ' Not only that , but behold , your servant , Jacob , is behind us . ' " for , he said , " I will appe@@ ase him with the present that goes before me , and afterward I will see his face . perhaps he will accept me . "
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Es@@ au was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Le@@ ah , Rach@@ el , and the two hand@@ m@@ aids .
please let my lord pass over before his servant , and I will lead on gently , according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord to Se@@ ir . "
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it . the men were griev@@ ed , and they were very angry , because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; a which thing ought not to be done .
" these men are peaceful with us . therefore let them live in the land and trade in it . for behold , the land is large enough for them . let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
these are the sons of Re@@ u@@ el , Es@@ au 's son : chief N@@ ah@@ ath , chief Zer@@ ah , chief Sham@@ ma@@ h , chief M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of Re@@ u@@ el in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bas@@ em@@ ath , Es@@ au 's wife .
these are the sons of O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife : chief Je@@ ush , chief Jal@@ am , chief Kor@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife .
he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brothers , and said , " Be@@ hold , I have dreamed yet another dream : and behold , the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . "
he said to him , " Go now , see whether it is well with your brothers , and well with the flock ; and bring me word again . " so he sent him out of the valley of He@@ br@@ on , and he came to Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
Jud@@ ah said to On@@ an , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
On@@ an knew that the seed w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
he said , " I will send you a young goat from the flock . " she said , " Will you give me a pledge , until you send it ? "
it happened about three months later , that it was told Jud@@ ah , saying , " Tam@@ ar , your daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , has played the pro@@ stitute ; and moreover , behold , she is with child by prostitution . " Jud@@ ah said , " B@@ ring her out , and let her be burnt . "
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Po@@ ti@@ p@@ har , an officer of Phar@@ aoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites that had brought him down there .
she called to the men of her house , and spoke to them , saying , " Be@@ hold , he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mo@@ ck us . he came in to me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice .
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kind@@ led .
Phar@@ aoh said to Joseph , " I have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpret it . "
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth .
Re@@ ub@@ en answered them , saying , " did@@ n '@@ t I tell you , saying , ' Don '@@ t sin against the child , ' and you w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
he said to his brothers , " My money is restored ! behold , it is in my sack ! " their hearts failed them , and they turned trembling one to another , saying , " What is this that God has done to us ? "
Jacob , their father , said to them , " You have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed me of my children ! Joseph is no more , Sim@@ eon is no more , and you want to take Benjamin away . all these things are against me . "
Jud@@ ah said to Israel , his father , " Send the boy with me , and we 'll get up and go , so that we may live , and not die , both we , and you , and also our little ones .
he said , " Peace be to you . Don '@@ t be afraid . your God , and the God of your father , has given you treasure in your s@@ acks . I received your money . " he brought Sim@@ eon out to them .
when they had gone out of the city , and were not yet far off , Joseph said to his ste@@ ward , " Up , follow after the men . when you over@@ take them , ask them , ' Why have you rewarded evil for good ?
behold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
Jud@@ ah said , " What will we tell my lord ? what will we speak ? or how will we clear ourselves ? God has found out the ini@@ qu@@ ity of your servants . behold , we are my lord 's bond@@ servants , both we , and he also in whose hand the cup is found . "
he said , " Far be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the cup is found , he will be my bond@@ servant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Jud@@ ah came near to him , and said , " Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and don '@@ t let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even as Phar@@ aoh .
we said to my lord , ' We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother ; and his father loves him . '
it will happen , when he sees that the boy is no more , that he will die . your servants will bring down the gray ha@@ irs of your servant , our father , with sorrow to She@@ ol .
then Joseph cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don '@@ t wait .
he said , " I am God , the God of your father . Don '@@ t be afraid to go down into Egypt , for there I will make of you a great nation .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Phar@@ aoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , have come to me .
that you shall say , ' Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now , both we , and our fathers : ' that you may dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen ; for every shepherd is an ab@@ om@@ ination to the Egyptians . "
they said to Phar@@ aoh , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no past@@ ure for your servants ' f@@ locks . for the famine is severe in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . now therefore , please let your servants dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen . "
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , and said , " Gi@@ ve us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
and said to me , ' Be@@ hold , I will make you fruitful , and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession . '
as for me , when I came from P@@ add@@ an , Rach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when there was still some distance to come to E@@ phr@@ ath , and I buried her there in the way to E@@ phr@@ ath ( the same is Bethlehem ) . "
the angel who has re@@ deemed me from all evil , bless the lad@@ s , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . "
Jud@@ ah is a lion 's cu@@ b . from the prey , my son , you have gone up . he sto@@ op@@ ed down , he c@@ rou@@ ched as a lion , as a lion@@ ess . who will r@@ ouse him up ?
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Almighty , who will bless you , with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies below , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb .
when the days of we@@ eping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Phar@@ aoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Phar@@ aoh , saying ,
when the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , saw the mourning in the floor of At@@ ad , they said , " This is a griev@@ ous mourning by the Egyptians . " therefore its name was called A@@ bel M@@ iz@@ ra@@ im , which is beyond the Jordan .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which Abraham bought with the field , for a possession of a burial site , from E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite , before Mam@@ re .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am dying , but God will surely visit you , and bring you up out of this land to the land which he s@@ wore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . "
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ yr@@ us basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
now when Phar@@ aoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Phar@@ aoh , and lived in the land of Mi@@ dian , and he sat down by a well .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush . he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saw that he turned aside to see , God called to him out of the midst of the bush , and said , " Moses ! Moses ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " I have surely seen the afflic@@ tion of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry because of their t@@ ask@@ masters , for I know their sor@@ rows .
Moses said to God , " Be@@ hold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fathers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and tell them , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , has appeared to me , saying , " I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt ;
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jew@@ els of silver , jew@@ els of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall pl@@ under the Egyptians . "
" that they may believe that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has appeared to you . "
and I have said to you , " Let my son go , that he may serve me " ; and you have refused to let him go . behold , I will kill your son , your fir@@ st@@ born . ' "
then Zi@@ p@@ por@@ ah took a fl@@ int , and cut off the fores@@ kin of her son , and cast it at his feet ; and she said , " Su@@ rely you are a bri@@ deg@@ room of blood to me . "
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Phar@@ aoh , " This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
they said , " The God of the He@@ bre@@ ws has met with us . please let us go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , our God , lest he fall on us with pesti@@ l@@ ence , or with the sword . "
no straw is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Make brick ! ' and behold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
and they said to them , " May Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h look at you , and judge , because you have made us a sten@@ ch to be ab@@ hor@@ red in the eyes of Phar@@ aoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to kill us . "
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
go to Phar@@ aoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a ser@@ pent you shall take in your hand .
you shall tell him , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , has sent me to you , saying , " Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : " and behold , until now you haven '@@ t listened .
Moses and Aaron did so , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Phar@@ aoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
then Phar@@ aoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , " entre@@ at Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he take away the fro@@ gs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' St@@ ret@@ ch out your rod , and strike the dust of the earth , that it may become l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt . ' "
they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and struck the dust of the earth , and there were l@@ ice on man , and on animal ; all the dust of the earth became l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt .
then the mag@@ icians said to Phar@@ aoh , " This is the finger of God : " and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , and he did@@ n '@@ t listen to them ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
I will set apart in that day the land of Gos@@ hen , in which my people dwell , that no s@@ war@@ ms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the midst of the earth .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did so ; and there came griev@@ ous s@@ war@@ ms of flies into the house of Phar@@ aoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the s@@ war@@ ms of flies .
Phar@@ aoh said , " I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God in the wilderness , only you shall not go very far away . pray for me . "
Moses said , " Be@@ hold , I go out from you , and I will pray to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that the s@@ war@@ ms of flies may depart from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people , tomorrow ; only don '@@ t let Phar@@ aoh deal dece@@ it@@ fully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Go in to Phar@@ aoh , and tell him , ' This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before Phar@@ aoh , and tell him , ' This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the th@@ un@@ ders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the lo@@ cu@@ sts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
the lo@@ cu@@ sts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very griev@@ ous . before them there were no such lo@@ cu@@ sts as they , neither after them shall be such .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Phar@@ aoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh who sits on his throne , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of livestock .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Phar@@ aoh in hot anger .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you , when I strike the land of Egypt .
" ' seven days you shall eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leav@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordin@@ ance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leav@@ ened , that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lin@@ tel , and on the two door@@ posts , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will pass over the door , and will not allow the destro@@ yer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it happened at midnight , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh who sat on his throne to the fir@@ st@@ born of the captive who was in the dun@@ geon ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of livestock .
Moses said to the people , " Rem@@ ember this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age ; for by strength of hand Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought you out from this place . no leav@@ ened bread shall be eaten .
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may be in your mouth ; for with a strong hand Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has brought you out of Egypt .
every fir@@ st@@ born of a don@@ key you shall re@@ deem with a lamb ; and if you will not re@@ deem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall re@@ deem all the fir@@ st@@ born of man among your sons .
it happened , when Phar@@ aoh had let the people go , that God did@@ n '@@ t lead them by the way of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , although that was near ; for God said , " L@@ est perhaps the people change their minds when they see war , and they return to Egypt " ;
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swear , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled ; and the heart of Phar@@ aoh and of his servants was changed towards the people , and they said , " What is this we have done , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? "
Moses said to the people , " Don '@@ t be afraid . stand still , and see the salvation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he will work for you today : for the Egyptians whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
I , behold , I will har@@ den the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Phar@@ aoh , and over all his armies , over his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and over his hor@@ sem@@ en .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the waters returned , and covered the ch@@ ari@@ ots and the hor@@ sem@@ en , even all Phar@@ aoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the horses of Phar@@ aoh went in with his ch@@ ari@@ ots and with his hor@@ sem@@ en into the sea , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea .
they took their journey from Eli@@ m , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of S@@ in , which is between Eli@@ m and Sinai , on the fif@@ teenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , " What is it ? " for they did@@ n '@@ t know what it was . Moses said to them , " It is the bread which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you to eat . "
all the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of S@@ in , by their journeys , according to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's commandment , and enc@@ amped in Rep@@ hi@@ dim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
therefore the people quar@@ rel@@ ed with Moses , and said , " Gi@@ ve us water to drink . " Moses said to them , " Why do you quarrel with me ? why do you test Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
the people were thir@@ sty for water there ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
now Je@@ thr@@ o , the priest of Mi@@ dian , Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , how that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had brought Israel out of Egypt .
Moses went out to meet his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and bowed and kis@@ sed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Je@@ thr@@ o said , " Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Phar@@ aoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
when Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw all that he did to the people , he said , " What is this thing that you do for the people ? why do you sit alone , and all the people stand around you from morning to evening ? "
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
Moses went up to God , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were th@@ un@@ ders and light@@ nings , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and the sound of an exceedingly loud trum@@ pet ; and all the people who were in the camp trem@@ bled .
" you shall not co@@ vet your neighbor 's house . you shall not co@@ vet your neighbor 's wife , nor his male servant , nor his female servant , nor his ox , nor his don@@ key , nor anything that is your neighbor 's . "
all the people perceived the thunder@@ ings , the light@@ nings , the sound of the trum@@ pet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trem@@ bled , and stayed at a distance .
but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie f@@ allow , that the poor of your people may eat ; and what they leave the animal of the field shall eat . in the same way , you shall deal with your viney@@ ard and with your olive gro@@ ve .

he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Come up to me on the mountain , and stay here , and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written , that you may teach them . "
" they shall make an ark of ac@@ ac@@ ia wood . its length shall be two and a half cub@@ its , its breadth a cub@@ it and a half , and a cub@@ it and a half its height .

Aaron said to them , " Take off the golden rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . "
for they said to me , ' Make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
I said to them , ' Who@@ ever has any gold , let them take it off : ' so they gave it to me ; and I threw it into the fire , and out came this cal@@ f . "

the children of Israel saw Moses ' face , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
they came , everyone whose heart stirred him up , and everyone whom his spirit made willing , and brought Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's offering , for the work of the T@@ ent of Meeting , and for all of its service , and for the holy garments .
they came , both men and women , as many as were willing @@@ -@@ @ hearted , and brought bro@@ o@@ ches , ear@@ rings , sig@@ net rings , and arm@@ lets , all jew@@ els of gold ; even every man who offered an offering of gold to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .

Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , " Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary . " so the people were restrained from bringing .

when Moses went into the T@@ ent of Meeting to speak with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the T@@ estim@@ ony , from between the two cher@@ ub@@ im : and he spoke to him .
Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Lev@@ ites . according to all that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Moses concerning the Lev@@ ites , so the children of Israel did to them .

those men said to him , " We are un@@ clean because of the dead body of a man . why are we kept back , that we may not offer the offering of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? "

it happened , when the ark went forward , that Moses said , " R@@ ise up , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h heard it , his anger was kind@@ led ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " G@@ ather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the T@@ ent of Meeting , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spirit which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yourself alone .
a wind from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went out and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cub@@ its above the surface of the earth .
he said , " He@@ ar now my words . if there is a prophet among you , I Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .

is it a small thing to you , that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and to stand before the congregation to minister to them ;
so they went away from the tent of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am came out , and stood at the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little ones .
but if Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h make a new thing , and the ground open its mouth , and swallow them up , with all that ap@@ per@@ tain to them , and they go down alive into She@@ ol ; then you shall understand that these men have desp@@ ised Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "

Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " P@@ ut back the rod of Aaron before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion ; that you may make an end of their mur@@ mur@@ ings against me , that they not die . "
your brothers also , the tribe of Lev@@ i , the tribe of your father , bring near with you , that they may be joined to you , and minister to you : but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony .
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the T@@ ent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Lev@@ ites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to do the service of the T@@ ent of Meeting .

Israel struck him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from the Ar@@ non to the Jab@@ bo@@ k , even to the children of Am@@ mon ; for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .

God came to Bal@@ a@@ am at night , and said to him , " If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . "
the don@@ key saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the don@@ key turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am struck the don@@ key , to turn her into the way .
the don@@ key said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " Am I not your don@@ key , on which you have ridden all your life long to this day ? was I ever in the habit of doing so to you ? " he said , " No . "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the princes of Bal@@ ak .

they brought the cap@@ tives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and to the congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Mo@@ ab , which are by the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Moses and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest took the gold of the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the T@@ ent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .

every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .
so I took the heads of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds , and cap@@ tains of fif@@ ties , and cap@@ tains of tens , and officers , according to your tribes .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us . "
and you mur@@ mu@@ red in your tents , and said , " Because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h hated us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the A@@ mor@@ ites , to destroy us .
where are we going up ? our brothers have made our heart to melt , saying , ' The people are greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the An@@ ak@@ im there . ' "
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Es@@ au , who dwell in Se@@ ir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
and the Av@@ vi@@ m , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Cap@@ ht@@ ori@@ m , who came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the valley of the Ar@@ non : behold , I have given into your hand Si@@ hon the A@@ mor@@ ite , king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and his land ; begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
( for only O@@ g king of Bash@@ an remained of the remn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im ; behold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is@@ n '@@ t it in Rab@@ ba@@ h of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cub@@ its was its length , and four cub@@ its its breadth , after the cub@@ it of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the valley of the Ar@@ non , and half the hill country of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and its cities , gave I to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ ad@@ ites :
J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h took all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , to the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites , and called them , even Bash@@ an , after his own name , Hav@@ vo@@ th J@@ air , to this day . )
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
beyond the Jordan , in the valley over against B@@ eth Pe@@ or , in the land of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who lived at H@@ esh@@ bon , whom Moses and the children of Israel struck , when they came forth out of Egypt .
these words Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more . he wrote them on two tables of stone , and gave them to me .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
but as for you , stand here by me , and I will tell you all the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordin@@ ances , which you shall teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it . "
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h s@@ wore to your fathers ,
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their al@@ t@@ ars , and d@@ ash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Ash@@ eri@@ m , and burn their engra@@ ved images with fire .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall burn the engra@@ ved images of their gods with fire . you shall not co@@ vet the silver or the gold that is on them , nor take it for yourself , lest you be sn@@ ared in it ; for it is an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " A@@ rise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a mol@@ ten image . "
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave them to me .
and you shall break down their al@@ t@@ ars , and d@@ ash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Ash@@ eri@@ m with fire ; and you shall cut down the engra@@ ved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age .
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may turn from the fierc@@ eness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your ne@@ edy , and to your poor , in your land .
you shall fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of your flock , and out of your thresh@@ ing floor , and out of your win@@ ep@@ ress ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
then you shall take an aw@@ l , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreigner , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the widow , who are within your gates .
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inqu@@ ire dilig@@ ently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ om@@ ination is done in Israel ,
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
this is according to all that you desired of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God in H@@ ore@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to possess it .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , ch@@ ari@@ ots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall tell them , " He@@ ar , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don '@@ t let your heart faint ; don '@@ t be afraid , nor trem@@ ble , neither be scared of them ;
what man is there who has planted a viney@@ ard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tri@@ but@@ ary to you , and shall serve you .
and the elders of that city shall bring down the hei@@ fer to a valley with running water , which is neither pl@@ owed nor s@@ own , and shall break the hei@@ fer 's neck there in the valley .
but he shall acknowledge the fir@@ st@@ born , the son of the hated , by giving him a double portion of all that he has ; for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the fir@@ st@@ born is his .
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebelli@@ ous , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glut@@ ton , and a drun@@ k@@ ard . "
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
and behold , he has accused her of shameful things , saying , ' I did@@ n '@@ t find in your daughter the tok@@ ens of vir@@ g@@ inity ; ' and yet these are the tok@@ ens of my daughter 's vir@@ g@@ inity . " they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
when you shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
when you reap your harvest in your field , and have forgot a she@@ af in the field , you shall not go again to get it : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow ; that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God may bless you in all the work of your hands .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
therefore it shall be , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around , in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it , that you shall b@@ lot out the memory of A@@ mal@@ ek from under the sky ; you shall not forget .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and pl@@ aster them with pl@@ aster :
'@@ Cur@@ sed is the man who makes an engra@@ ved or mol@@ ten image , an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the work of the hands of the cra@@ fts@@ man , and sets it up in secret . ' all the people shall answer and say , ' A@@ men . '
it shall happen , if you shall listen dilig@@ ently to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and over@@ take you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with b@@ light , and with mil@@ de@@ w ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall send against you , in hunger , and in thirst , and in n@@ ak@@ edness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a y@@ oke of iron on your neck , until he has destroyed you .
it shall happen that as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rejo@@ iced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be pl@@ ucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will sc@@ atter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and p@@ ining of soul ;
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the pl@@ agues of that land , and the sick@@ nesses with which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has made it sick ;
the secret things belong to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has driven you ,
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse : therefore choose life , that you may live , you and your seed ;
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither for@@ sake you : Don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . "
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
but Jes@@ hur@@ un grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sle@@ ek . then he for@@ s@@ ook God who made him , and lightly este@@ em@@ ed the Rock of his salvation .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrong@@ ly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not done all this . ' "
" see now that I , even I , am he , There is no god with me . I kill , and I make alive . I wound , and I heal . there is no one who can deliver out of my hand .
" go up into this mountain of Ab@@ ari@@ m , to Mount Ne@@ bo , which is in the land of Mo@@ ab , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and see the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and she said to the men , " I know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
for we have heard how Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h dried up the water of the Red Sea before you , when you came out of Egypt ; and what you did to the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who were beyond the Jordan , to Si@@ hon and to O@@ g , whom you utterly destroyed .
Joshua said , " Her@@ e@@ by you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Hit@@ tite , and the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , and the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite out from before you .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
he said , " No ; but I have come now as commander of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's army . " Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and wor@@ shipped , and said to him , " What does my lord say to his servant ? "
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trum@@ pets of r@@ ams ' horns before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h advanced , and blew the trum@@ pets ; and the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h followed them .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ resp@@ ass in the devoted things ; for Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
therefore the children of Israel can '@@ t stand before their enemies . they turn their backs before their enemies , because they have become devoted for destruction . I will not be with you any more , unless you destroy the devoted things from among you .
he brought near the family of Jud@@ ah ; and he selected the family of the Zer@@ ah@@ ites . he brought near the family of the Zer@@ ah@@ ites man by man , and Zab@@ di was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , was selected .
you shall do to A@@ i and her king as you did to Jer@@ ich@@ o and her king , except its spoil and its livestock , you shall take for a pl@@ under for yourselves . set an amb@@ ush for the city behind it . "
the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
as Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of un@@ cut stones , on which no man had lifted up any iron . they offered burnt offerings on it to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and sacrificed peace offerings .
they also resorted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ keys , and win@@ es@@ kins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gil@@ gal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a covenant with us . "
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the An@@ ak@@ im from the hill country , from He@@ br@@ on , from Deb@@ ir , from An@@ ab , and from all the hill country of Jud@@ ah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
in the hill country , and in the low@@ land , and in the Arab@@ ah , and in the slopes , and in the wilderness , and in the South ; the Hit@@ tite , the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite :
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Mis@@ re@@ pho@@ th M@@ aim , even all the Sid@@ onians ; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
and in the valley , B@@ eth Har@@ am , B@@ eth N@@ im@@ rah , S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , and Z@@ aph@@ on , the rest of the kingdom of Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon , the Jordan 's bank , to the utter@@ most part of the sea of Chin@@ ner@@ eth beyond the Jordan eastward .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah according to their families was to the border of E@@ dom , even to the wilderness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward , at the utter@@ most part of the south .
and it went out sou@@ th@@ ward of the ascent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and went up by the south of Kad@@ esh Bar@@ ne@@ a , and passed along by Hez@@ ron , went up to Ad@@ dar , and turned about to Kar@@ ka ;
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ eph@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ est@@ ward to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount j@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
she said , " Gi@@ ve me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o , at the waters of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the east , even the wilderness , going up from Jer@@ ich@@ o through the hill country to Be@@ the@@ l .
from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah the border went along w@@ est@@ ward to the bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families ;
they did@@ n '@@ t drive out the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in Ge@@ zer ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites dwell in the midst of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
this was the lot for the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph . as for Mach@@ ir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of Gil@@ e@@ ad , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gil@@ e@@ ad and Bash@@ an .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of H@@ ep@@ her , the son of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mach@@ ir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mah@@ lah , Noah , H@@ og@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
they came near before Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and before Joshua the son of N@@ un , and before the princes , saying , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers . " therefore according to the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .
the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , " Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance , since I am a great people , because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed me so far ? "
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Jud@@ ah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north , and went up through the hill country w@@ est@@ ward . it ended at the wilderness of B@@ eth A@@ ven .
out of the part of the children of Jud@@ ah was the inheritance of the children of Sim@@ eon ; for the portion of the children of Jud@@ ah was too much for them . therefore the children of Sim@@ eon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
they set apart K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee in the hill country of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , Sh@@ ec@@ hem in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) in the hill country of Jud@@ ah .
the rest of the children of Ko@@ hath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har , out of the tribe of Ash@@ er , out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Bash@@ an .
the children of Mer@@ ari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Re@@ ub@@ en , out of the tribe of G@@ ad , and out of the tribe of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n .
they gave to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the Lev@@ ites , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Golan in Bash@@ an with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the man@@ s@@ layer , and Be E@@ sh@@ ter@@ ah with its suburbs ; two cities .
" the Mi@@ ghty One , God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Mi@@ ghty One , God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he knows ; and Israel shall know : if it was in rebellion , or if in t@@ resp@@ ass against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ( don '@@ t save us this day ) ,
" far be it from us that we should rebel against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and turn away this day from following Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to build an altar for burnt offering , for meal offering , or for sacrifice , besides the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God that is before his tab@@ ern@@ acle ! "
the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and spoke no more of going up against them to war , to destroy the land in which the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad lived .
behold , I have allo@@ tted to you these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from the Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
" but if you do at all go back , and hold fast to the remn@@ ant of these nations , even these who remain among you , and make marriages with them , and go in to them , and they to you ;
Joshua said to all the people , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River , even Ter@@ ah , the father of Abraham , and the father of N@@ ah@@ or : and they served other gods .
it happened , when she came , that she got him to ask her father for a field : and she ali@@ ghted from off her don@@ key ; and Cal@@ eb said to her , " What would you like ? "
the wat@@ chers saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him , " Please show us the entrance into the city , and we will deal kindly with you . "
and they for@@ s@@ ook Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to anger .
yet they did@@ n '@@ t listen to their judges ; for they played the pro@@ stitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obe@@ ying the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . they did@@ n '@@ t do so .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h raised them up judges , then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was with the judge , and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it griev@@ ed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h because of their gro@@ aning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them .
but when the children of Israel cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h raised them up a s@@ avi@@ or , Ehud the son of Ger@@ a , the Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a man left @@@ -@@ @ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to E@@ gl@@ on the king of Mo@@ ab .
he said to them , " Fol@@ low me ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered your enemies the Mo@@ ab@@ ites into your hand . " they followed him , and took the For@@ ds of the Jordan against the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , and did@@ n '@@ t allow any man to pass over .
Bar@@ ak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
however S@@ is@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; for there was peace between Jab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
Ja@@ el went out to meet S@@ is@@ era , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don '@@ t be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inqui@@ res of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
those whose root is in A@@ mal@@ ek came out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Mach@@ ir . those who handle the marsh@@ al 's staff came out of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n .
and I said to you , " I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the A@@ mor@@ ites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the oak which was in O@@ ph@@ rah , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ rite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ ep@@ ress , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
it happened the same night , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Take your father 's bull , even the second bull seven years old , and throw down the altar of Ba@@ al that your father has , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah that is by it ;
and build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God on the top of this strongh@@ old , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Ash@@ er@@ ah which you shall cut down . "
behold , I will put a fle@@ ece of wool on the thresh@@ ing floor ; if there is de@@ w on the fle@@ ece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and enc@@ amped beside the spring of Har@@ od : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was on the north side of them , by the hill of More@@ h , in the valley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who b@@ ows down on his knees to drink . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " By the three hundred men who lap@@ ped will I save you , and deliver the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into your hand . let all the other people go , each to his own place . "
so the people took food in their hand , and their trum@@ pets ; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was beneath him in the valley .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
the three companies blew the trum@@ pets , and broke the p@@ itch@@ ers , and held the tor@@ ches in their left hands , and the trum@@ pets in their right hands with which to blow ; and they shouted , " The sword of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and of G@@ ide@@ on ! "
they blew the three hundred trum@@ pets , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h set every man 's sword against his fellow , and against all the army ; and the army fled as far as B@@ eth Sh@@ it@@ tah toward Zer@@ er@@ ah , as far as the border of A@@ bel Me@@ hol@@ ah , by Tab@@ bath .
the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said to him , " Why have you treated us this way , that you did@@ n '@@ t call us , when you went to fight with Mi@@ dian ? " they rebu@@ ked him sharply .
he said to the men of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , " Please give lo@@ aves of bread to the people who follow me ; for they are faint , and I am pursuing after Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , the kings of Mi@@ dian . "
now Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ k@@ or , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
he came to the men of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , and said , " See Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , concerning whom you ta@@ un@@ ted me , saying , ' Are the hands of Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na now in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are weary ? ' "
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Mill@@ o , and went and made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood on the top of Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " List@@ en to me , you men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may listen to you .
" the br@@ am@@ ble said to the trees , ' If in truth you ano@@ int me king over you , then come and take refuge in my shade ; and if not , let fire come out of the br@@ am@@ ble , and dev@@ our the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon . '
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sl@@ ain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ) ;
but if not , let fire come out from Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and dev@@ our the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and the house of Mill@@ o ; and let fire come out from the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and from the house of Mill@@ o , and dev@@ our Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h . "
Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
then Ze@@ bul said to him , " Now where is your mouth , that you said , ' Who is Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , that we should serve him ? ' is@@ n '@@ t this the people that you have desp@@ ised ? please go out now and fight with them . "
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
all the people likewise each cut down his b@@ ough , and followed Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and put them at the base of the strongh@@ old , and set the strongh@@ old on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
then he called hastily to the young man his armor be@@ arer , and said to him , " D@@ raw your sword , and kill me , that men not say of me , ' A woman killed him . ' his young man thrust him through , and he died . "
they troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year . for eighteen years , they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which is in Gil@@ e@@ ad .
Gil@@ e@@ ad 's wife bore him sons ; and when his wife 's sons grew up , they drove out J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and said to him , " You shall not inherit in our father 's house ; for you are the son of another woman . "
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah sent messengers to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
then the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over Gil@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
he struck them from A@@ ro@@ er until you come to Min@@ n@@ ith , even twenty cities , and to A@@ bel@@ cher@@ am@@ im , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Am@@ mon were subdued before the children of Israel .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and be@@ w@@ ail my vir@@ g@@ inity , I and my companions . "
when I saw that you did@@ n '@@ t save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites took the For@@ ds of the Jordan against the E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites . it was so , that when the fu@@ gi@@ tives of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said , " Let me go over , " the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad said to him , " Are you an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite ? " if he said , " No " ;
but he said to me , ' Be@@ hold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any un@@ clean thing ; for the child shall be a Naz@@ ir@@ ite to God from the womb to the day of his death . ' "
then Man@@ o@@ ah entre@@ ated Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Oh , Lord , please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Man@@ o@@ ah , " Th@@ ough you det@@ ain me , I won '@@ t eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " for Man@@ o@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t know that he was the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
so Man@@ o@@ ah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
but his wife said to him , " If Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h were pleased to kill us , he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand , neither would he have shown us all these things , nor would at this time have told such things as these . "
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ah of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the car@@ c@@ ass of the lion : and behold , there was a s@@ warm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
Sam@@ son said to them , " Let me tell you a rid@@ dle now . if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing ;
they spoke to him , saying , " No ; but we will bind you fast , and deliver you into their hand ; but surely we will not kill you . " they bound him with two new ropes , and brought him up from the rock .
he was very thir@@ sty , and called on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " You have given this great deliver@@ ance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ? "
she fast@@ ened it with the pin , and said to him , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are on you , Sam@@ son ! " he awakened out of his sleep , and pl@@ ucked away the pin of the beam , and the web .
she said , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are upon you , Sam@@ son ! " he aw@@ oke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he did@@ n '@@ t know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had departed from him .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fet@@ ters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
it happened , when their hearts were mer@@ ry , that they said , " Call for Sam@@ son , that he may entertain us . " they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
Sam@@ son called to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , remember me , please , and strengthen me , please , only this once , God , that I may be at once av@@ eng@@ ed of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines for my two eyes . "
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engra@@ ved image and a mol@@ ten image : and it was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
Mic@@ ah said to him , " D@@ well with me , and be to me a father and a priest , and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year , a suit of clothing , and your food . " so the Lev@@ ite went in .
then the five men who went to spy out the country of La@@ ish answered , and said to their brothers , " Do you know that there is in these houses an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and an engra@@ ved image , and a mol@@ ten image ? now therefore consider what you have to do . "
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engra@@ ved image : and Jonathan , the son of Ger@@ sh@@ om , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Dan@@ ites until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Ben@@ jam@@ ites .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the don@@ key ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
it was so , that all who saw it said , " There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day ! consider it , take counsel , and speak . "
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this w@@ ick@@ edness happen ? "
the children of Israel went up and we@@ pt before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h until evening ; and they asked of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Sh@@ all I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " Go up against him . "
and Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ az@@ ar , the son of Aaron , stood before it in those days ) , saying , " Sh@@ all I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother , or shall I cease ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " Go up ; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand . "
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most val@@ i@@ ant , and commanded them , saying , " Go and strike the inhabitants of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad with the edge of the sword , with the women and the little ones .
they found among the inhabitants of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ gins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ oh , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
they said , " Be@@ hold , there is a feast of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h from year to year in Sh@@ il@@ oh , which is on the north of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of Le@@ bon@@ ah . "
it happened in the days when the judges judged , that there was a famine in the land . a certain man of Bethlehem Jud@@ ah went to live in the country of Mo@@ ab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
they took them wives of the women of Mo@@ ab ; the name of the one was Or@@ pa@@ h , and the name of the other Ru@@ th : and they lived there about ten years .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kis@@ sed them , and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
so Na@@ omi returned , and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Mo@@ ab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess said to Na@@ omi , " Let me now go to the field , and g@@ lean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor . " she said to her , " Go , my daughter . "
she said , ' Please let me g@@ lean and gather after the re@@ apers among the she@@ aves . ' so she came , and has continued even from the morning until now , except that she stayed a little in the house . "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
it shall be , when he lies down , that you shall mark the place where he shall lie , and you shall go in , and un@@ cover his feet , and lay down ; then he will tell you what you shall do . "
now Bo@@ az went up to the gate , and sat down there . behold , the near kin@@ sman of whom Bo@@ az spoke came by ; to whom he said , " Come over here , friend , and sit down ! " he turned aside , and sat down .
then Bo@@ az said , " On the day you buy the field from the hand of Na@@ omi , you must buy it also from Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance . "
now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man took off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was the way of att@@ est@@ ation in Israel .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Na@@ omi " ; and they named him O@@ bed . he is the father of Jes@@ se , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim Z@@ op@@ him , of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of to@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite :
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a for@@ k of three teeth in his hand ;
yes , before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man who sacrificed , " Gi@@ ve meat to ro@@ ast for the priest ; for he will not accept boiled meat from you , but raw . "
the man of yours , whom I shall not cut off from my altar , shall consume your eyes , and gri@@ eve your heart ; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
therefore El@@ i said to Samuel , " Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Spe@@ ak , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for your servant hears . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the people had come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , " Why has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck us today before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? let us get the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h out of Sh@@ il@@ oh to us , that it may come among us , and save us out of the hand of our enemies . "
the man said to El@@ i , " I am he who came out of the army , and I fled today out of the army . " he said , " How did the matter go , my son ? "
he who brought the news answered , " Israel has fled before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people . your two sons also , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , are dead , and the ark of God has been captured . "
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
then they said , " What shall be the t@@ resp@@ ass offering which we shall return to him ? " they said , " Five golden tumors , and five golden mice , for the number of the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and take the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and lay it on the cart ; and put the jew@@ els of gold , which you return him for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering , in a coff@@ er by its side ; and send it away , that it may go .
the Lev@@ ites took down the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the coff@@ er that was with it , in which the jew@@ els of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don '@@ t cease to cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and they shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots ;
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the don@@ keys , and be anxious for us . "
then Saul said to his servant , " But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God . what do we have ? "
as for your don@@ keys who were lost three days ago , don '@@ t set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the hous@@ et@@ op , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
" you shall go down before me to Gil@@ gal ; and behold , I will come down to you , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : you shall wait seven days , until I come to you , and show you what you shall do . "
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophe@@ si@@ ed with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of K@@ ish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , " Where did you go ? " he said , " To seek the don@@ keys . when we saw that they were not found , we came to Samuel . "
Samuel said to all the people , " You see him whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? " all the people shouted , and said , " Let the king live ! "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
the elders of Jab@@ esh said to him , " Gi@@ ve us seven day , that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel ; and then , if there is no one to save us , we will come out to you . "
" but they forgot Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God ; and he sold them into the hand of S@@ is@@ era , captain of the army of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ ab ; and they fought against them .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but rebel against the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , then will the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be against you , as it was against your fathers .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a str@@ ait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in rocks , and in cover@@ ts , and in pits .
Samuel said , " What have you done ? " Saul said , " Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that you did@@ n '@@ t come within the days appointed , and that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines assembled themselves together at Mic@@ h@@ mash ;
therefore I said , ' Now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down on me to Gil@@ gal , and I haven '@@ t entre@@ ated the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the gar@@ rison , and the spo@@ il@@ ers , they also trem@@ bled ; and the earth qu@@ aked : so there was an exceeding great trembling .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor be@@ arer were not there .
it happened , while Saul talked to the priest , that the tum@@ ult that was in the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Saul said to the priest , " With@@ draw your hand ! "
the men of Israel were distressed that day ; for Saul had adju@@ red the people , saying , " Cur@@ sed is the man who eats any food until it is evening , and I am av@@ eng@@ ed of my enemies . " so none of the people t@@ asted food .
but Jonathan did@@ n '@@ t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in the honey@@ comb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then one of the people answered , and said , " Your father directly commanded the people with an oath , saying , ' Cur@@ sed is the man who eats food this day . ' " the people were faint .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ ish@@ ua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ ab , and the name of the younger Mic@@ h@@ al :
Saul said , " They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have gone the way which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent me , and have brought Ag@@ ag the king of A@@ mal@@ ek , and have utterly destroyed the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " Don '@@ t look on his face , or on the height of his stature ; because I have rejected him : for I see not as man sees ; for man looks at the outward appearance , but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h looks at the heart . "
let our lord now command your servants who are before you , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the har@@ p . it shall happen , when the evil spirit from God is on you , that he shall play with his hand , and you shall be well . "
David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jes@@ se had commanded him ; and he came to the place of the w@@ agons , as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , G@@ oli@@ ath by name , out of the ranks of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
David spoke to the men who stood by him , saying , " What shall be done to the man who kills this Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and takes away the repro@@ ach from Israel ? for who is this un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised Phil@@ ist@@ ine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ? "
David said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be with you . "
so David prevailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
when Saul saw David go forth against the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , he said to Ab@@ ner , the captain of the army , " Ab@@ ner , whose son is this youth ? " Ab@@ ner said , " As your soul lives , O king , I can '@@ t tell . "
David went out wherever Saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely : and Saul set him over the men of war , and it was good in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of Saul 's servants .
Saul was very angry , and this saying dis@@ pleased him ; and he said , " They have ascri@@ bed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascri@@ bed but thousands . what can he have more but the kingdom ? "
Saul said , " You shall tell David , ' The king desires no d@@ ow@@ ry except one hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to be av@@ eng@@ ed of the king 's enemies . ' " now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
Saul said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " Why have you deceived me thus , and let my enemy go , so that he is escaped ? " Mic@@ h@@ al answered Saul , " He said to me , ' Let me go ! why should I kill you ? ' "
David said to Jonathan , " Be@@ hold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
it happened on the next day after the new moon , the second day , that David 's place was empty . Saul said to Jonathan his son , " Why do@@ es@@ n '@@ t the son of Jes@@ se come to eat , neither yesterday , nor today ? "
then Saul 's anger was kind@@ led against Jonathan , and he said to him , " You son of a perverse rebelli@@ ous woman , don '@@ t I know that you have chosen the son of Jes@@ se to your own shame , and to the shame of your mother 's n@@ ak@@ edness ?
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kis@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , and David we@@ pt the most .
the servants of Ach@@ ish said to him , " is@@ n '@@ t this David the king of the land ? did@@ n '@@ t they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has sl@@ ain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was dis@@ cont@@ ented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Ben@@ jam@@ ites ! will the son of Jes@@ se give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
then A@@ him@@ elec@@ h answered the king , and said , " Who among all your servants is so faithful as David , who is the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and is taken into your council , and is honorable in your house ?
he struck No@@ b , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and don@@ keys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
David said to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , " I knew on that day , when Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father 's house .
will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as your servant has heard ? Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , I beg you , tell your servant . " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " He will come down . "
then David said , " Will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " They will deliver you up . "
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife Ab@@ ig@@ ail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was chur@@ lish and evil in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ eb .
she fell at his feet , and said , " On me , my lord , on me be the ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and please let your hand@@ maid speak in your ears . hear the words of your hand@@ maid .
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " Be@@ hold , your hand@@ maid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
then answered David and said to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the Hit@@ tite , and to Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , brother to Jo@@ ab , saying , " Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? " Ab@@ is@@ hai said , " I will go down with you . "
this thing is@@ n '@@ t good that you have done . as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , you are worthy to die , because you have not kept watch over your lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ano@@ inted . now see where the king 's spe@@ ar is , and the jar of water that was at his head . "
Ach@@ ish said , " Against whom have you made a raid today ? " David said , " Against the South of Jud@@ ah , against the South of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ elites , and against the South of the Ken@@ ites . "
moreover Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your hand@@ maid , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
they gave him a piece of a cake of fi@@ gs , and two clusters of ra@@ isin@@ s. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley , and those who were beyond the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they for@@ s@@ ook the cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
it happened after this , that David inqui@@ red of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Sh@@ all I go up into any of the cities of Jud@@ ah ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Go up . " David said , " Where shall I go up ? " he said , " To He@@ br@@ on . "
Ab@@ ner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but As@@ ah@@ el would not turn aside from following him .
David sent messengers to I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth , Saul 's son , saying , " Deli@@ ver me my wife Mic@@ h@@ al , whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the ears of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
then Jo@@ ab came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? behold , Ab@@ ner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
Saul 's son had two men who were cap@@ tains of bands : the name of the one was Ba@@ an@@ ah , and the name of the other Rec@@ hab , the sons of Rim@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , of the children of Benjamin ( for Be@@ ero@@ th also is reck@@ oned to Benjamin :
David commanded his young men , and they killed them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and han@@ ged them up beside the pool in He@@ br@@ on . but they took the head of I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth , and buried it in the grave of Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on .
David inqui@@ red of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Sh@@ all I go up against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to David , " Go up ; for I will certainly deliver the Phil@@ ist@@ ines into your hand . "
David arose , and went with all the people who were with him , from Ba@@ ale Jud@@ ah , to bring up from there the ark of God , which is called by the Name , even the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies who sits above the cher@@ ub@@ im .
it was so , as the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came into the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David le@@ aping and dancing before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
David said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " It was before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits ini@@ qu@@ ity , I will cha@@ sten him with the rod of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men ;
he struck Mo@@ ab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Mo@@ ab@@ ites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
of Syria , and of Mo@@ ab , and of the children of Am@@ mon , and of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and of A@@ mal@@ ek , and of the spoil of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er , son of Re@@ ho@@ b , king of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Zi@@ ba , and they called him to David ; and the king said to him , " Are you Zi@@ ba ? " he said , " Your servant is he . "
the king said , " Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may show the kindness of God to him ? " Zi@@ ba said to the king , " Jonathan has yet a son , who is lame of his feet . "
the king said to him , " Where is he ? " Zi@@ ba said to the king , " Be@@ hold , he is in the house of Mach@@ ir the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , in L@@ o deb@@ ar . "
David said to him , " Don '@@ t be afraid of him ; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father 's sake , and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father . you shall eat bread at my table continually . "
then Zi@@ ba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they were become o@@ dious to David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syrians of B@@ eth Re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syrians of Z@@ ob@@ ah , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah with one thousand men , and the men of To@@ b twelve thousand men .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ ab returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jerusalem .
when all the kings who were servants to Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er saw that they were defeated before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Am@@ mon any more .
when they had told David , saying , " Uri@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t go down to his house , " David said to Uri@@ ah , " Hav@@ en '@@ t you come from a journey ? why did@@ n '@@ t you go down to your house ? "
Na@@ than said to David , " You are the man . this is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , says : ' I ano@@ inted you king over Israel , and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul .
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bos@@ om , and gave you the house of Israel and of Jud@@ ah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
" this is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and ano@@ inted himself , and changed his clothing ; and he came into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and worshi@@ ped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he ate .
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
I , where would I carry my shame ? and as for you , you will be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , please speak to the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from you . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were vir@@ gins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sl@@ ain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
then she said , " Please let the king remember Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that the Av@@ enger of blood destroy not any more , lest they destroy my son . " he said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth . "
for we must die , and are as water split on the ground , which can '@@ t be gathered up again ; neither does God take away life , but dev@@ ises means , that he who is ban@@ ished not be an out@@ cast from him .
to change the face of the matter has your servant Jo@@ ab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
Jo@@ ab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Jo@@ ab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
then the king said to It@@ tai the G@@ it@@ tite , " Why do you also go with us ? return , and stay with the king ; for you are a foreigner , and also an exile . return to your own place .
all the country we@@ pt with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Z@@ ad@@ ok also came , and all the Lev@@ ites with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God ; and they set down the ark of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
the king said to Z@@ ad@@ ok , " Car@@ ry back the ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his hab@@ itation ;
when David was a little past the top , behold , Zi@@ ba the servant of M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth met him , with a couple of don@@ keys sadd@@ led , and on them two hundred lo@@ aves of bread , and one hundred clusters of ra@@ is@@ ins , and one hundred summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
the king said , " Where is your master 's son ? " Zi@@ ba said to the king , " Be@@ hold , he is staying in Jerusalem ; for he said , ' Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father . ' "
then the king said to Zi@@ ba , " Be@@ hold , all that per@@ tains to M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth is yours . " Zi@@ ba said , " I do obe@@ is@@ ance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have re@@ igned ! Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Ab@@ sal@@ om your son ! behold , you are caught by your own mis@@ chief , because you are a man of blood ! "
the king said , " What have I to do with you , you sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah ? because he cur@@ ses , and because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to him , ' Cur@@ se David ; ' who then shall say , ' Why have you done so ? ' "
Hus@@ hai said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " No ; but wh@@ om@@ ever Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " Go in to your father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , that he has left to keep the house . then all Israel will hear that you are ab@@ hor@@ red by your father . then the hands of all who are with you will be strong . "
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , ' Don '@@ t lodge this night at the For@@ ds of the wilderness , but by all means pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people who are with him . ' "
now Jonathan and A@@ him@@ a@@ az were staying by E@@ n Rog@@ el ; and a female servant used to go and tell them ; and they went and told king David . for they might not be seen to come into the city .
Ab@@ sal@@ om 's servants came to the woman to the house ; and they said , " Where are A@@ him@@ a@@ az and Jonathan ? " the woman said to them , " They have gone over the bro@@ ok of water . " when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
it happened , after they had departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David ; and they said to David , " A@@ rise and pass quickly over the water ; for thus has A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el counsel@@ ed against you . "
the king commanded Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai and It@@ tai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the cap@@ tains concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then A@@ him@@ a@@ az ran by the way of the Pl@@ ain , and outr@@ an the C@@ ush@@ ite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watch@@ man saw another man running ; and the watch@@ man called to the porter , and said , " Be@@ hold , a man running alone ! " the king said , " He also brings news . "
the watch@@ man said , " I think the running of the first one is like the running of A@@ him@@ a@@ az the son of Z@@ ad@@ ok . " the king said , " He is a good man , and comes with good news . "
the king said , " Is it well with the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om ? " A@@ him@@ a@@ az answered , " When Jo@@ ab sent the king 's servant , even me your servant , I saw a great tum@@ ult , but I don '@@ t know what it was . "
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . they told to all the people , saying , " Be@@ hold , the king is sitting in the gate . " all the people came before the king . now Israel had fled every man to his tent .
he bowed the heart of all the men of Jud@@ ah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Zi@@ ba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
a ferry boat went to bring over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . Shim@@ ei the son of Ger@@ a fell down before the king , when he had come over the Jordan .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why did@@ n '@@ t you go with me , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ? "
behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said to the king , " Why have our brothers the men of Jud@@ ah stolen you away , and brought the king , and his household , over the Jordan , and all David 's men with him ? "
they came and be@@ sieg@@ ed him in A@@ bel of B@@ eth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and they cast up a m@@ ound against the city , and it stood against the ram@@ part ; and all the people who were with Jo@@ ab batter@@ ed the wall , to throw it down .
and David said to the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , " What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make at@@ onement , that you may bless the inheritance of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us , and we will hang them up to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Saul , the chosen of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " the king said , " I will give them . "
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h the daughter of Ai@@ ah , whom she bore to Saul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ; and the five sons of Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Me@@ hol@@ ath@@ ite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , and they han@@ ged them in the mountain before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
and I@@ sh@@ bi@@ ben@@ ob , who was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spe@@ ar was three hundred she@@ k@@ els of brass in weight , he being armed with a new sword , thought to have sl@@ ain David .
but Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah helped him , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him . then the men of David s@@ wore to him , saying , " You shall go no more out with us to battle , that you don '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch the lamp of Israel . "
there was again war at G@@ ath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
after him was Sham@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of l@@ enti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was enc@@ amped in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he said , " Be it far from me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I should do this ! is@@ n '@@ t it the blood of the men who went in jeopar@@ dy of their lives ? " therefore he would not drink it . the three mighty men did these things .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ ab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goo@@ dly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and pl@@ ucked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spe@@ ar .
they passed over the Jordan , and enc@@ amped in A@@ ro@@ er , on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of G@@ ad , and to J@@ az@@ er :
Jo@@ ab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Jud@@ ah were five hundred thousand men .
Ara@@ un@@ ah said , " Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? " David said , " To buy your thresh@@ ing floor , to build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that the plague may be stopped from afflic@@ ting the people . "
Ara@@ un@@ ah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the thresh@@ ing instruments and the y@@ okes of the ox@@ en for the wood :
his father had not dis@@ pleased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
he has sl@@ ain cattle and fat@@ lings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest , and Jo@@ ab the captain of the army ; but he h@@ as@@ n '@@ t called Solomon your servant .
for he is gone down this day , and has sl@@ ain cattle and fat@@ lings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the king 's sons , and the cap@@ tains of the army , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest . behold , they are eating and drinking before him , and say , ' Long live king Ad@@ oni@@ jah ! '
most certainly as I s@@ wore to you by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , ' As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Jud@@ ah . "
so Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mu@@ le , and brought him to Gi@@ hon .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
it was told Solomon , saying , " Be@@ hold , Ad@@ oni@@ jah fears king Solomon ; for , behold , he has laid hold on the horns of the altar , saying , ' Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword . ' "
now therefore don '@@ t hold him guil@@ tless , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gray head down to She@@ ol with blood . "
Bath@@ she@@ ba therefore went to king Solomon , to speak to him for Ad@@ oni@@ jah . the king rose up to meet her , and bowed himself to her , and sat down on his throne , and caused a throne to be set for the king 's mother ; and she sat on his right hand .
it was told king Solomon , " Jo@@ ab has fled to the T@@ ent of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and behold , he is by the altar . " then Solomon sent Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , " Go , fall on him . "
Ben@@ aiah came to the T@@ ent of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said to him , " Th@@ us says the king , ' Come forth ! ' " he said , " No ; but I will die here . " Ben@@ aiah brought the king word again , saying , " Th@@ us said Jo@@ ab , and thus he answered me . "
the king said to him , " Do as he has said , and fall on him , and bury him ; that you may take away the blood , which Jo@@ ab shed without cause , from me and from my father 's house .
so shall their blood return on the head of Jo@@ ab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shim@@ ei ran away to Ach@@ ish , son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah , king of G@@ ath . they told Shim@@ ei , saying , " Be@@ hold , your servants are in G@@ ath . "
the other woman said , " No ; but the living is my son , and the dead is your son . " this said , " No ; but the dead is your son , and the living is my son . " thus they spoke before the king .
five cub@@ its was the one wing of the cher@@ u@@ b , and five cub@@ its the other wing of the cher@@ u@@ b : from the utter@@ most part of the one wing to the utter@@ most part of the other were ten cub@@ its .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of c@@ edar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the por@@ ch of the house .
there were nets of chec@@ ker work , and wre@@ aths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Hir@@ am made the basins , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the basins . so Hir@@ am made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h :
they brought up the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the T@@ ent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the T@@ ent ; even these the priests and the Lev@@ ites brought up .
there I have set a place for the ark , in which is the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
and he said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven above , or on earth beneath ; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make suppl@@ ication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ vers@@ ely ; we have dealt w@@ ick@@ edly ; '
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , two and twenty thousand head of cattle , and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
( now Hir@@ am the king of Ty@@ re had furnished Solomon with c@@ edar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hir@@ am twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ ilee .
as for all the people who were left of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a lev@@ y of bond@@ servants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bond@@ servants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots and of his hor@@ sem@@ en .
and the food of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their clothing , and his cup bearers , and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; there was no more spirit in her .
she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones . there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the army was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
then Phar@@ aoh said to him , " But what have you lacked with me , that behold , you seek to go to your own country ? " he answered , " No@@ thing , however only let me depart . "
the man J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am was a mighty man of val@@ or ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industri@@ ous , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cl@@ ad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
he said to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , " Take ten pieces ; for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Be@@ hold , I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to you
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the y@@ oke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
so the king did@@ n '@@ t listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he might establish his word , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Jud@@ ah , and the tribe of Benjamin , a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon .
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Jud@@ ah ; and they will kill me , and return to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Jud@@ ah . "
he went up to the altar which he had made in Be@@ the@@ l on the fif@@ teenth day in the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart : and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel , and went up to the altar , to burn inc@@ ense .
now there lived an old prophet in Be@@ the@@ l ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
for it was said to me by the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am said to his wife , " Please get up and disguise yourself , that you won '@@ t be recognized as the wife of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am . go to Sh@@ il@@ oh . behold , there is A@@ hij@@ ah the prophet , who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people .
for the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger .
for all the sins of Ba@@ asha , and the sins of E@@ lah his son , which they sin@@ ned , and with which they made Israel to sin , to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger with their van@@ ities .
he bought the hill Sam@@ aria of Sh@@ em@@ er for two talents of silver ; and he built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Sh@@ em@@ er , the owner of the hill , Sam@@ aria .
for he walked in all the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin , to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger with their van@@ ities .
in his days Hi@@ el the Beth@@ elite built Jer@@ ich@@ o : he laid its foundation with the loss of A@@ bir@@ am his fir@@ st@@ born , and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Se@@ gu@@ b , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by Joshua the son of N@@ un .
Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , who was of the foreigners of Gil@@ e@@ ad , said to A@@ hab , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , lives , before whom I stand , there shall not be de@@ w nor rain these years , but according to my word . "
so he arose and went to Z@@ are@@ ph@@ ath ; and when he came to the gate of the city , behold , a widow was there gathering sticks : and he called to her , and said , " Please get me a little water in a vessel , that I may drink . "
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel to Mount Car@@ me@@ l , and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Ba@@ al , and four hundred of the prophets of the Ash@@ er@@ ah , who eat at J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel 's table . "
Elijah said to the prophets of Ba@@ al , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
it was so , when mid@@ day was past , that they prophe@@ si@@ ed until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
then the fire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the t@@ rench .
he said to his servant , " Go up now , look toward the sea . " he went up , and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " he said , " Go again " seven times .
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
the prophet came near to the king of Israel , and said to him , " Go , strengthen yourself , and mark , and see what you do ; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you . "
but the rest fled to Ap@@ he@@ k , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand men who were left . Ben had@@ ad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
then he said to him , " Because you have not obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , behold , as soon as you are departed from me , a lion shall kill you . " as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and killed him .
he said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction , therefore your life shall go for his life , and your people for his people . ' "
it happened , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was st@@ oned , and was dead , that J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel said to A@@ hab , " A@@ rise , take possession of the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , which he refused to give you for money ; for Nab@@ o@@ th is not alive , but dead . "
A@@ hab said to Elijah , " Have you found me , my enemy ? " he answered , " I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
now the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah were sitting each on his throne , ar@@ ra@@ yed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets were proph@@ es@@ ying before them .
say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I come in peace . " ' "
the king of Israel said to Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " Su@@ rely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ hab , and all that he did , and the iv@@ ory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
he walked in all the way of As@@ a his father ; He did@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places .
A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah fell down through the lat@@ tice in his upper room that was in Sam@@ aria , and was sick . so he sent messengers , and said to them , " Go , inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al Ze@@ bu@@ b , the god of Ek@@ ron , whether I will recover of this sickness . "
Elijah said to Elis@@ ha , " Please wait here , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me as far as Be@@ the@@ l . " Elis@@ ha said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they went down to Be@@ the@@ l .
the sons of the prophets who were at Be@@ the@@ l came out to Elis@@ ha , and said to him , " Do you know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will take away your master from your head today ? " he said , " Yes , I know it ; hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Elis@@ ha , please wait here , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me to Jer@@ ich@@ o . " he said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o .
the sons of the prophets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o came near to Elis@@ ha , and said to him , " Do you know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will take away your master from your head today ? " he answered , " Yes , I know it . hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Please wait here , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me to the Jordan . " he said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " they both went on .
it happened , when they had gone over , that Elijah said to Elis@@ ha , " As@@ k what I shall do for you , before I am taken from you . " Elis@@ ha said , " Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me . "
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elis@@ ha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
the men of the city said to Elis@@ ha , " Be@@ hold , please , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land mis@@ carries . "
he went up from there to Be@@ the@@ l . as he was going up by the way , some youths came out of the city and mo@@ cked him , and said to him , " Go up , you Bal@@ dy ! go up , you bal@@ d@@ head ! "
now Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ ab was a sheep bre@@ eder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and of one hundred thousand r@@ ams .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Jud@@ ah , and the king of E@@ dom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , " is@@ n '@@ t there here a prophet of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that we may inqu@@ ire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h by him ? " one of the king of Israel 's servants answered , " Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at is here , who poured water on the hands of Elijah . "
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
please run now to meet her , and ask her , ' Is it well with you ? is it well with your husband ? is it well with the child ? ' " she answered , " It is well . "
Ge@@ haz@@ i passed on before them , and laid the staff on the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . therefore he returned to meet him , and told him , saying , " The child has not awakened . "
Elis@@ ha came again to Gil@@ gal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil ste@@ w for the sons of the prophets . "
but he said , " Then bring meal . " he cast it into the pot ; and he said , " P@@ our out for the people , that they may eat . " there was no harm in the pot .
his servant said , " What , should I set this before a hundred men ? " but he said , " Gi@@ ve the people , that they may eat ; for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' They will eat , and will have some left over . ' "
now Na@@ aman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of val@@ or , but he was a le@@ per .
it was so , when Elis@@ ha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
but Na@@ aman was angry , and went away , and said , " Be@@ hold , I thought , ' He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the le@@ per . '
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " W@@ on '@@ t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
when the servant of the man of God had risen early , and gone out , behold , an army with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots was around the city . his servant said to him , " Al@@ as , my master ! what shall we do ? "
when they came down to him , Elis@@ ha prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elis@@ ha .
it happened , when they had come into Sam@@ aria , that Elis@@ ha said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Sam@@ aria .
there was a great famine in Sam@@ aria . behold , they be@@ sieg@@ ed it , until a don@@ key 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a K@@ ab of do@@ ve 's d@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
Elis@@ ha said , " He@@ ar the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Tom@@ orrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a she@@ kel , and two measures of barley for a she@@ kel , in the gate of Sam@@ aria . ' "
they rose up in the tw@@ ilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
the people went out , and pl@@ under@@ ed the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a she@@ kel , and two measures of barley for a she@@ kel , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the king said to Haz@@ ael , " Take a present in your hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inqu@@ ire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h by him , saying , ' Will I recover from this sickness ? ' "
Haz@@ ael said , " But what is your servant , who is but a dog , that he should do this great thing ? " Elis@@ ha answered , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has shown me that you will be king over Syria . "
then Je@@ hu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said to him , " Is all well ? why did this mad fellow come to you ? " he said to them , " You know the man and what his talk was . "
now the watch@@ man was standing on the tower in J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , and he sp@@ ied the company of Je@@ hu as he came , and said , " I see a company . " Jor@@ am said , " Take a hor@@ sem@@ an , and send to meet them , and let him say , ' Is it peace ? ' "
then he sent out a second on horse@@ back , who came to them , and said , " Th@@ us says the king , ' Is it peace ? ' " Je@@ hu answered , " What do you have to do with peace ? fall in behind me ! "
therefore they came back , and told him . he said , " This is the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servant Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , saying , ' The dogs will eat the flesh of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel on the plot of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ,
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I con@@ spi@@ red against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
but Je@@ hu took no heed to walk in the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he did@@ n '@@ t depart from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin .
in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada sent and fetched the cap@@ tains over hundreds of the Car@@ ites and of the guard , and brought them to him into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and showed them the king 's son .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Su@@ r ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
then he brought out the king 's son , and put the crown on him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and ano@@ inted him ; and they cl@@ apped their hands , and said , " Long live the king ! "
nevertheless they did@@ n '@@ t depart from the sins of the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Ash@@ er@@ ah also in Sam@@ aria . )
for he did@@ n '@@ t leave to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz of the people any more than fifty hor@@ sem@@ en , and ten ch@@ ari@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in thresh@@ ing .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; he did@@ n '@@ t depart from all the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elis@@ ha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died : and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down to him , and we@@ pt over him , and said , " My father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ sem@@ en ! "
the man of God was angry with him , and said , " You should have struck five or six times . then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it , whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times . "
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent messengers to Je@@ ho@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the corner gate , four hundred cub@@ its .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as his fathers had done : he did@@ n '@@ t depart from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin .
this was the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to Je@@ hu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Men@@ a@@ hem exac@@ ted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , to give to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . so the king of As@@ sy@@ ria turned back , and did@@ n '@@ t stay there in the land .
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ria took Sam@@ aria , and carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ria , and placed them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of Go@@ zan , and in the cities of the Med@@ es .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watch@@ men to the fortified city ;
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and enchan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to provoke him to anger .
then the king of As@@ sy@@ ria commanded , saying , " Car@@ ry there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the law of the god of the land . "
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ab@@ i the daughter of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah : and he broke in pieces the bronze ser@@ pent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned inc@@ ense to it ; and he called it Ne@@ h@@ ush@@ tan .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of As@@ ap@@ h the recorder .
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have reb@@ elled against me ?
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ ah , said to Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , " Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it . Don '@@ t speak with us in the Jews ' language , in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
Don '@@ t listen to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah . ' for thus says the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone of you eat of his vine , and everyone of his fi@@ g tree , and everyone drink the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
where are the gods of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ pad ? where are the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim , of Hen@@ a , and Iv@@ v@@ ah ? have they delivered Sam@@ aria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
'@@ Th@@ us you shall speak to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying , " Don '@@ t let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like grain b@@ lasted before it has grown up .
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
then Isaiah the prophet came to king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and said to him , " What did these men say ? from where did they come to you ? " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said , " They have come from a far country , even from Babylon . "
I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Sam@@ aria , and the plum@@ met of the house of A@@ hab ; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wi@@ pes a dish , wi@@ ping it and turning it upside down .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Jud@@ ah ?
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Jo@@ si@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the scri@@ be , to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
" go up to Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " Hil@@ ki@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who have the oversight of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
" thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Jud@@ ah has read .
he brought out the Ash@@ er@@ ah from the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , outside of Jerusalem , to the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
as Jo@@ si@@ ah turned himself , he sp@@ ied the tom@@ bs that were there in the mountain ; and he sent , and took the bones out of the tom@@ bs , and burned them on the altar , and de@@ filed it , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these things .
surely there was not kept such a Pas@@ sover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Jud@@ ah ;
notwithstanding , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t turn from the fierc@@ eness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kind@@ led against Jud@@ ah , because of all the provocation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " I will remove Jud@@ ah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and I will cast off this city which I have chosen , even Jerusalem , and the house of which I said , ' My name shall be there . ' "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Jud@@ ah to destroy it , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had said .
all the men of might , even seven thousand , and the craftsmen and the s@@ mi@@ ths one thousand , all of them strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and enc@@ amped against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it around it .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , king of Babylon , came Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , to Jerusalem .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cub@@ its , and a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the capital was three cub@@ its , with network and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on the capital around it , all of brass : and like to these had the second pillar with network .
but it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the royal seed came , and ten men with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were with him at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
the sons of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah , Abraham 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : she bore Zim@@ ran , and Jo@@ k@@ shan , and Med@@ an , and Mi@@ dian , and I@@ sh@@ b@@ ak , and Shu@@ ah . the sons of Jo@@ k@@ shan : She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an .
but Aaron and his sons offered on the altar of burnt offering , and on the altar of inc@@ ense , for all the work of the most holy place , and to make at@@ onement for Israel , according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded .
the sons of Bel@@ a : E@@ z@@ bon , and Uz@@ zi , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th , and IR@@ I , five ; heads of fathers ' houses , mighty men of val@@ or ; and they were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand thirty @@@ -@@ @ four .
the sons of Bec@@ her : Zem@@ ir@@ ah , and Jo@@ ash , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Eli@@ o@@ en@@ ai , and Om@@ ri , and Jer@@ emo@@ th , and A@@ bi@@ jah , and An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , and Al@@ em@@ eth . all these were the sons of Bec@@ her .
and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pash@@ hu@@ r , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ jah , and Ma@@ as@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of J@@ ah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ em@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;

so Saul died for his t@@ resp@@ ass which he committed against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because of the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he did@@ n '@@ t keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inqu@@ ire ,
he was with David at Pas@@ dam@@ mi@@ m , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the three broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ,
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ ab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
of the G@@ ad@@ ites there separated themselves to David to the strongh@@ old in the wilderness , mighty men of val@@ or , men trained for war , that could handle shield and spe@@ ar ; whose faces were like the faces of lions , and they were as swift as the ro@@ es on the mountains ;
all these being men of war , who could order the battle array , came with a perfect heart to He@@ br@@ on , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
David went up , and all Israel , to Ba@@ al@@ ah , that is , to Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im , which belonged to Jud@@ ah , to bring up from there the ark of God Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that sits above the cher@@ ub@@ im , that is called by the Name .
and with them their brothers of the second degree , Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , Ben , and Ja@@ az@@ iel , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ ele@@ hu , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , the door@@ keepers .
and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ ele@@ hu , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , and Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah , with har@@ ps tuned to the eight @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ing@@ ed ly@@ re , to lead .
She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , and Jos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and A@@ mas@@ ai , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Ben@@ aiah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , the priests , blew the trum@@ pets before the ark of God : and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom and Je@@ hi@@ ah were door@@ keepers for the ark .
David was clo@@ thed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Lev@@ ites who bore the ark , and the singers , and Chen@@ ani@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ep@@ ho@@ d of linen .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
As@@ ap@@ h the chief , and second to him Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , J@@ ei@@ el , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and with har@@ ps ; and As@@ ap@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , sounding aloud ;
and with them h@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n with trum@@ pets and cy@@ mb@@ als for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n to be at the gate .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God .
King David also dedicated these to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ ab , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they had made themselves o@@ dious to David , H@@ anu@@ n and the children of Am@@ mon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en out of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , and out of Ar@@ am@@ ma@@ ac@@ ah , and out of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
there was again war at G@@ ath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .
Or@@ nan said to David , " Take it for yourself , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes . behold , I give the ox@@ en for burnt offerings , and the thresh@@ ing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meal offering . I give it all . "
behold , a son shall be born to you , who shall be a man of rest . I will give him rest from all his enemies all around ; for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and qui@@ et@@ ness to Israel in his days .
by weight also for the lam@@ p@@ stands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lamps ; and for the lam@@ p@@ stands of silver , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lam@@ p@@ stand ;
and for the altar of inc@@ ense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the ch@@ ari@@ ot , the cher@@ ub@@ im , that spread out , and covered the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ! " all the assembly blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and pro@@ str@@ ated themselves before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the king .
they sacrificed sacrifices to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and offered burnt offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bul@@ ls , one thousand r@@ ams , and one thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
Hur@@ am continued , " Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endowed with discretion and understanding , that should build a house for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and a house for his kingdom .
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
then Solomon began to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at Jerusalem on Mount M@@ ori@@ ah , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the thresh@@ ing floor of Or@@ nan the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
he made the most holy house : its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cub@@ its , and its breadth twenty cub@@ its ; and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
the wings of the cher@@ ub@@ im were twenty cub@@ its long : the wing of the one was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b .
the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cub@@ its , joining to the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b .
and the sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , and the basins , and the spo@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
" Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make suppl@@ ication to you in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , we have done per@@ vers@@ ely , and have dealt w@@ ick@@ edly ; '
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I coven@@ anted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
then I will pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sab@@ baths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , three times in the year , in the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
Hur@@ am sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to O@@ ph@@ ir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
the king made of the al@@ gum trees terraces for the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for the king 's house , and har@@ ps and str@@ ing@@ ed instruments for the singers : and there were none like these seen before in the land of Jud@@ ah .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a foot@@ stool of gold , which were fast@@ ened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
it happened , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
'@@ Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " You shall not go up , nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house ; for this thing is of me . " ' " so they listened to the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and returned from going against J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
now Sh@@ em@@ aiah the prophet came to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and to the princes of Jud@@ ah , who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Sh@@ is@@ hak , and said to them , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You have for@@ s@@ aken me , therefore have I also left you in the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak . ' "
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saw that they hum@@ bled themselves , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Sh@@ em@@ aiah , saying , " They have hum@@ bled themselves . I will not destroy them ; but I will grant them some deliver@@ ance , and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests with the trum@@ pets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don '@@ t fight against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers ; for you shall not prosper . "
then As@@ a brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben had@@ ad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Jud@@ ah , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him mighty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
now the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah sat each on his throne , ar@@ ra@@ yed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets were proph@@ es@@ ying before them .
the messenger who went to call Mic@@ aiah spoke to him , saying , " Be@@ hold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth . let your word therefore , please be like one of theirs , and speak good . "
and say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I return in peace . " ' "
the king of Israel said to Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
and he said , " List@@ en , all Jud@@ ah , and you inhabitants of Jerusalem , and you king Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at . thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to you , ' Don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Zi@@ z . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jer@@ u@@ el .
when he had taken counsel with the people , he appointed those who should sing to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and give praise in holy array , as they went out before the army , and say , Gi@@ ve thanks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for his loving kindness endu@@ res forever .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ ab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Se@@ ir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , everyone helped to destroy another .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ hab ; for he had the daughter of A@@ hab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the pro@@ stitute , like the house of A@@ hab did , and also have sl@@ ain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
thirty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned in Jerusalem eight years : and he departed without being desired ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tom@@ bs of the kings .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest brought out the cap@@ tains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " B@@ ring her out between the ranks ; and whoever follows her , let him be sl@@ ain with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don '@@ t kill her in the Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house . "
he gathered together the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and said to them , " Go out to the cities of Jud@@ ah , and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year . see that you exped@@ ite this matter . " however the Lev@@ ites did@@ n '@@ t do it right away .
but the men of the army whom Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell on the cities of Jud@@ ah , from Sam@@ aria even to B@@ eth Hor@@ on , and struck of them three thousand , and took much spoil .
therefore the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Ama@@ zi@@ ah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah consulted his advisers , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
he built towers in the wilderness , and dug out many ci@@ ster@@ ns , for he had much livestock ; in the low@@ land also , and in the plain : and he had farmers and viney@@ ard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields ; for he loved farming .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah had an army of fighting men , who went out to war by bands , according to the number of their reckoning made by J@@ ei@@ el the scri@@ be and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the officer , under the hand of Han@@ ani@@ ah , one of the king 's cap@@ tains .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a le@@ per . " Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ igned in his place .
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
then some of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ z@@ ki@@ ah the son of Sh@@ all@@ um , and A@@ mas@@ a the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against those who came from the war ,
A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he made him al@@ t@@ ars in every corner of Jerusalem .
for our fathers have t@@ resp@@ assed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ s@@ aken him , and have turned away their faces from the hab@@ itation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to clean@@ se it , and brought out all the un@@ clean@@ ness that they found in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple into the court of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the Lev@@ ites took it , to carry it out abroad to the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they went in to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleans@@ ed all the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
he set the Lev@@ ites in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and with har@@ ps , according to the commandment of David , and of G@@ ad the king 's se@@ er , and Na@@ than the prophet ; for the commandment was of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h by his prophets .
moreover He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king and the princes commanded the Lev@@ ites to sing pra@@ ises to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of As@@ ap@@ h the se@@ er . they sang pra@@ ises with gl@@ ad@@ ness , and they bowed their heads and worshi@@ ped .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sancti@@ fied themselves : therefore the Lev@@ ites were in charge of killing the Pas@@ so@@ vers for everyone who was not clean , to sancti@@ fy them to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah spoke comfortably to all the Lev@@ ites who had good understanding in the service of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . so they ate throughout the feast for the seven days , offering sacrifices of peace offerings , and making confession to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
all the assembly of Jud@@ ah , with the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Jud@@ ah , rejo@@ iced .
the children of Israel and Jud@@ ah , who lived in the cities of Jud@@ ah , they also brought in the ti@@ the of cattle and sheep , and the ti@@ the of dedicated things which were consec@@ rated to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
besides those who were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy of males , from three years old and upward , even everyone who entered into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as the duty of every day required , for their service in their offices according to their divisions ;
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the bro@@ ok that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of As@@ sy@@ ria come , and find much water ? "
do@@ es@@ n '@@ t He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ? '
h@@ as@@ n '@@ t the same He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah taken away his high places and his al@@ t@@ ars , and commanded Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , saying , ' You shall worship before one altar , and on it you shall burn inc@@ ense ? '
Don '@@ t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ ghten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
thus Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saved He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
for he built again the high places which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his father had broken down ; and he re@@ ared up al@@ t@@ ars for the Ba@@ als , and made Ash@@ ero@@ th , and worshi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and did@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twel@@ fth year he began to purge Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Ash@@ eri@@ m , and the engra@@ ved images , and the mol@@ ten images .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had pur@@ ged the land and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the recorder , to repair the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God .
so Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to H@@ ul@@ d@@ ah the proph@@ et@@ ess , the wife of Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Tok@@ hath , the son of Has@@ rah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Jud@@ ah .
his princes gave for a fre@@ e@@ will offering to the people , to the priests , and to the Lev@@ ites . Hil@@ ki@@ ah and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah and Je@@ hi@@ el , the rulers of God 's house , gave to the priests for the Pas@@ sover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock , and three hundred head of cattle .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they ro@@ asted the Pas@@ sover with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was prepared the same day , to keep the Pas@@ sover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to the commandment of king Jo@@ si@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ om@@ inations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ igned in his place .
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
" thus says Cy@@ rus king of Persia , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of heaven , has given me all the king@@ doms of the earth ; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Jud@@ ah .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which is in Jerusalem .
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the builders laid the foundation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , they set the priests in their clothing with trum@@ pets , with the Lev@@ ites the sons of As@@ ap@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , to praise Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to the directions of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Lev@@ ites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
then Re@@ h@@ um the chancellor , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and the rest of their companions , the Din@@ a@@ ites , and the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ath@@ ch@@ ites , the Tar@@ pel@@ ites , the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ sites , the Arch@@ ev@@ ites , the Bab@@ yl@@ onians , the Sh@@ us@@ han@@ ch@@ ites , the De@@ ha@@ ites , the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
then when the copy of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and their companions , they went in ha@@ ste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
now the prophets , H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Id@@ do , prophe@@ si@@ ed to the Jews who were in Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophe@@ si@@ ed to them .
the elders of the Jews built and prosper@@ ed , through the proph@@ es@@ ying of H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Id@@ do . they built and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the decree of Cy@@ rus , and D@@ arius , and Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes king of Persia .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the rest of the children of the cap@@ tivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bul@@ ls , two hundred r@@ ams , four hundred lam@@ bs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Lev@@ ites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and kept the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread seven days with joy : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had made them joyful , and had turned the heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria to them , to strengthen their hands in the work of God 's house , the God of Israel .
this E@@ z@@ ra went up from Babylon : and he was a ready scri@@ be in the law of Moses , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , had given ; and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God on him .
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes the king .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Lev@@ ites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bul@@ ls , r@@ ams , lam@@ bs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for J@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and for M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , who were teachers .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass . "
then were assembled to me everyone who trem@@ bled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their t@@ resp@@ ass of the cap@@ tivity ; and I sat conf@@ ounded until the evening offering .
it happened in the month N@@ is@@ an , in the twentieth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tom@@ bs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
I said to the king , " If it pleas@@ es the king , and if your servant has found favor in your sight , that you would send me to Jud@@ ah , to the city of my fathers ' tom@@ bs , that I may build it . "
the king said to me ( the queen was also sitting by him ) , " For how long shall your journey be ? and when will you return ? " so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it griev@@ ed them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
the rulers did@@ n '@@ t know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
then I said to them , " You see the evil case that we are in , how Jerusalem lies waste , and its gates are burned with fire . come , let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we won '@@ t be dis@@ grac@@ ed . "
I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me , as also of the king 's words that he had spoken to me . they said , " Let 's rise up and build . " so they strengthened their hands for the good work .
then answered I them , and said to them , " The God of heaven will prosper us . therefore we , his servants , will arise and build ; but you have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem . "
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sancti@@ fied it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Ham@@ me@@ ah they sancti@@ fied it , to the tower of Han@@ an@@ el .
next to them , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of Uri@@ ah , the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z made repairs . next to them , M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ z@@ ab@@ el made repairs . next to them , Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana made repairs .
now Tob@@ i@@ ah the Am@@ mon@@ ite was by him , and he said , " What they are building , if a fox climbed up it , he would break down their stone wall . "
but it happened that when San@@ ball@@ at , Tob@@ i@@ ah , the Arab@@ ians , the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ d@@ ites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
I said to the no@@ bles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
please restore to them , even this day , their fields , their vineyards , their olive gro@@ ves , and their houses , also the hundre@@ d@@ th part of the money , and of the grain , the new wine , and the oil , that you are charging them . "
then they said , " We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do , even as you say . " then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they would do according to this promise .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can '@@ t come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Jud@@ ah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
" remember , my God , Tob@@ i@@ ah and San@@ ball@@ at according to these their works , and also the proph@@ et@@ ess No@@ adi@@ ah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear . "
of the priests : the children of Hob@@ aiah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the daughters of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite , and was called after their name .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand dar@@ ics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until mid@@ day , in the presence of the men and the women , and of those who could understand ; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law .
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the great God . all the people answered , " A@@ men , A@@ men , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshi@@ ped Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with their faces to the ground .
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves boo@@ ths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and found his heart faithful before you , and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Hit@@ tite , the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , to give it to his seed , and have performed your words ; for you are righteous .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursu@@ ers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover you gave them king@@ doms and peoples , which you allo@@ tted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Si@@ hon , even the land of the king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an .
" so the children went in and possessed the land , and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and gave them into their hands , with their kings , and the peoples of the land , that they might do with them as they pleased .
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem ; but in the cities of Jud@@ ah everyone lived in his possession in their cities : Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Pash@@ hu@@ r , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ jah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fathers ' households , two hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and Am@@ ash@@ s@@ ai the son of Az@@ arel , the son of Ah@@ zai , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah the son of Mic@@ a , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of As@@ ap@@ h , who was the chief to begin the thank@@ s@@ giving in prayer , and Bak@@ bu@@ ki@@ ah , the second among his brothers ; and Ab@@ da the son of Sham@@ mu@@ a , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n .
the over@@ se@@ er also of the Lev@@ ites at Jerusalem was Uz@@ zi the son of B@@ ani , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the son of M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ a , of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h , the singers , over the business of God 's house .
these were in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jes@@ hua , the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and in the days of Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah the governor , and of E@@ z@@ ra the priest the scri@@ be .
then I brought up the princes of Jud@@ ah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the d@@ ung gate ;
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ ab@@ ite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
I commanded the Lev@@ ites that they should puri@@ fy themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sancti@@ fy the Sabbath day . remember to me , my God , this also , and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was mer@@ ry with wine , he commanded Me@@ human , Biz@@ tha , Har@@ bon@@ a , B@@ ig@@ tha , and Ab@@ ag@@ tha , Z@@ eth@@ ar , and Car@@ c@@ ass , the seven e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who served in the presence of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us the king ,
Mem@@ uc@@ an answered before the king and the princes , " V@@ ash@@ ti the queen has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the princes , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us commanded V@@ ash@@ ti the queen to be brought in before him , but she did@@ n '@@ t come . '
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ esh , who were door@@ keepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
then Es@@ ther called for H@@ ath@@ ach , one of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Es@@ ther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
the king said to Es@@ ther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
if I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request , let the king and Ham@@ an come to the banquet that I will prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king has said . "
Ham@@ an recoun@@ ted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
the king said , " What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mor@@ dec@@ ai for this ? " then the king 's servants who attended him said , " No@@ thing has been done for him . "
the king said , " Who is in the court ? " now Ham@@ an had come into the outer court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about hanging Mor@@ dec@@ ai on the g@@ allows that he had prepared for him .
then the king said to Ham@@ an , " Hur@@ ry and take the clothing and the horse , as you have said , and do this for Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , who sits at the king 's gate . let nothing fail of all that you have spoken . "
then Ham@@ an took the clothing and the horse , and ar@@ ra@@ yed Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and had him ride through the city square , and proclaimed before him , " Th@@ us shall it be done to the man whom the king deli@@ ghts to honor ! "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ enge themselves on their enemies .
Mor@@ dec@@ ai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a robe of fine linen and purple ; and the city of Sus@@ a shouted and was glad .
but the Jews who were in Sh@@ ush@@ an assembled together on the thir@@ teenth and on the four@@ teenth days of the month ; and on the fif@@ teenth day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
therefore they called these days " Pur@@ im , " from the word " P@@ ur . " therefore because of all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and that which had come to them ,
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to which the king advanced him , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
haven '@@ t you made a hedge around him , and around his house , and around all that he has , on every side ? you have blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
while he was still speaking , there also came another , and said , " The fire of God has fallen from the sky , and has burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " The Chal@@ de@@ ans made three bands , and swept down on the cam@@ els , and have taken them away , yes , and killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
he said , " N@@ aked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has taken away . blessed be the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
but he said to her , " You speak as one of the foolish women would speak . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? " in all this Job did@@ n '@@ t sin with his lips .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
yes , he would have all@@ ured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fat@@ ness .

that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
then I returned and saw all the op@@ pressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that w@@ ick@@ edness is stupidity , and that fool@@ is@@ hness is madness .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hard@@ ness of his face is changed .
then I commended mir@@ th , because a man has no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be joyful : for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun .
for man also do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are , even so are the sons of men sn@@ ared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .

from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no sound@@ ness in it : wounds , wel@@ ts , and open so@@ res . they haven '@@ t been closed , neither band@@ aged , neither soo@@ thed with oil .
therefore the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the Mi@@ ghty One of Israel , says : " Ah , I will get relief from my adversaries , and av@@ enge myself of my enemies ;
for there will be a day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies for all that is proud and ha@@ u@@ ghty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
in that day , men shall cast away their idols of silver , and their idols of gold , which have been made for themselves to worship , to the mol@@ es and to the b@@ ats ;
as for my people , children are their op@@ pres@@ sors , and women rule over them . my people , those who lead you cause you to er@@ r , and destroy the way of your paths .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will enter into judgment with the elders of his people , and their leaders : " it is you who have eaten up the viney@@ ard . the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
now I will tell you what I will do to my viney@@ ard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tram@@ pled down .
for the viney@@ ard of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is the house of Israel , and the men of Jud@@ ah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him ha@@ sten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
their ro@@ aring will be like a lion@@ ess . they will ro@@ ar like young lions . yes , they shall ro@@ ar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
then I said , " W@@ oe is me ! for I am un@@ done , because I am a man of un@@ clean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of un@@ clean lips : for my eyes have seen the King , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ! "
it happened in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , that Re@@ zin the king of Syria , and Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Isaiah , " Go out now to meet A@@ haz , you , and S@@ hear@@ j@@ ash@@ u@@ b your son , at the end of the condu@@ it of the upper pool , on the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
tell him , ' Be careful , and keep calm . Don '@@ t be afraid , neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking tor@@ ches , for the fierce anger of Re@@ zin and Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
it will happen in that day that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will whistle for the fly that is in the utter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ria .
it will sweep on@@ ward into Jud@@ ah . it will over@@ flow and pass through ; it will reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land , Im@@ manuel .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his shoulders . his name will be called Won@@ der@@ ful , Coun@@ sel@@ or , Mi@@ ghty God , Ever@@ lasting Father , Prince of Peace .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Z@@ ion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the will@@ ful proud heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and the in@@ sol@@ ence of his ha@@ u@@ ghty looks .
for he has said , " By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom ; for I have understanding : and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples , and have robbed their treasures . like a val@@ i@@ ant man I have brought down their rulers .
it will come to pass in that day that the remn@@ ant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
therefore the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , says " My people who dwell in Z@@ ion , don '@@ t be afraid of the As@@ sy@@ rian , though he strike you with the rod , and lift up his staff against you , as Egypt did .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies will stir up a scourge against him , as in the slaughter of Mi@@ dian at the rock of O@@ re@@ b . his rod will be over the sea , and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt .
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his y@@ oke from off your neck , and the y@@ oke shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's land for servants and for hand@@ m@@ aids . they will take as cap@@ tives those whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
Don '@@ t rejoice , O Phil@@ is@@ tia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the ser@@ pent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying ser@@ pent .
for the fields of H@@ esh@@ bon langu@@ ish with the vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to J@@ az@@ er , which wan@@ dered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
yet g@@ lean@@ ings will be left there , like the shaking of an olive tree , two or three oli@@ ves in the top of the up@@ per@@ most b@@ ough , four or five in the ou@@ ter@@ most branches of a fruitful tree , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the for@@ s@@ aken places in the woods and on the mountain top , which were for@@ s@@ aken from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a des@@ ol@@ ation .
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebu@@ ke them , and they will flee far off , and will be ch@@ ased like the cha@@ ff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whir@@ ling dust before the storm .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I will be still , and I will see in my dwelling place , like clear heat in sunshine , like a cloud of de@@ w in the heat of harvest . "
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h because of op@@ pres@@ sors , and he will send them a s@@ avi@@ or and a defender , and he will deliver them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and will perform it .
he will surely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the ch@@ ari@@ ots of your glory will be , you shame of your lord 's house .
and I will clo@@ the him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Jud@@ ah .
" in that day , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " the nail that was fast@@ ened in a sure place will give way . it will be cut down , and fall . the burden that was on it will be cut off , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will visit Ty@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the king@@ doms of the world on the surface of the earth .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you are my God . I will ex@@ alt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faith@@ fulness and truth .
he has swallowed up death forever ! the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will wipe away tears from off all faces . he will take the repro@@ ach of his people away from off all the earth , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " Be@@ hold , this is our God ! we have waited for him , and he will save us ! this is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! we have waited for him . we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation ! "
your dead shall live . my dead bodies shall arise . awake and sing , you who dwell in the dust ; for your de@@ w is like the de@@ w of herbs , and the earth will cast forth the dead .
behold , the Lord has a mighty and strong one . like a storm of hail , a destroying storm , and like a storm of mighty waters over@@ flowing , he will cast them down to the earth with his hand .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be thresh@@ ing it . although he drives the wheel of his thresh@@ ing cart over it , his horses don '@@ t gr@@ ind it .
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will wait , that he may be gr@@ acious to you ; and therefore he will be exalted , that he may have mercy on you , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is a God of justice . blessed are all those who wait for him .
you shall def@@ ile the over@@ laying of your engra@@ ved images of silver , and the pl@@ ating of your mol@@ ten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an un@@ clean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gl@@ ad@@ ness of heart , as when one goes with a fl@@ ute to come to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h stretches out his hand , both he who helps shall stum@@ ble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consumed together .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
look at Z@@ ion , the city of our appointed festivals . your eyes will see Jerusalem , a quiet hab@@ itation , a tent that won '@@ t be removed . its stakes will never be pl@@ ucked up , nor will any of its cor@@ ds be broken .
your ri@@ gging is unti@@ ed . they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t strengthen the foot of their m@@ ast . they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t spread the sail . then the prey of a great spoil was divided . the lame took the prey .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's sword is filled with blood . it is covered with fat , with the blood of lam@@ bs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of r@@ ams ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has a sacrifice in Bo@@ z@@ rah , And a great slaughter in the land of E@@ dom .
it will blos@@ som ab@@ und@@ antly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Car@@ me@@ l and Sharon . they will see Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's glory , the excellence of our God .
tell those who have a fearful heart , " Be strong . Don '@@ t be afraid . behold , your God will come with vengeance , God 's re@@ tribution . he will come and save you .
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Eli@@ ak@@ im , She@@ b@@ na and Jo@@ ah said to Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , " Please speak to your servants in Ar@@ am@@ aic , for we understand it ; and don '@@ t speak to us in the Jews ' language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " He@@ ar the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria !
Don '@@ t listen to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , for thus says the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and each of you eat from his vine , and each one from his fi@@ g tree , and each one of you drink the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of As@@ ap@@ h , the recorder , came to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
Isaiah said to them , " Tell your master , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Don '@@ t be afraid of the words that you have heard , with which the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
behold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
" thus you shall speak to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying , ' Don '@@ t let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went out and struck one hundred and eighty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand men in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ rians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
in those days was He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sick and near death . Isaiah the prophet , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , came to him , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Set your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
and said , " Rem@@ ember now , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt bit@@ terly .
then Isaiah the prophet came to king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and asked him , " What did these men say ? where did they come from to you ? " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said , " They have come from a country far from me , even from Babylon . "
the voice of one saying , " C@@ ry ! " one said , " What shall I cry ? " " all flesh is like grass , and all its glory is like the flower of the field .
he who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot . he seeks a skillful work@@ man to set up an engra@@ ved image for him that will not be moved .

" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar , and as the pot@@ ter t@@ reads clay .
but this is a robbed and pl@@ under@@ ed people . all of them are sn@@ ared in holes , and they are hidden in prisons . they have become a prey , and no one delivers ; and a spoil , and no one says , ' Restore them ! '
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " and I am God .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wear@@ ied me with your ini@@ qu@@ ities .
one will say , ' I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jacob ; and another will write with his hand ' to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' and honor the name of Israel . "
who is like me ? who will call , and will declare it , and set it in order for me , since I established the ancient people ? let them declare the things that are coming , and that will happen .

I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
Dis@@ til , you heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness . let the earth open , that it may bring forth salvation , and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it . I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have created it .
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will make straight all his ways . he shall build my city , and he shall let my ex@@ iles go free , not for price nor reward , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
I have not spoken in secret , in a place of the land of darkness . I did@@ n '@@ t say to the seed of Jacob , ' Se@@ ek me in vain . ' I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , speak righteousness . I declare things that are right .

awake , awake , stand up , Jerusalem , that have drunk at the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the cup of his wrath ; you have drun@@ ken the bowl of the cup of staggering , and drained it .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
thus says your Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and your God who ple@@ ads the cause of his people , " Be@@ hold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering , even the bowl of the cup of my wrath ; you shall no more drink it again :
for you shall not go out in ha@@ ste , neither shall you go by flight : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
" Don '@@ t be afraid ; for you shall not be ashamed : neither be conf@@ ounded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the shame of your youth ; and the repro@@ ach of your wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood you shall remember no more .

for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my covenant of peace be removed , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who has mercy on you .
behold , you shall call a nation that you don '@@ t know ; and a nation that did@@ n '@@ t know you shall run to you , because of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he has glori@@ fied you . "
for you shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing ; and all the trees of the fields shall cl@@ ap their hands .
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar ; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples . "
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shep@@ herds who can '@@ t understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .

then you shall call , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , ' Here I am . ' " if you take away from the midst of you the y@@ oke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking w@@ ick@@ edly ;
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your daughters shall be carried in the arms .

you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , am your Savior , and your Re@@ deem@@ er , the Mi@@ ghty One of Jacob .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " Su@@ rely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have lab@@ ored :

thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one says , ' Don '@@ t destroy it , for a blessing is in it : ' so will I do for my servants ' sake , that I may not destroy them all .
so that he who bl@@ esses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he who sw@@ ears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hidden from my eyes .
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contr@@ ite spirit , and who trem@@ bles at my word .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the nations like an over@@ flowing stream : and you will nurse . you will be carried on her side , and will be d@@ and@@ led on her knees .

behold , I have this day set you over the nations and over the king@@ doms , to pl@@ uck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow , to build and to plant . "
for , behold , I will call all the families of the king@@ doms of the north , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Jud@@ ah .
for , behold , I have made you this day a fortified city , and an iron pillar , and bronze walls , against the whole land , against the kings of Jud@@ ah , against its princes , against its priests , and against the people of the land .
now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shi@@ h@@ or ? or what have you to do in the way to As@@ sy@@ ria , to drink the waters of the River ?
" your own w@@ ick@@ edness shall correct you , and your back@@ sliding shall re@@ prove you . know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter , that you have for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and that my fear is not in you , " says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
" lift up your eyes to the bare heights , and see ! where have you not been lain with ? you have sat for them by the ways , as an Arabian in the wilderness . you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your w@@ ick@@ edness .
moreover , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the king , " Have you seen that which back@@ sliding Israel has done ? she has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree , and there has played the pro@@ stitute .
I saw , when , for this very cause that back@@ sliding Israel had committed adul@@ tery , I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce , yet treach@@ erous Jud@@ ah , her sister , did@@ n '@@ t fear ; but she also went and played the pro@@ stitute .
in those days the house of Jud@@ ah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
" if you will return , Israel , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " if you will return to me , and if you will put away your ab@@ om@@ inations out of my sight ; then you shall not be removed ;
and you shall swear , ' As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
circum@@ c@@ ise yourselves to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and take away the fores@@ kins of your heart , you men of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem ; lest my wrath go forth like fire , and burn so that none can qu@@ en@@ ch it , because of the evil of your do@@ ings .
a lion is gone up from his th@@ icket , and a destro@@ yer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land des@@ ol@@ ate , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabit@@ ant .
my angu@@ ish , my angu@@ ish ! I am p@@ ained at my very heart ; my heart is dis@@ qui@@ eted in me ; I can '@@ t hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my soul , the sound of the trum@@ pet , the alarm of war .
therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them , a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them , a le@@ op@@ ard shall watch against their cities ; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces ; because their trans@@ gres@@ sions are many , and their back@@ sliding is increased .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies said , " C@@ ut down trees , and cast up a m@@ ound against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Stand in the ways and see , and ask for the old paths , ' Where is the good way ? ' and walk in it , and you will find rest for your souls . but they said , ' We will not walk in it . '
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
they take hold of bow and spe@@ ar . they are cruel , and have no mercy . their voice ro@@ ars like the sea , and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Z@@ ion . "
they have built the high places of T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I did@@ n '@@ t command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that it shall no more be called T@@ oph@@ eth , nor The valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , but The valley of S@@ laughter : for they shall bury in T@@ oph@@ eth , until there is no place to bury .
were they ashamed when they had committed ab@@ om@@ ination ? n@@ ay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they bl@@ ush : therefore shall they fall among those who fall ; in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall be cast down , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they bend their tongue , as their bow , for false@@ hood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from evil to evil , and they don '@@ t know me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .

they are like a palm tree , of turned work , and don '@@ t speak : they must be carried , because they can '@@ t go . Don '@@ t be afraid of them ; for they can '@@ t do evil , neither is it in them to do good . "
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it ap@@ per@@ tains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from Up@@ haz , the work of the arti@@ fic@@ er and of the hands of the g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith ; blue and purple for their clothing ; they are all the work of skillful men .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don '@@ t know you , and on the families that don '@@ t call on your name : for they have dev@@ oured Jacob , yes , they have dev@@ oured him and consumed him , and have laid waste his hab@@ itation .
they are turned back to the ini@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fathers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Jud@@ ah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
then shall the cities of Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer inc@@ ense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Jud@@ ah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up al@@ t@@ ars to the shameful thing , even al@@ t@@ ars to burn inc@@ ense to Ba@@ al .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , who planted you , has pronounced evil against you , because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Jud@@ ah , which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering inc@@ ense to Ba@@ al .
destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h dev@@ ours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
they have s@@ own wheat , and have re@@ aped thor@@ ns ; they have put themselves to pain , and profit nothing : and you shall be ashamed of your fruits , because of the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .

what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sor@@ rows take hold of you , as of a woman in trav@@ ail ?
I have seen your ab@@ om@@ inations , even your adul@@ ter@@ ies , and your neigh@@ ing , the le@@ w@@ dness of your prostitution , on the hills in the field . w@@ oe to you , Jerusalem ! you will not be made clean ; how long shall it yet be ?
you hope of Israel , its Savior in the time of trouble , why should you be as a foreigner in the land , and as a way@@ far@@ ing man who turns aside to stay for a night ?
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering , I will not accept them ; but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
you shall say this word to them , Let my eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very griev@@ ous wound .
I will cause them to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the king@@ doms of the earth , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the son of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
I have win@@ now@@ ed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they did@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
their wid@@ ows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destro@@ yer at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused angu@@ ish and terr@@ ors to fall on her suddenly .
she who has borne seven langu@@ ishes ; she has given up the spirit ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day ; she has been disappointed and conf@@ ounded : and their resi@@ due will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , Most certainly I will strengthen you for good ; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make suppl@@ ication to you in the time of evil and in the time of afflic@@ tion .
behold , I will send for many fishermen , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and they shall fish them up ; and afterward I will send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the cle@@ fts of the rocks .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , my strength , and my strongh@@ old , and my refuge in the day of afflic@@ tion , to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies , van@@ ity and things in which there is no profit .
let them be disappointed who persec@@ ute me , but let not me be disappointed ; let them be dis@@ may@@ ed , but don '@@ t let me be dis@@ may@@ ed ; bring on them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David , riding in ch@@ ari@@ ots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and this city shall remain forever .
but if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy , and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day ; then will I kind@@ le a fire in its gates , and it shall dev@@ our the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
because they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have e@@ strang@@ ed this place , and have burned inc@@ ense in it to other gods , that they did@@ n '@@ t know , they and their fathers and the kings of Jud@@ ah ; and have filled this place with the blood of inno@@ cents ,
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is with me as an awesome mighty one : therefore my persec@@ utors shall stum@@ ble , and they shall not prevail ; they shall be utterly disappointed , because they have not dealt wisely , even with an everlasting dis@@ honor which shall never be forgotten .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : execute justice and righteousness , and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the op@@ pres@@ sor : and do no wrong , do no violence , to the foreigner , the fa@@ ther@@ less , nor the widow ; neither shed innocent blood in this place .
inhabit@@ ant of Lebanon , who makes your nest in the c@@ ed@@ ars , how greatly to be p@@ iti@@ ed you will be when p@@ ang@@ s come on you , the pain as of a woman in trav@@ ail !
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies concerning the prophets : behold , I will feed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is un@@ god@@ liness gone forth into all the land .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pl@@ uck them up .
I will even give them up to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the king@@ doms of the earth for evil ; to be a repro@@ ach and a prover@@ b , a ta@@ unt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
it shall happen , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and I will make it des@@ ol@@ ate forever .
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the U@@ z , and all the kings of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ kel@@ on , and Gaza , and Ek@@ ron , and the remn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the king@@ doms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sh@@ esh@@ ach shall drink after them .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , Be@@ hold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great storm shall be raised up from the utter@@ most parts of the earth .
w@@ ail , you shep@@ herds , and cry ; and wal@@ low in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your disper@@ sions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goo@@ dly vessel .
it happened , when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall surely die .
Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ ash@@ tite prophe@@ si@@ ed in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ; and he spoke to all the people of Jud@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : Z@@ ion shall be pl@@ owed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become he@@ aps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Uri@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my out@@ stretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
but as for you , don '@@ t you listen to your prophets , nor to your div@@ in@@ ers , nor to your dreams , nor to your soo@@ th@@ say@@ ers , nor to your sorcer@@ ers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon :
why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the resi@@ due of the vessels that are left in this city ,
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Han@@ ani@@ ah the son of A@@ zz@@ ur , the prophet , who was of Gi@@ be@@ on , spoke to me in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
and I will bring again to this place J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , king of Jud@@ ah , with all the cap@@ tives of Jud@@ ah , who went to Babylon , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for I will break the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon .
now these are the words of the letter that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the resi@@ due of the elders of the cap@@ tivity , and to the priests , to the prophets , and to all the people , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon ,
because they have worked folly in Israel , and have committed adul@@ tery with their neighbors ' wives , and have spoken words in my name fal@@ sely , which I did@@ n '@@ t command them ; and I am he who knows , and am witness , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for I am with you , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to save you : for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you , but I will not make a full end of you ; but I will correct you in measure , and will in no way leave you un@@ punished .
they shall come with we@@ eping ; and with peti@@ tions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a straight way in which they shall not stum@@ ble ; for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
I have surely heard E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im b@@ emo@@ aning himself thus , You have ch@@ asti@@ sed me , and I was ch@@ asti@@ sed , as an un@@ trained cal@@ f : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pl@@ uck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to aff@@ l@@ ict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will put my law in their inward parts , and in their heart will I write it ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who gives the sun for a light by day , and the ordin@@ ances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , who stir@@ s up the sea , so that its waves ro@@ ar ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name :
and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , the son of Mah@@ se@@ i@@ ah , in the presence of Han@@ am@@ el my uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses who subscri@@ bed the deed of the purchase , before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard .
who show loving kindness to thousands , and re@@ comp@@ ense the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers into the bos@@ om of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name ;
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Jud@@ ah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
I will clean@@ se them from all their ini@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will pardon all their ini@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
the word which came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the king@@ doms of the earth that were under his dom@@ inion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , Go , and speak to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and tell him , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and you shall not escape out of his hand , but shall surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth , and you shall go to Babylon .
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a He@@ bre@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bond@@ servants of them , of a Jew his brother .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age , saying ,
you had now turned , and had done that which is right in my eyes , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
behold , I will command , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Jud@@ ah a des@@ ol@@ ation , without inhabit@@ ant .
but it happened , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
then Jer@@ emi@@ ah called Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah ; and Bar@@ uch wrote from the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
then read Bar@@ uch in the book the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in the room of G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , the scri@@ be , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house , in the ears of all the people .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Bar@@ uch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
so the king sent Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elis@@ h@@ ama the scri@@ be . Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
it happened , when Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the pen@@ knife , and cast it into the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Jud@@ ah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will bring on them , and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and on the men of Jud@@ ah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them , but they did@@ n '@@ t listen .
when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the guard was there , whose name was I@@ ri@@ jah , the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah , the son of Han@@ ani@@ ah ; and he laid hold on Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , saying , You are falling away to the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and fetched him : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , There is . he said also , You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king commanded , and they committed Jer@@ emi@@ ah into the court of the guard ; and they gave him daily a lo@@ af of bread out of the b@@ akers ' street , until all the bread in the city was spent . thus Jer@@ emi@@ ah remained in the court of the guard .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; but he who goes forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
then took they Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and cast him into the dun@@ geon of Mal@@ chi@@ jah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jer@@ emi@@ ah with cor@@ ds . in the dun@@ geon there was no water , but mire ; and Jer@@ emi@@ ah sank in the mire .
now when E@@ bed@@ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian , a e@@ un@@ uch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the dun@@ geon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , They shall not deliver you . obey , I beg you , the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your soul shall live .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursued after them , and over@@ took Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon to Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; and he gave judgment on him .
they sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
the word which came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , after that Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the cap@@ tives of Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an s@@ wore to them and to their men , saying , Don '@@ t be afraid to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Mo@@ ab , and among the children of Am@@ mon , and in E@@ dom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h ; and there they ate bread together in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
and said to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , Please let our suppl@@ ication be presented before you , and pray for us to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , even for all this remn@@ ant ; for we are left but a few of many , as your eyes do see us :
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God .
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pl@@ uck you up ; for I gri@@ eve over the distress that I have brought on you .
Don '@@ t be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don '@@ t be afraid of him , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trum@@ pet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
it happened that , when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Jud@@ ah ;
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : you have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem , and on all the cities of Jud@@ ah ; and behold , this day they are a des@@ ol@@ ation , and no man d@@ wells therein ,
because of their w@@ ick@@ edness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn inc@@ ense , to serve other gods , that they did@@ n '@@ t know , neither they , nor you , nor your fathers .
therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth , and was kind@@ led in the cities of Jud@@ ah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and des@@ ol@@ ate , as it is this day .
when we burned inc@@ ense to the queen of the sky , and poured out drink offerings to her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings to her , without our husbands ?
the message that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet spoke to Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
you shall tell him , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pl@@ uck up ; and this in the whole land .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and let the mighty men go forth : C@@ ush and P@@ ut , who handle the shield ; and the Lu@@ dim , who handle and bend the bow .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like cal@@ ves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they did@@ n '@@ t stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their vis@@ itation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall become an over@@ flowing stream , and shall over@@ flow the land and all that is therein , the city and those who dwell therein ; and the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall w@@ ail .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers don '@@ t look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to cut off from Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on every hel@@ per who remains : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will destroy the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , the remn@@ ant of the is@@ le of Cap@@ h@@ tor .
the praise of Mo@@ ab is no more ; in H@@ esh@@ bon they have devised evil against her : come , and let us cut her off from being a nation . you also , mad@@ men , shall be brought to silence : the sword shall pursue you .
Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
with more than the we@@ eping of J@@ az@@ er will I we@@ ep for you , vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of J@@ az@@ er : on your summer fruits and on your v@@ intage the destro@@ yer is fallen .
from the cry of H@@ esh@@ bon even to Ele@@ al@@ eh , even to Ja@@ haz have they uttered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even to Hor@@ on@@ aim , to E@@ gl@@ ath Shel@@ is@@ hi@@ yah : for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim also shall become des@@ ol@@ ate .
he who fle@@ es from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring on him , even on Mo@@ ab , the year of their vis@@ itation , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
w@@ ail , H@@ esh@@ bon , for A@@ i is laid waste ; cry , you daughters of Rab@@ ba@@ h , clo@@ the yourself in s@@ ack@@ cloth : lam@@ ent , and run back and forth among the fences ; for Mal@@ cam shall go into cap@@ tivity , his priests and his princes together .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bo@@ z@@ rah : and the heart of the mighty men of E@@ dom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her p@@ ang@@ s .
I will cause EL@@ AM to be dis@@ may@@ ed before their enemies , and before those who seek their life ; and I will bring evil on them , even my fierce anger , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them ;
cut off the s@@ ower from Babylon , and him who handles the sick@@ le in the time of harvest : for fear of the op@@ pressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
in those days , and in that time , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the ini@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Jud@@ ah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remn@@ ant .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you wer@@ en '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , I am against you , you proud one , says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ; for your day has come , the time that I will visit you .
a sword is on their horses , and on their ch@@ ari@@ ots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
they lay hold on bow and spe@@ ar ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice ro@@ ars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her ini@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's vengeance ; he will render to her a re@@ comp@@ ense .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : for@@ sake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shi@@ elds : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Med@@ es ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the vengeance of his temple .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sworn by himself , saying , Su@@ rely I will fill you with men , as with the can@@ ker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
set up a standard in the land , blow the trum@@ pet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the king@@ doms of Ar@@ ar@@ at , Min@@ ni , and Ash@@ ken@@ az : appoint a marsh@@ al against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough can@@ ker worm .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engra@@ ved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be conf@@ ounded ; and all her sl@@ ain shall fall in the midst of her .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the peoples shall labor for van@@ ity , and the nations for the fire ; and they shall be weary .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , king of Babylon , came Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cub@@ its , with network and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me des@@ ol@@ ate and faint all the day .
Z@@ ion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an un@@ clean thing .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Z@@ ion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They h@@ iss and gn@@ ash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Cer@@ tain@@ ly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried to the Lord : wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Gi@@ ve yourself no resp@@ ite ; don '@@ t let the apple of your eye cease .
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My vir@@ gins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of So@@ dom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river Che@@ bar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a repro@@ ver ; for they are a rebelli@@ ous house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with fear@@ fulness ; and they shall drink water by measure , and in dis@@ may :
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has reb@@ elled against my ordin@@ ances in doing w@@ ick@@ edness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordin@@ ances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ atter to all the winds .
thus shall my anger be accomplished , and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest , and I shall be comfor@@ ted ; and they shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken in my zeal , when I have accomplished my wrath on them .
so it shall be a repro@@ ach and a ta@@ unt , an instruction and an aston@@ ishment , to the nations that are around you , when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath , and in w@@ ra@@ thful rebu@@ kes ; ( I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it ; )
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : strike with your hand , and stamp with your foot , and say , Al@@ as ! because of all the evil ab@@ om@@ inations of the house of Israel ; for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
he who is far off shall die of the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is be@@ sieg@@ ed shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your ab@@ om@@ inations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your ab@@ om@@ inations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , do strike .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ esty ; but they made the images of their ab@@ om@@ inations and their det@@ est@@ able things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an un@@ clean thing .
mis@@ chief shall come on mis@@ chief , and rum@@ or shall be on rum@@ or ; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
the king shall mour@@ n , and the prince shall be clo@@ thed with des@@ ol@@ ation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled : I will do to them after their way , and according to their own judgments will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , nor@@ th@@ ward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Ja@@ az@@ ani@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , every man with his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of inc@@ ense went up .
then he said to me , Son of man , have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in his rooms of imagery ? for they say , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see us ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has for@@ s@@ aken the land .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cher@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clo@@ thed in linen , who had the writer 's ink@@ horn by his side .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the fore@@ heads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the ab@@ om@@ inations that are done in its midst .
the cher@@ u@@ b stretched forth his hand from between the cher@@ ub@@ im to the fire that was between the cher@@ ub@@ im , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clo@@ thed in linen , who took it and went out .
therefore say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : whereas I have removed them far off among the nations , and whereas I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their det@@ est@@ able things and their ab@@ om@@ inations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the dark , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , because he shall not see the land with his eyes .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; that they may declare all their ab@@ om@@ inations among the nations where they come ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
tell them therefore , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will make this prover@@ b to cease , and they shall no more use it as a prover@@ b in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
for I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall be performed ; it shall be no more deferred : for in your days , rebelli@@ ous house , will I speak the word , and will perform it , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
so will I break down the wall that you have pl@@ ast@@ ered with whit@@ ew@@ ash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : w@@ oe to the women who se@@ w pil@@ lows on all el@@ b@@ ows , and make ker@@ chiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls ! will you hunt the souls of my people , and save souls alive for yourselves ?
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : as the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your v@@ aulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jew@@ els ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of your sister So@@ dom : pride , full@@ ness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : a great eagle with great wings and long fe@@ athers , full of fe@@ athers , which had various colors , came to Lebanon , and took the top of the c@@ edar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a wil@@ low tree .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his t@@ resp@@ ass that he has t@@ resp@@ assed against me .
what do you mean , that you use this prover@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has de@@ filed his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
neither has wrong@@ ed any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
yet you say , Why do@@ es@@ n '@@ t the son bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the father ? when the son has done that which is lawful and right , and has kept all my statutes , and has done them , he shall surely live .
but it was pl@@ ucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit : its strong rods were broken off and with@@ ered ; the fire consumed them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : in this moreover have your fathers bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me , in that they have committed a t@@ resp@@ ass against me .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sancti@@ fied in you in the sight of the nations .
you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
it is given to be furb@@ ished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpen@@ ed , yes , it is furb@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
while they see for you false visions , while they divine lies to you , to lay you on the nec@@ ks of the wicked who are deadly wounded , whose day has come in the time of the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the end .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , skillful to destroy .
son of man , the house of Israel has become d@@ ross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the d@@ ross of silver .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ g@@ inity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
thus will I make your le@@ w@@ dness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gn@@ aw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it : it shall happen , and I will do it : I will not go back , neither will I spare , neither will I repent ; according to your ways , and according to your do@@ ings , shall they judge you , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their enc@@ amp@@ ments in you , and make their dwell@@ ings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
they shall make a spoil of your riches , and make a prey of your merchandise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleasant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters .
they shall take up a lam@@ entation over you , and tell you , How you are destroyed , who were inhabited by seaf@@ aring men , the renowned city , who was strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , who caused their terror to be on all who lived there !
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : when I shall make you a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
and tell Ty@@ re , you who dwell at the entry of the sea , who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands , thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : you , Ty@@ re , have said , I am perfect in beauty .
when your wa@@ res went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall def@@ ile your brightness .
by the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you with violence , and you have sin@@ ned : therefore I have cast you as prof@@ ane out of the mountain of God ; and I have destroyed you , covering cher@@ u@@ b , from the midst of the stones of fire .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against you , Sid@@ on ; and I will be glori@@ fied in the midst of you ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sancti@@ fied in her .
for I will send pesti@@ l@@ ence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
there shall be no more a pr@@ icking bri@@ er to the house of Israel , nor a hurting thor@@ n of any that are around them , that scor@@ ned them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will put hoo@@ ks in your j@@ aws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales ; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Sev@@ en@@ eh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
all the birds of the sky made their ne@@ sts in its b@@ ough@@ s ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
the c@@ ed@@ ars in the garden of God could not hide it ; the f@@ ir trees were not like its b@@ ough@@ s , and the plane trees were not as its branches ; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty .
when I shall extingu@@ ish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
yes , I will make many peoples amazed at you , and their kings shall be horri@@ bly afraid for you , when I shall bran@@ dish my sword before them ; and they shall trem@@ ble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of your fall .
when I shall make the land of Egypt des@@ ol@@ ate and waste , a land des@@ tit@@ ute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
there is E@@ dom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are sl@@ ain by the sword : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with those who go down to the pit .
I will make the land a des@@ ol@@ ation and an aston@@ ishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , so that none shall pass through .
as for you , son of man , the children of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another , everyone to his brother , saying , Please come and hear what is the word that comes forth from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don '@@ t do them .
as a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad , so will I seek out my sheep ; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the water@@ courses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good past@@ ure ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat past@@ ure shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
I will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
as you rejo@@ iced over the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was des@@ ol@@ ate , so will I do to you : you shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , Mount Se@@ ir , and all E@@ dom , even all of it ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I don '@@ t do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my holy name , which you have prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , where you went .
I will sancti@@ fy my great name , which has been prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , which you have prof@@ an@@ ed in their midst ; and the nations shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall be sancti@@ fied in you before their eyes .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have built the ruined places , and planted that which was des@@ ol@@ ate : I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed fe@@ asts , so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ locks of men ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore proph@@ esy , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two king@@ doms any more at all ;
and I will turn you around , and put hoo@@ ks into your j@@ aws , and I will bring you forth , with all your army , horses and hor@@ sem@@ en , all of them clo@@ thed in full armor , a great company with Buck@@ ler and shield , all of them handling s@@ words ;
with pesti@@ l@@ ence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hor@@ des , and on the many peoples who are with him , an over@@ flowing shower , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and sulfur .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be prof@@ an@@ ed any more : and the nations shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One in Israel .
they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , in that I caused them to go into cap@@ tivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and twentieth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the four@@ teenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me there .
every lodge was one re@@ ed long , and one re@@ ed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lo@@ dges was five cub@@ its ; and the threshold of the gate by the por@@ ch of the gate toward the house was one re@@ ed .
the windows of it , and its arch@@ es , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arch@@ es were before them .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok , who from among the sons of Lev@@ i come near to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to minister to him .
then he brought me to the por@@ ch of the house , and measured each post of the por@@ ch , five cub@@ its on this side , and five cub@@ its on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cub@@ its on this side , and three cub@@ its on that side .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cub@@ its ; and the inner temple , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cher@@ ub@@ im and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the por@@ ch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
he measured it on the four sides : it had a wall around it , the length five hundred , and the breadth five hundred , to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall clean@@ se it and make at@@ onement for it .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having oversight at the gates of the house , and minist@@ ering in the house : they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister to them .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of a Hom@@ er : its measure shall be after the Hom@@ er .
and one lamb of the flock , out of two hundred , from the well @@@ -@@ @ wat@@ ered past@@ ures of Israel@@ -@@ -@@ for a meal offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make at@@ onement for them , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without bl@@ emish ; and you shall clean@@ se the sanctuary .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fif@@ teenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
you shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning , the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h , and the third part of a H@@ in of oil , to moist@@ en the fine flour ; a meal offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h continually by a perpetual ordin@@ ance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part w@@ est@@ ward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from E@@ n G@@ ed@@ i even to E@@ n E@@ gl@@ aim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
the east side , between H@@ aur@@ an and Damascus and Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the land of Israel , shall be the Jordan ; from the [ north ] border to the east sea you shall measure . this is the east side .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sancti@@ fied of the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok , who have kept my instruction , who did@@ n '@@ t go astr@@ ay when the children of Israel went astr@@ ay , as the Lev@@ ites went astr@@ ay .
the five thousand that are left in the breadth , in front of the twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand , shall be for common use , for the city , for dwelling and for suburbs ; and the city shall be in its midst .
the remainder in the length , answ@@ er@@ able to the holy offering , shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand w@@ est@@ ward ; and it shall be answ@@ er@@ able to the holy offering ; and its increase shall be for food to those who labor in the city .
moreover from the possession of the Lev@@ ites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Jud@@ ah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's d@@ ain@@ ties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
I thank you , and praise you , you God of my fathers , who have given me wisdom and might , and have now made known to me what we desired of you ; for you have made known to us the king 's matter .
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen here@@ after ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king sent to gather together the sat@@ rap@@ s , the deputies , and the governors , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the counsel@@ ors , the sh@@ eri@@ ffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king had set up .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn , fl@@ ute , zi@@ ther , ly@@ re , har@@ p , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshi@@ ped the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king had set up .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king was astonished , and rose up in ha@@ ste : he spoke and said to his counsel@@ ors , did@@ n '@@ t we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered the king , True , O king .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace : he spoke and said , Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go , you servants of the Most High God , come forth , and come here . then Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go came forth out of the midst of the fire .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar , while he t@@ asted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king and his lords , his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , might drink from them .
now the wise men , the enchan@@ ters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trem@@ bled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Med@@ es and Per@@ sians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
when he came near to the den to Daniel , he cried with a lam@@ ent@@ able voice ; the king spoke and said to Daniel , Daniel , servant of the living God , is your God , whom you serve continually , able to deliver you from the lions ?
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands minist@@ ered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was sl@@ ain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
there was given him dom@@ inion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dom@@ inion is an everlasting dom@@ inion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal , which was diverse from all of them , exceedingly terrible , whose teeth were of iron , and its nails of brass ; which dev@@ oured , broke in pieces , and stamped the resi@@ due with its feet ;
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be diverse from all the king@@ doms , and shall dev@@ our the whole earth , and shall t@@ read it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
he shall speak words against the Most High , and shall wear out the saints of the Most High ; and he shall think to change the times and the law ; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the cit@@ ad@@ el of Sus@@ a , which is in the province of EL@@ AM ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
the male goat magni@@ fied himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonder@@ fully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
in the first year of his reign I , Daniel , understood by the books the number of the years about which the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , for the accompl@@ ishing of the des@@ ol@@ ations of Jerusalem , even seventy years .
he has confirmed his words , which he spoke against us , and against our judges who judged us , by bringing on us a great evil ; for under the whole sky , such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil has come on us : yet have we not entre@@ ated the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , that we should turn from our ini@@ qu@@ ities , and have discer@@ n@@ ment in your truth .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renow@@ n , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ick@@ edly .
in the third year of Cy@@ rus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel , whose name was called Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and the thing was true , even a great warfare : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Call his name J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ enge the blood of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el on the house of Je@@ hu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
the children of Jud@@ ah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
for their mother has played the pro@@ stitute . she who conceived them has done sham@@ efully ; for she said , ' I will go after my lovers , who give me my bread and my water , my wool and my fla@@ x , my oil and my drink . '
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Ach@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the pro@@ stitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
hear the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you children of Israel ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
let us acknowledge Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . let us press on to know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . as surely as the sun rises , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
when I would heal Israel , then the ini@@ qu@@ ity of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is uncovered , also the w@@ ick@@ edness of Sam@@ aria ; for they commit false@@ hood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of rob@@ bers rav@@ ages outside .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made princes , and I did@@ n '@@ t approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols , that they may be cut off .
the high places also of A@@ ven , the sin of Israel , will be destroyed . the thor@@ n and the th@@ ist@@ le will come up on their al@@ t@@ ars . they will tell the mountains , " C@@ over us ! " and the hills , " Fall on us ! "
sancti@@ fy a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , and cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
gather the people . sancti@@ fy the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bri@@ deg@@ room go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
" be glad then , you children of Z@@ ion , and rejoice in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God ; for he gives you the former rain in just measure , and he causes the rain to come down for you , the former rain and the latter rain , as before .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , who has dealt won@@ dr@@ ously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
it will happen that whoever will call on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be saved ; for in Mount Z@@ ion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said , and among the remn@@ ant , those whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h calls .
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations . they have divided my land ,

they all said to each other , " Come , let us cast lots , that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us . " so they cast lots , and the lot fell on Jon@@ ah .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stor@@ my .

Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God prepared a vine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his discomfort . so Jon@@ ah was exceedingly glad because of the vine .
it happened , when the sun arose , that God prepared a sul@@ try east wind ; and the sun beat on Jon@@ ah 's head , so that he fain@@ ted , and requested for himself that he might die , and said , " It is better for me to die than to live . "

" the hands of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el have laid the foundation of this house . his hands shall also finish it ; and you will know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sent me to you .

Simon Peter said to them , " I 'm going fishing . " they told him , " We are also coming with you . " they immediately went out , and entered into the boat . that night , they caught nothing .
then Peter , turning around , saw a disciple following . this was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved , the one who had also leaned on Jesus ' breast at the sup@@ per and asked , " Lord , who is going to betray You ? "
who also said , " You men of Gal@@ ilee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? this Jesus , who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky . "
when they had come in , they went up into the upper room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ om@@ ew , Matthew , James the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus , Simon the Zeal@@ ot , and Jud@@ as the son of James .
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and spoke out to them , " You men of Ju@@ dea , and all you who dwell at Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and listen to my words .
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
Peter said to them , " Rep@@ ent , and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
a certain man who was lame from his mother 's womb was being carried , whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Be@@ auti@@ ful , to ask gifts for the ne@@ edy of those who entered into the temple .
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the ne@@ edy at the Be@@ auti@@ ful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at what had happened to him .
for Moses indeed said to the fathers , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
be it known to you all , and to all the people of Israel , that in the name of Jesus Christ of Naz@@ areth , whom you cruci@@ fied , whom God raised from the dead , in him does this man stand here before you whole .
" for truly , in this city against your holy servant , Jesus , whom you ano@@ inted , both Her@@ od and Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate , with the Genti@@ les and the people of Israel , were gathered together
after this man , Jud@@ as of Gal@@ ilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some people after him . he also perished , and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
he gave him the covenant of circum@@ cision . so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circum@@ c@@ ised him the eighth day . Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob became the father of the twelve patri@@ archs .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' S@@ irs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
I have surely seen the afflic@@ tion of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their gro@@ aning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
" this Moses , whom they refused , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ' -@@ -@@ God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
but God turned , and gave them up to serve the army of the sky , as it is written in the book of the prophets , ' Did you offer to me sl@@ ain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
'@@ heaven is my throne , and the earth a foot@@ stool for my feet . what kind of house will you build me ? ' says the Lord ; ' or what is the place of my rest ?
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up stead@@ fast@@ ly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
he arose and went ; and behold , there was a man of Ethiopia , a e@@ un@@ uch of great authority under C@@ and@@ ace , queen of the Ethiop@@ ians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jerusalem to worship .
now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named An@@ ani@@ as . the Lord said to him in a vision , " An@@ ani@@ as ! " he said , " Be@@ hold , it 's me , Lord . "
the Lord said to him , " A@@ rise , and go to the street which is called Str@@ ai@@ ght , and inqu@@ ire in the house of Jud@@ ah for one named Saul , a man of Tar@@ sus . for behold , he is praying ,
An@@ ani@@ as departed , and entered into the house . laying his hands on him , he said , " Brother Saul , the Lord , who appeared to you on the road by which you came , has sent me , that you may receive your sight , and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
but Bar@@ nab@@ as took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus .
he , fast@@ ening his eyes on him , and being frightened , said , " What is it , Lord ? " he said to him , " Your prayers and your gifts to the ne@@ edy have gone up for a memorial before God .
" I was in the city of J@@ op@@ pa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision : a certain container descending , like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners . it came as far as me .
and behold , an angel of the Lord stood by him , and a light shone in the cell . he struck Peter on the side , and woke him up , saying , " Stand up quickly ! " his chains fell off from his hands .
the angel said to him , " Get dressed and put on your sand@@ als . " he did so . he said to him , " P@@ ut on your cloak , and follow me . "
but he , bec@@ k@@ oning to them with his hand to be silent , declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . he said , " Tell these things to James , and to the brothers . " then he departed , and went to another place .
when Her@@ od had sought for him , and did@@ n '@@ t find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Ju@@ dea to Caes@@ area , and stayed there .
after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of ex@@ hor@@ tation for the people , speak . "
when he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king , to whom he also testified , ' I have found David the son of Jes@@ se , a man after my heart , who will do all my will . '
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Ly@@ ca@@ onia , " The gods have come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men ! "
when there had been much discussion , Peter rose up and said to them , " Brothers , you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News , and believe .
'@@ After these things I will return . I will again build the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David , which has fallen . I will again build its ruins . I will set it up ,
they wrote these things by their hand : " the apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Genti@@ les in Anti@@ o@@ ch , Syria , and C@@ il@@ icia : greetings .
a certain woman named Ly@@ dia , a seller of purple , of the city of T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , one who worshi@@ ped God , heard us ; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul .
she was doing this for many days . but Paul , becoming greatly anno@@ yed , turned and said to the spirit , " I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! " it came out that very hour .
but when Paul was about to open his mouth , G@@ alli@@ o said to the Jews , " If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime , you Jews , it would be reasonable that I should bear with you ;
Paul , having stayed after this many more days , took his leave of the brothers , and s@@ ailed from there for Syria , together with P@@ ris@@ c@@ illa and Aqu@@ ila . he sha@@ ved his head in Cen@@ ch@@ re@@ ae , for he had a vo@@ w .
he said to them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " they said to him , " No , we haven '@@ t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . "
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Ac@@ ha@@ ia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
for Paul had determined to sail past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was ha@@ st@@ ening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentec@@ ost .
but these things don '@@ t count ; nor do I hold my life dear to myself , so that I may finish my race with joy , and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God .
take heed , therefore , to yourselves , and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you over@@ se@@ ers , to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood .
in all things I gave you an example , that so lab@@ oring you ought to help the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he himself said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . ' "
but concerning the Genti@@ les who believe , we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing , except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols , from blood , from strang@@ led things , and from sexual im@@ morality . "
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " rid the earth of this fellow , for he is@@ n '@@ t fit to live ! "
but on the next day , desi@@ ring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews , he freed him from the bonds , and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together , and brought Paul down and set him before them .
but when Paul perceived that the one part were Sad@@ duc@@ ees and the other Pharis@@ ees , he cried out in the council , " Men and brothers , I am a Pharis@@ ee , a son of Pharis@@ ees . concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged ! "
a great clam@@ or arose , and some of the scri@@ bes of the Pharis@@ ees part stood up , and cont@@ ended , saying , " We find no evil in this man . but if a spirit or angel has spoken to him , let 's not fight against God ! "
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the bar@@ racks .
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
therefore don '@@ t yield to them , for more than forty men lie in wait for him , who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him . now they are ready , looking for the promise from you . "
but this I confess to you , that after the Way , which they call a sect , so I serve the God of our fathers , believing all things which are according to the law , and which are written in the prophets ;
as he reasoned about righteousness , self @@@ -@@ @ control , and the judgment to come , Felix was terrified , and answered , " Go your way for this time , and when it is convenient for me , I will sum@@ mon you . "
but F@@ est@@ us , desi@@ ring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persec@@ uting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the go@@ ads . '
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
to open their eyes , that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive rem@@ is@@ sion of sins and an inheritance among those who are sancti@@ fied by faith in me . '
how the Christ must suffer , and how , by the resurrection of the dead , he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Genti@@ les . "
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " S@@ irs , you should have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and have gotten this injury and loss .
when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
he is the father of circum@@ cision to those who not only are of the circum@@ cision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in un@@ circum@@ cision .
but the free gift is@@ n '@@ t like the t@@ resp@@ ass . for if by the t@@ resp@@ ass of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God , and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound to the many .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? may it never be ! however , I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have known sin , except through the law . for I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have known cov@@ eting , unless the law had said , " You shall not co@@ vet . "
did then that which is good become death to me ? may it never be ! but sin , that it might be shown to be sin , by working death to me through that which is good ; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful .
for what the law cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don '@@ t know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes interc@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which can '@@ t be uttered .
for the Scripture says to Phar@@ aoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
Don '@@ t seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " Ven@@ ge@@ ance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
for it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . every tongue will confess to God . ' "
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a hel@@ per of many , and of my own self .
to the assembly of God which is at Cor@@ inth ; those who are sancti@@ fied in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both theirs and ours :
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perf@@ ected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . but let each man be careful how he builds on it .
now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and A@@ pol@@ los for your s@@ akes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be pu@@ ffed up against one another .
or don '@@ t you know that the un@@ righteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Don '@@ t be deceived . neither the sexually immoral , nor id@@ ol@@ aters , nor adul@@ ter@@ ers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosex@@ uals ,
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sancti@@ fied . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
" foods for the belly , and the belly for foods , " but God will bring to nothing both it and them . but the body is not for sexual im@@ morality , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
Don '@@ t deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan do@@ es@@ n '@@ t temp@@ t you because of your lack of self @@@ -@@ @ control .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to wh@@ om@@ ever she desires , only in the Lord .
yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we live through him .
if others par@@ take of this right over you , don '@@ t we yet more ? nevertheless we did not use this right , but we bear all things , that we may cause no hind@@ r@@ ance to the Good News of Christ .
for if I preach the Good News , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but w@@ oe is to me , if I don '@@ t preach the Good News .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
but if one of those who don '@@ t believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
for , " He put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . " but when he says , " All things are put in subj@@ ection , " it is evident that he is excep@@ ted who subjected all things to him .
now I beg you , brothers ( you know the house of Step@@ han@@ as , that it is the first fruits of Ac@@ ha@@ ia , and that they have set themselves to serve the saints ) ,
when I therefore was thus determined , did I show fic@@ kl@@ eness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be the " Yes , yes " and the " No , no ? "
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " A@@ men , " to the glory of God through us .
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
but if the service of death , written engra@@ ved on stones , came with glory , so that the children of Israel could not look stead@@ fast@@ ly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face ; which was passing away :
but we have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craft@@ iness , nor handling the word of God dece@@ it@@ fully ; but by the manifestation of the truth comm@@ ending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world has blin@@ ded the minds of the un@@ believing , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
for we are not comm@@ ending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of bo@@ asting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
what agreement has a temple of God with idols ? for you are a temple of the living God . even as God said , " I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people . "
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glori@@ fy God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liber@@ ality of your contribution to them and to all ;
I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I don '@@ t know , or whether out of the body , I don '@@ t know ; God knows ) , such a one caught up into the third heaven .
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
and when they perceived the grace that was given to me , James and C@@ ep@@ has and John , they who were re@@ puted to be pillars , gave to me and Bar@@ nab@@ as the right hand of fellowship , that we should go to the Genti@@ les , and they to the circum@@ cision .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
but now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable el@@ emental principles , to which you desire to be in bond@@ age all over again ?
for it is written , " Re@@ jo@@ ice , you bar@@ ren who don '@@ t bear . break forth and shout , you that don '@@ t trav@@ ail . for more are the children of the des@@ ol@@ ate than of her who has a husband . "
en@@ vy@@ ings , murders , drun@@ ken@@ ness , or@@ gies , and things like these ; of which I fore@@ warn you , even as I also fore@@ warned you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
it is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you , because I have you in my heart , because , both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News , you all are part@@ akers with me of grace .
only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ , that , whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your state , that you stand firm in one spirit , with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News ;
yes , I beg you also , true yo@@ ke@@ fellow , help these women , for they lab@@ ored with me in the Good News , with Cl@@ ement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
I know how to be hum@@ bled , and I know also how to abound . in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in need .
let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and wor@@ shipping of the angels , dwelling in the things which he has not seen , v@@ ain@@ ly pu@@ ffed up by his fl@@ esh@@ ly mind ,
even so , aff@@ ection@@ ately longing for you , we were well pleased to im@@ part to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord forever .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another ab@@ ounds ;
as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous man , but for the law@@ less and in@@ subordinate , for the un@@ go@@ dly and sinners , for the un@@ holy and prof@@ ane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for man@@ s@@ layers ,
but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God 's house , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
but if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show pi@@ ety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
for this cause I also suffer these things . yet I am not ashamed , for I know him whom I have believed , and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day .
from now on , there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give to me on that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing .
no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much rather to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
you have put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don '@@ t see all things subjected to him , yet .
for God is not un@@ righteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t need , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices daily , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . for he did this once for all , when he offered up himself .
for finding fault with them , he said , " Be@@ hold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Jud@@ ah ;
for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , since a death has occurred for the redemption of the trans@@ gres@@ sions that were under the first covenant , that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the cal@@ ves and the goats , with water and scar@@ let wool and h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and sprink@@ led both the book itself and all the people ,
by faith , A@@ bel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than C@@ ain , through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous , God testi@@ fying with respect to his gifts ; and through it he , being dead , still speaks .
by faith , E@@ no@@ ch was taken away , so that he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with go@@ dly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fa@@ ther@@ ed by one man , and him as good as dead .
they were st@@ oned . they were s@@ awn apart . they were tempted . they were sl@@ ain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being des@@ tit@@ ute , afflicted , ill @@@ -@@ @ treated
listen , my beloved brothers . did@@ n '@@ t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
Don '@@ t speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
behold , we call them blessed who endured . you have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the Lord in the outcome , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he predicted the sufferings of Christ , and the gl@@ ories that would follow them .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
you husbands , in the same way , live with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor to the woman , as to the weaker vessel , as being also joint heirs of the grace of life ; that your prayers may not be hindered .
if you are insul@@ ted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed , but on your part he is glori@@ fied .
Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that per@@ tain to life and god@@ liness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of de@@ fil@@ ement , and desp@@ ise authority . daring , self @@@ -@@ @ w@@ illed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dig@@ nit@@ aries ;
for if , after they have escaped the de@@ fil@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again ent@@ angled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is@@ n '@@ t the Father 's , but is the world 's .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know us , because it did@@ n '@@ t know him .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe God has made him a li@@ ar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
having many things to write to you , I don '@@ t want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
for there are certain men who cre@@ pt in secretly , even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation : un@@ go@@ dly men , turning the grace of our God into in@@ dec@@ ency , and denying our only Master , God , and Lord , Jesus Christ .
and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the fir@@ st@@ born of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . to him who loves us , and washed us from our sins by his blood ;
he who over@@ comes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also over@@ came , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
one of the elders said to me , " Don '@@ t we@@ ep . behold , the Lion who is of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , the Root of David , has overcome ; he who opens the book and its seven seals . "
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lam@@ b standing , as though it had been sl@@ ain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven Spir@@ its of God , sent out into all the earth .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders fell down before the Lam@@ b , each one having a har@@ p , and golden bow@@ ls full of inc@@ ense , which are the prayers of the saints .
another came forth , a red horse . to him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another . there was given to him a great sword .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A cho@@ en@@ ix of wheat for a den@@ arius , and three cho@@ en@@ ix of barley for a den@@ arius ! Don '@@ t damage the oil and the wine ! "
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the fourth angel sounded , and one third of the sun was struck , and one third of the moon , and one third of the stars ; so that one third of them would be dark@@ ened , and the day w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t shine for one third of it , and the night in the same way .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were dark@@ ened because of the smoke from the pit .
and s@@ wore by him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , that there will no longer be delay ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
these have the power to shut up the sky , that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy . they have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might dev@@ our her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t worship the image of the beast to be killed .
I saw , and behold , the Lam@@ b standing on Mount Z@@ ion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their fore@@ heads .
they sing a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , those who had been re@@ deemed out of the earth .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sick@@ le , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
they sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lam@@ b , saying , " Great and marvelous are your works , Lord God , the Almighty ! righteous and true are your ways , you King of the nations .
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
I saw the woman drun@@ ken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the marty@@ rs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amaz@@ ement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her des@@ ol@@ ate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
however much she glori@@ fied herself , and grew w@@ ant@@ on , so much give her of tor@@ ment and mourning . for she says in her heart , ' I sit a queen , and am no widow , and will in no way see mourning . '
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual im@@ morality and lived w@@ ant@@ only with her , will we@@ ep and w@@ ail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Th@@ us with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bri@@ deg@@ room and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sor@@ cery all the nations were deceived .
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Gi@@ ve praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty th@@ un@@ ders , saying , " H@@ all@@ elu@@ jah ! for the Lord our God , the Almighty , re@@ igns !
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
but for the cow@@ ardly , un@@ believing , sinners , ab@@ om@@ in@@ able , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcer@@ ers , id@@ ol@@ aters , and all li@@ ars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
one of the seven angels who had the seven bow@@ ls , who were loaded with the seven last pl@@ agues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the Lam@@ b 's bride . "
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the B@@ right and Morning Star . "
and God said , Let there be lights in the firm@@ ament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have dom@@ inion over the fish of the sea , and over the f@@ owl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every f@@ owl of the air , and to every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth , where@@ in there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for meat : and it was so .
now the ser@@ pent was more sub@@ til than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . and he said unto the woman , Y@@ ea , hath God said , Y@@ e shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Y@@ e shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it w@@ ast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
and the LORD said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the cre@@ eping thing , and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air ; for it repent@@ eth me that I have made them .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , where@@ in is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of f@@ owl , and of cattle , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth ; that they may breed ab@@ und@@ antly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and the LORD sm@@ elled a sweet sav@@ our ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again sm@@ ite any more every thing living , as I have done .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sar@@ ai his wife , Be@@ hold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
and L@@ ot lifted up his eyes , and be@@ held all the plain of Jordan , that it was well wat@@ ered every where , before the LORD destroyed So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou com@@ est unto Zo@@ ar .
and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Ab@@ ram the Hebrew ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the plain of Mam@@ re the A@@ mor@@ ite , brother of E@@ sch@@ ol , and brother of An@@ er : and these were con@@ feder@@ ate with Ab@@ ram .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
and he said unto Ab@@ ram , Know of a su@@ rety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall aff@@ l@@ ict them four hundred years ;
and when Ab@@ ram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Ab@@ ram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land where@@ in thou art a stranger , all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circum@@ c@@ ised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
and I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : ye@@ a , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Sh@@ all a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and I will fetch a mor@@ sel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .
and he said unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Per@@ adventure there shall thirty be found there . and he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Per@@ adventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and while he ling@@ ered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the LORD being mer@@ ciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
and he looked toward So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , and toward all the land of the plain , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent L@@ ot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which L@@ ot d@@ wel@@ t .
but God came to Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h in a dream by night , and said to him , Be@@ hold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are th@@ ine .
and unto Sarah he said , Be@@ hold , I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes , unto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus she was re@@ proved .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave it unto Hag@@ ar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wan@@ dered in the wilderness of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bow@@ shot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and we@@ pt .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and sadd@@ led his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and cl@@ ave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a th@@ icket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
that he may give me the cave of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place amongst you .
and E@@ ph@@ ron d@@ wel@@ t among the children of H@@ eth : and E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
and Abraham hear@@ k@@ ened unto E@@ ph@@ ron ; and Abraham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of H@@ eth , four hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , which was in Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which was before Mam@@ re , the field , and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah came out , who was born to Beth@@ u@@ el , son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Abraham 's brother , with her p@@ itch@@ er upon her shoulder .
and it came to pass , as the cam@@ els had done drinking , that the man took a golden ear@@ ring of half a she@@ kel weight , and two brac@@ elets for her hands of ten she@@ k@@ els weight of gold ;
and the man came into the house : and he un@@ gir@@ ded his cam@@ els , and gave straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for the cam@@ els , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him f@@ locks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and men@@ servants , and mai@@ d@@ servants , and cam@@ els , and asses .
and he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kind@@ red , and of my father 's house :
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah came forth with her p@@ itch@@ er on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
and she made ha@@ ste , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er from her shoulder , and said , Dr@@ ink , and I will give thy cam@@ els drink also : so I drank , and she made the cam@@ els drink also .
and I asked her , and said , Wh@@ ose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Beth@@ u@@ el , N@@ ah@@ or 's son , whom Mil@@ ca@@ h bare unto him : and I put the ear@@ ring upon her face , and the brac@@ elets upon her hands .
and the servant brought forth jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and ra@@ iment , and gave them to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they blessed Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , and said unto her , Th@@ ou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that wal@@ ket@@ h in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a V@@ ail , and covered herself .
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ne@@ ba@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ edar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ s@@ am ,
so@@ jour@@ n in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sw@@ are unto Abraham thy father ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah his wife .
and they said , We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee : and we said , Let there be now an oath bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t us , even bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wil@@ t do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and he came near , and kis@@ sed him : and he sm@@ elled the smell of his ra@@ iment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed :
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Es@@ au his brother came in from his hunting .
and when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , B@@ less me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac answered and said unto Es@@ au , Be@@ hold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dom@@ inion , that thou shalt break his y@@ oke from off thy neck .
and these words of Es@@ au her elder son were told to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , Be@@ hold , thy brother Es@@ au , as touching thee , do@@ th comfort himself , pur@@ posing to kill thee .
and Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of H@@ eth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of H@@ eth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
and he lighted upon a certain place , and tar@@ ried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pil@@ lows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and , behold , the LORD stood above it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land where@@ on thou li@@ est , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ;
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three f@@ locks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ locks : and a great stone was upon the well 's mouth .
and thi@@ ther were all the f@@ locks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Lab@@ an heard the ti@@ dings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kis@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Lab@@ an all these things .
and it came to pass , that in the morning , behold , it was Le@@ ah : and he said to Lab@@ an , What is this thou hast done unto me ? did not I serve with thee for Rach@@ el ? W@@ herefore then hast thou be@@ gu@@ iled me ?
and Re@@ ub@@ en went in the days of wheat harvest , and found man@@ dr@@ akes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Le@@ ah . then Rach@@ el said to Le@@ ah , Gi@@ ve me , I pray thee , of thy son 's man@@ dr@@ akes .
and Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Le@@ ah went out to meet him , and said , Th@@ ou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . and he lay with her that night .
and Lab@@ an said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in th@@ ine eyes , tar@@ ry : for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ring@@ str@@ aked and spotted , and all the she goats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Es@@ au : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t drove and drove .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thi@@ gh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thi@@ gh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
and Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . and he said , W@@ herefore is it that thou d@@ ost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and Jacob said , N@@ ay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou w@@ ast pleased with me .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that go@@ eth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Se@@ ir .
and the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were griev@@ ed , and they were very w@@ ro@@ th , because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
these men are peace@@ able with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
and it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Sim@@ eon and Lev@@ i , Din@@ ah 's brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and sle@@ w all the males .
and these are the sons of Re@@ u@@ el Es@@ au 's son ; du@@ ke N@@ ah@@ ath , du@@ ke Zer@@ ah , du@@ ke Sham@@ ma@@ h , du@@ ke M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the du@@ kes that came of Re@@ u@@ el in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bash@@ em@@ ath Es@@ au 's wife .
and these are the sons of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah Es@@ au 's wife ; du@@ ke Je@@ ush , du@@ ke Ja@@ al@@ am , du@@ ke Kor@@ ah : these were the du@@ kes that came of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife .
and Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Han@@ an the son of Ach@@ b@@ or died , and Had@@ ar re@@ igned in his stead : and the name of his city was P@@ au ; and his wife 's name was Me@@ het@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Me@@ z@@ a@@ hab .
for , behold , we were binding she@@ aves in the field , and , lo , my she@@ af arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your she@@ aves stood round about , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to my she@@ af .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Be@@ hold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obe@@ is@@ ance to me .
and he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the f@@ locks ; and bring me word again . so he sent him out of the val@@ e of He@@ br@@ on , and he came to Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites merchan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ elites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and On@@ an knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and it came to pass , when she tr@@ avail@@ ed , that the one put out his hand : and the mid@@ wife took and bound upon his hand a scar@@ let thread , saying , This came out first ,
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him over@@ se@@ er in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
and it came to pass , as she sp@@ ake to Joseph day by day , that he hear@@ k@@ ened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
that she called unto the men of her house , and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mo@@ ck us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kind@@ led .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and sh@@ ew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Phar@@ aoh , and bring me out of this house :
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the mag@@ icians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Phar@@ aoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Phar@@ aoh .
and he said unto his brethren , My money is restored ; and , lo , it is even in my sack : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to another , What is this that God hath done unto us ?
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ dles of money , they were afraid .
and it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our s@@ acks , and , behold , every man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the He@@ bre@@ ws ; for that is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the Egyptians .
and when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his ste@@ ward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou d@@ ost over@@ take them , say unto them , W@@ herefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
behold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
and Jud@@ ah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord 's servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Jud@@ ah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not th@@ ine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as Phar@@ aoh .
and we said unto my lord , We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father lov@@ eth him .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hath made me a father to Phar@@ aoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were thre@@ es@@ core and ten .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and sh@@ ew Phar@@ aoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , are come unto me ;
that ye shall say , Th@@ y servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen ; for every shepherd is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the Egyptians .
they said moreover unto Phar@@ aoh , For to so@@ jour@@ n in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no past@@ ure for their f@@ locks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Can@@ a@@ an : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fain@@ ted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Phar@@ aoh 's house .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and as for me , when I came from Pad@@ an , Rach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto E@@ phr@@ ath : and I buried her there in the way of E@@ phr@@ ath ; the same is Bethlehem .
the Angel which re@@ deemed me from all evil , bless the lad@@ s ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that li@@ eth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Phar@@ aoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and when the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , saw the mourning in the floor of At@@ ad , they said , This is a griev@@ ous mourning to the Egyptians : W@@ herefore the name of it was called A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ m@@ iz@@ ra@@ im , which is beyond Jordan .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bond@@ age , in mor@@ ter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , where@@ in they made them serve , was with ri@@ g@@ our .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bul@@ r@@ ushes , and da@@ ub@@ ed it with sli@@ me and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's brink .
now when Phar@@ aoh heard this thing , he sought to sl@@ ay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Phar@@ aoh , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and he said , Cer@@ tain@@ ly I will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain .
and God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Th@@ us shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that so@@ jour@@ neth in her house , jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and ra@@ iment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who mak@@ eth the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ?
and the tale of the bricks , which they did make her@@ et@@ o@@ fore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in th@@ ine own people .
and they said unto them , The LORD look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our sav@@ our to be ab@@ hor@@ red in the eyes of Phar@@ aoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to sl@@ ay us .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and thou shalt say unto him , The LORD God of the He@@ bre@@ ws hath sent me unto thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou w@@ oul@@ dest not hear .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stan@@ k , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , S@@ ay unto Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
then Phar@@ aoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , In@@ treat the LORD , that he may take away the fro@@ gs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smo@@ te the dust of the earth , and it became l@@ ice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and I will s@@ ever in that day the land of Gos@@ hen , in which my people dwell , that no s@@ war@@ ms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou may@@ est know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth .
and Phar@@ aoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : int@@ re@@ at for me .
and Moses said , Be@@ hold , I go out from thee , and I will int@@ re@@ at the LORD that the s@@ war@@ ms of flies may depart from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people , to mor@@ row : but let not Phar@@ aoh deal dece@@ it@@ fully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD .
behold , the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the cam@@ els , upon the ox@@ en , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very griev@@ ous mur@@ rain .
and Phar@@ aoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israel@@ ites dead . and the heart of Phar@@ aoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with bl@@ ains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the LORD said unto Moses , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and the LORD said unto Moses , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand over the land of Egypt for the lo@@ cu@@ sts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and the lo@@ cu@@ sts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very griev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such lo@@ cu@@ sts as they , neither after them shall be such .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh that sit@@ t@@ eth upon his throne , even unto the fir@@ st@@ born of the mai@@ d@@ servant that is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of beasts .
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Phar@@ aoh in a great anger .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will sm@@ ite all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the LORD .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I sm@@ ite the land of Egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
seven days shall there be no leav@@ en found in your houses : for wh@@ oso@@ ever e@@ at@@ eth that which is leav@@ ened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
and ye shall take a bunch of h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ on , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ on ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
and Moses said unto the people , Rem@@ ember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age ; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place : there shall no leav@@ ened bread be eaten .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon th@@ ine hand , and for a memorial between th@@ ine eyes , that the LORD 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt .
and the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
and they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? W@@ herefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fe@@ ar ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the LORD , which he will sh@@ ew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD over@@ threw the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an hab@@ itation ; my father 's God , and I will ex@@ alt him .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of th@@ ine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanc@@ tuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
and he cried unto the LORD ; and the LORD sh@@ ew@@ ed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordin@@ ance , and there he proved them ,
and they took their journey from Eli@@ m , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of S@@ in , which is between Eli@@ m and Sinai , on the fif@@ teenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he he@@ areth your mur@@ mur@@ ings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye mur@@ mur against us ?
and when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is man@@ na : for they w@@ ist not what it was . and Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat .
this is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , G@@ ather of it every man according to his eating , an O@@ mer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
see , for that the LORD hath given you the sab@@ bath , therefore he gi@@ v@@ eth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and Moses said , This is the thing which the LORD comman@@ det@@ h , F@@ ill an O@@ mer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread where@@ with I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
W@@ herefore the people did chi@@ de with Moses , and said , Gi@@ ve us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chi@@ de ye with me ? W@@ herefore do ye temp@@ t the LORD ?
and the people thir@@ sted there for water ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses , and said , W@@ herefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in H@@ ore@@ b ; and thou shalt sm@@ ite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and Je@@ thr@@ o said , Bless@@ ed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Phar@@ aoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thy@@ self , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
and Moses went up unto God , and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Th@@ us shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were th@@ un@@ ders and light@@ nings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trum@@ pet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trem@@ bled .
and the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul ; and he shall serve him for ever .
if she please not her master , who hath bet@@ ro@@ thed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt dece@@ it@@ fully with her .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circum@@ spect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nad@@ ab , and A@@ bi@@ hu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye af@@ ar off .
and Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the LORD hath said will we do .
and Moses wrote all the words of the LORD , and rose up early in the morning , and buil@@ ded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the LORD hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Come up to me into the mount , and be there : and I will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments which I have written ; that thou may@@ est teach them .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt make a cand@@ les@@ tick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the cand@@ les@@ tick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bow@@ ls , his kno@@ ps , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the cand@@ les@@ tick out of the one side , and three branches of the cand@@ les@@ tick out of the other side :
and there shall be a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the cand@@ les@@ tick .
and a cub@@ it on the one side , and a cub@@ it on the other side of that which remain@@ eth in the length of the curtains of the tent , it shall hang over the sides of the tab@@ ern@@ acle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
and thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and over@@ lay them with gold , and their hoo@@ ks shall be of gold : and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them .
and for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cub@@ its , of blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen , wrought with need@@ le@@ work : and their pillars shall be four , and their sockets four .
in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation without the V@@ ail , which is before the testimony , Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD : it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel .
and the curious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen .
and thou shalt make the breast@@ plate of judgment with cunning work ; after the work of the ep@@ ho@@ d thou shalt make it ; of gold , of blue , and of purple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine tw@@ ined linen , shalt thou make it .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breast@@ plate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d inward .
and Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breast@@ plate of judgment upon his heart , when he go@@ eth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the LORD continually .
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates of blue , and of purple , and of scar@@ let , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
and thou shalt offer every day a bul@@ lock for a sin offering for at@@ onement : and thou shalt clean@@ se the altar , when thou hast made an at@@ onement for it , and thou shalt ano@@ int it , to sancti@@ fy it .
and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour ming@@ led with the fourth part of an H@@ in of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an H@@ in of wine for a drink offering .
this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before the LORD : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
and two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it , by the two corners thereof , upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it ; and they shall be for places for the st@@ aves to bear it with@@ al .
and Aaron shall make an at@@ onement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of at@@ on@@ ements : once in the year shall he make at@@ onement upon it throughout your generations : it is most holy unto the LORD .
when thou tak@@ est the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ran@@ som for his soul unto the LORD , when thou num@@ ber@@ est them ; that there be no plague among them , when thou num@@ ber@@ est them .
when they go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , they shall wash with water , that they die not ; or when they come near to the altar to minister , to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD :
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and I , behold , I have given with him A@@ hol@@ i@@ ab , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , Ver@@ ily my sab@@ baths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the LORD that do@@ th sancti@@ fy you .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a gra@@ ving tool , after he had made it a mol@@ ten cal@@ f : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a mol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shipped it , and have sacrificed there@@ unto , and said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
for Moses had said , consec@@ rate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may best@@ ow upon you a blessing this day .
and the LORD said unto Moses , De@@ part , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sw@@ are unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , Un@@ to thy seed will I give it :
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the LORD talked with Moses .
and he he@@ wed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the LORD had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
keeping mercy for thousands , for@@ giving ini@@ qu@@ ity and trans@@ g@@ ression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and he said , If now I have found grace in thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee , go among us ; for it is a sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked people ; and pardon our ini@@ qu@@ ity and our sin , and take us for th@@ ine inheritance .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Hit@@ tite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread shalt thou keep . seven days thou shalt eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month A@@ bi@@ b : for in the month A@@ bi@@ b thou cam@@ est out from Egypt .
but the fir@@ st@@ ling of an ass thou shalt re@@ deem with a lamb : and if thou re@@ deem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . all the fir@@ st@@ born of thy sons thou shalt re@@ deem . and none shall appear before me empty .
but when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him , he took the V@@ ail off , until he came out . and he came out , and sp@@ ake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the LORD 's offering to the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
and they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted , and brought brac@@ elets , and ear@@ rings , and rings , and tablets , all jew@@ els of gold : and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD .
then wrought B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el and A@@ hol@@ i@@ ab , and every wise hearted man , in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that the LORD had commanded .
and Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . so the people were restrained from bringing .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , to be set by the four corners of it ; even two rings upon the one side of it , and two rings upon the other side of it .
and the cher@@ ub@@ ims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy se@@ at@@ ward were the faces of the cher@@ ub@@ ims .
and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the st@@ aves to bear it with@@ al .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was need@@ le@@ work , of blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen : and twenty cub@@ its was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cub@@ its , answ@@ er@@ able to the hang@@ ings of the court .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the V@@ ail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and of the blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , they made clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and the curious gir@@ dle of his ep@@ ho@@ d , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and they did bind the breast@@ plate by his rings unto the rings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the breast@@ plate might not be loos@@ ed from the ep@@ ho@@ d ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD , ye shall bring your offering of the cattle , even of the herd , and of the flock .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the LORD , shall be made with leav@@ en : for ye shall burn no leav@@ en , nor any honey , in any offering of the LORD made by fire .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
even the whole bul@@ lock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
and if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
and he shall do with the bul@@ lock as he did with the bul@@ lock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
or if his sin , which he hath sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without bl@@ emish , for his sin which he hath sin@@ ned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of sw@@ earing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
or if a soul touch any un@@ clean thing , whether it be a car@@ case of an un@@ clean beast , or a car@@ case of un@@ clean cattle , or the car@@ case of un@@ clean cre@@ eping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be un@@ clean , and guilty .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his t@@ resp@@ ass , which he hath committed , two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , unto the LORD ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he w@@ ist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
if a soul sin , and commit a t@@ resp@@ ass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
then it shall be , because he hath sin@@ ned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath dece@@ it@@ fully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
or all that about which he hath sworn fal@@ sely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more there@@ to , and give it unto him to whom it ap@@ per@@ tain@@ eth , in the day of his t@@ resp@@ ass offering .
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen bre@@ ech@@ es shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is b@@ aken , thou shalt bring it in : and the b@@ aken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprink@@ led of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that where@@ on it was sprink@@ led in the holy place .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole ob@@ lation for an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD , and it shall be the priest 's that sprink@@ let@@ h the blood of the peace offerings .
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their ob@@ l@@ ations unto the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar , and sancti@@ fied it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thum@@ bs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and Moses sprink@@ led the blood upon the altar round about .
and he took the fat , and the r@@ ump , and all the fat that was upon the in@@ wards , and the c@@ aul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
and Moses took the breast , and wav@@ ed it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consec@@ ration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , B@@ oil the flesh at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consec@@ r@@ ations , as I commanded , saying , Aaron and his sons shall eat it .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Go unto the altar , and offer thy sin offering , and thy burnt offering , and make an at@@ onement for thy@@ self , and for the people : and offer the offering of the people , and make an at@@ onement for them ; as the LORD commanded .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and Moses sp@@ ake unto Aaron , and unto Ele@@ az@@ ar and unto I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remain@@ eth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and eat it without leav@@ en beside the altar : for it is most holy :
and Moses dilig@@ ently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Ele@@ az@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying ,
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the ho@@ of : as the cam@@ el , because he chew@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ det@@ h not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean unto you .
and all that have not fin@@ s and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ om@@ ination unto you :
even these of them ye may eat ; the loc@@ ust after his kind , and the bal@@ d loc@@ ust after his kind , and the beet@@ le after his kind , and the gras@@ shop@@ per after his kind .
and every thing where@@ upon any part of their car@@ case fall@@ eth shall be un@@ clean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are un@@ clean , and shall be un@@ clean unto you .
for I am the LORD your God : ye shall therefore sancti@@ fy yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye def@@ ile yourselves with any manner of cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be un@@ clean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her in@@ firm@@ ity shall she be un@@ clean .
who shall offer it before the LORD , and make an at@@ onement for her ; and she shall be cleans@@ ed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
and if she be not able to bring a lamb , then she shall bring two tur@@ tles , or two young pig@@ eons ; the one for the burnt offering , and the other for a sin offering : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for her , and she shall be clean .
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the le@@ pro@@ sy have covered all his flesh , he shall pron@@ ounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and if , when the priest se@@ eth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean : it is a plague of le@@ pro@@ sy broken out of the boil .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white ha@@ irs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean : it is the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy .
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the sc@@ all : and , behold , if the sc@@ all be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the sc@@ all be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the sc@@ all is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean .
and if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall ren@@ d it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the war@@ p , or out of the wo@@ of :
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall s@@ have all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall s@@ have off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and he shall sl@@ ay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the t@@ resp@@ ass offering : it is most holy :
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the t@@ resp@@ ass offering :
when ye be come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he shall take the c@@ edar wood , and the h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and the scar@@ let , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the sl@@ ain bird , and in the running water , and sprink@@ le the house seven times :
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him before the LORD for his issue .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for her before the LORD for the issue of her un@@ clean@@ ness .
and he shall put the inc@@ ense upon the fire before the LORD , that the cloud of the inc@@ ense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the V@@ ail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bul@@ lock , and sprink@@ le it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat :
and there shall be no man in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation when he go@@ eth in to make an at@@ onement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an at@@ onement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .
after the do@@ ings of the land of Egypt , where@@ in ye d@@ wel@@ t , shall ye not do : and after the do@@ ings of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , whi@@ ther I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordin@@ ances .
thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; for they are her near kin@@ s@@ women : it is w@@ ick@@ edness .
it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the mor@@ row : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
and the soul that tur@@ neth after such as have familiar spirits , and after w@@ izards , to go a wh@@ oring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
and thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of thy mother 's sister , nor of thy father 's sister : for he un@@ cover@@ eth his near kin : they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
but I have said unto you , Y@@ e shall inherit their land , and I will give it unto you to possess it , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey : I am the LORD your God , which have separated you from other people .
a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
they shall be holy unto their God , and not prof@@ ane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor prof@@ ane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the LORD .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they prof@@ ane not my holy name in those things which they hal@@ low unto me : I am the LORD .
what man soever of the seed of Aaron is a le@@ per , or hath a running issue ; he shall not eat of the holy things , until he be clean . and wh@@ os@@ o touch@@ eth any thing that is un@@ clean by the dead , or a man whose seed go@@ eth from him ;
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwit@@ tingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
blind , or broken , or ma@@ im@@ ed , or having a w@@ en , or s@@ cur@@ vy , or sc@@ ab@@ bed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
when a bul@@ lock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and th@@ ence@@ forth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a she@@ af of the fir@@ st@@ fruits of your harvest unto the priest :
and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour ming@@ led with oil , an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet sav@@ our : and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine , the fourth part of an H@@ in .
and ye shall proclaim on the self@@ same day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwell@@ ings throughout your generations .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean rid@@ dance of the corners of thy field when thou re@@ apest , neither shalt thou gather any g@@ leaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the LORD your God .
without the V@@ ail of the testimony , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute .
and Moses sp@@ ake to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cur@@ sed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses .
and ye shall hal@@ low the fif@@ ti@@ eth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jub@@ ile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
and if thy brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : ye@@ a , though he be a stranger , or a so@@ jour@@ ner ; that he may live with thee .
and if a so@@ jour@@ ner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwell@@ eth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or so@@ jour@@ ner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
ye shall make you no idols nor gra@@ ven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
I also will do this unto you ; I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be des@@ ol@@ ate .
and I will bring a sword upon you , that shall av@@ enge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pesti@@ l@@ ence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
if they shall confess their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the ini@@ qu@@ ity of their fathers , with their t@@ resp@@ ass which they t@@ resp@@ assed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised hearts be hum@@ bled , and they then accept of the punishment of their ini@@ qu@@ ity :
he shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
but if he sancti@@ fy his field after the jub@@ ile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jub@@ ile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month , and they declared their pedi@@ grees after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , by their polls .
so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
but the Lev@@ ites shall pitch round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Lev@@ ites shall keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the en@@ sign of their father 's house : far off about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall they pitch .
all that were numbered in the camp of Jud@@ ah were an hundred thousand and four@@ score thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
then the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Lev@@ ites in the midst of the camp : as they enc@@ amp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , where@@ with they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of Bad@@ gers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , where@@ with they minister about it , even the cens@@ ers , the fl@@ esh@@ hoo@@ ks , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of Bad@@ gers ' skins , and put to the st@@ aves of it .
and the hang@@ ings of the court , and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court , which is by the tab@@ ern@@ acle and by the altar round about , and their cor@@ ds , and all the instruments of their service , and all that is made for them : so shall they serve .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the priest .
and the priest shall set the woman before the LORD , and un@@ cover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that caus@@ eth the curse :
and the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to un@@ clean@@ ness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that caus@@ eth the curse :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
all the days of the vo@@ w of his separation there shall no r@@ as@@ or come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separ@@ at@@ eth himself unto the LORD , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an at@@ onement for him , for that he sin@@ ned by the dead , and shall hal@@ low his head that same day .
and he shall consec@@ rate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was de@@ filed .
and he shall offer his offering unto the LORD , one he lamb of the first year without bl@@ emish for a burnt offering , and one e@@ we lamb of the first year without bl@@ emish for a sin offering , and one ram without bl@@ emish for peace offerings ,
and the priest shall take the so@@ dden shoulder of the ram , and one un@@ leav@@ ened cake out of the basket , and one un@@ leav@@ ened w@@ af@@ er , and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazar@@ ite , after the hair of his separation is sha@@ ven :
and his offering was one silver charger , the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty she@@ k@@ els , one silver bowl of seventy she@@ k@@ els , after the she@@ kel of the sanctuary ; both of them were full of fine flour ming@@ led with oil for a meat offering :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ ab .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el the son of Z@@ u@@ ar .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Eli@@ ab the son of Hel@@ on .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Eliz@@ ur the son of She@@ de@@ ur .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Shel@@ um@@ iel the son of Zur@@ ish@@ add@@ ai .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Eli@@ as@@ ap@@ h the son of De@@ u@@ el .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Elis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ mi@@ hud .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Gam@@ ali@@ el the son of Ped@@ ah@@ z@@ ur .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Ab@@ id@@ an the son of G@@ ide@@ oni .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ add@@ ai .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Pag@@ iel the son of O@@ cr@@ an .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Ah@@ ira the son of En@@ an .
this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was ano@@ inted , by the princes of Israel : twelve char@@ gers of silver , twelve silver bow@@ ls , twelve spo@@ ons of gold :
and this work of the cand@@ les@@ tick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the LORD had sh@@ ew@@ ed Moses , so he made the cand@@ les@@ tick .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Lev@@ ites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Lev@@ ites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and those men said unto him , We are de@@ filed by the dead body of a man : W@@ herefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If any man of you or of your post@@ er@@ ity shall be un@@ clean by reason of a dead body , or be in a journey af@@ ar off , yet he shall keep the pas@@ sover unto the LORD .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cloud ab@@ ode , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their tents .
and so it was , when the cloud ab@@ ode from even unto the morning , and that the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they jour@@ ne@@ yed : whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up , they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tar@@ ried upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle , remaining there@@ on , the children of Israel ab@@ ode in their tents , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not : but when it was taken up , they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trum@@ pets ; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and Moses said unto Hob@@ ab , the son of R@@ agu@@ el the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ite , Moses ' father in law , We are jour@@ ne@@ ying unto the place of which the LORD said , I will give it you : come thou with us , and we will do thee good : for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in p@@ ans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
and the LORD said unto Moses , G@@ ather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou know@@ est to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thy@@ self alone .
and the LORD came down in a cloud , and sp@@ ake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophe@@ si@@ ed , and did not cease .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chew@@ ed , the wrath of the LORD was kind@@ led against the people , and the LORD smo@@ te the people with a very great plague .
and the LORD sp@@ ake suddenly unto Moses , and unto Aaron , and unto Mi@@ ri@@ am , Come out ye three unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation . and they three came out .
and he said , He@@ ar now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
the LORD is long@@ suffering , and of great mercy , for@@ giving ini@@ qu@@ ity and trans@@ g@@ ression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hear@@ k@@ ened to my voice ;
and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD , and their sin offering before the LORD , for their ignorance :
but the soul that do@@ eth ought presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same repro@@ ach@@ eth the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
seem@@ eth it but a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
so they G@@ at up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
but if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that ap@@ per@@ tain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD .
the cens@@ ers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar : for they offered them before the LORD , therefore they are hal@@ lowed : and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Take a cen@@ ser , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on inc@@ ense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an at@@ onement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the LORD ; the plague is begun .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on inc@@ ense , and made an at@@ onement for the people .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of Lev@@ i , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tab@@ ern@@ acle : only they shall not come ni@@ gh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , for all the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle : and a stranger shall not come ni@@ gh unto you .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be th@@ ine ; every one that is clean in th@@ ine house shall eat of it .
every thing that open@@ eth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the LORD , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be th@@ ine : nevertheless the fir@@ st@@ born of man shalt thou surely re@@ deem , and the fir@@ st@@ ling of un@@ clean beasts shalt thou re@@ deem .
but the Lev@@ ites shall do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
but the ti@@ thes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD , I have given to the Lev@@ ites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Am@@ ong the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus speak unto the Lev@@ ites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the ti@@ thes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering of it for the LORD , even a tenth part of the ti@@ the .
thus ye also shall offer an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD of all your ti@@ thes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's he@@ ave offering to Aaron the priest .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall ba@@ the his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that gather@@ eth the ashes of the hei@@ fer shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth among them , for a statute for ever .
and the clean person shall sprink@@ le upon the un@@ clean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall puri@@ fy himself , and wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people ab@@ ode in Kad@@ esh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sin@@ ned , for we have spoken against the LORD , and against thee ; pray unto the LORD , that he take away the ser@@ p@@ ents from us . and Moses prayed for the people .
and Israel smo@@ te him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Ar@@ non unto Jab@@ bo@@ k , even unto the children of Am@@ mon : for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
and Mo@@ ab said unto the elders of Mi@@ dian , Now shall this company l@@ ick up all that are round about us , as the ox l@@ ick@@ eth up the grass of the field . and Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or was king of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites at that time .
and Bal@@ a@@ am rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Bal@@ ak , Get you into your land : for the LORD ref@@ us@@ eth to give me leave to go with you .
and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and said to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
and God came unto Bal@@ a@@ am at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am smo@@ te the ass , to turn her into the way .
then the LORD opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the princes of Bal@@ ak .
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reck@@ oned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and Bal@@ ak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from wh@@ ence thou may@@ est see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from th@@ ence .
Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ az@@ ar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was z@@ eal@@ ous for my sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy .
and the sons of Eli@@ ab ; Nem@@ u@@ el , and Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am . this is that Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am , which were famous in the congregation , who stro@@ ve against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Kor@@ ah , when they stro@@ ve against the LORD :
and if his father have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kin@@ sman that is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment , as the LORD commanded Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet sav@@ our unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even : as the meat offering of the morning , and as the drink offering thereof , thou shalt offer it , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bul@@ locks , and one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year : they shall be unto you without bl@@ emish :
also in the day of the fir@@ st@@ fruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet sav@@ our ; one young bul@@ lock , one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without bl@@ emish :
these things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set fe@@ asts , beside your v@@ ows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meat offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings .
and they brought the cap@@ tives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Mo@@ ab , which are by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and lev@@ y a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the be@@ eves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
we have therefore brought an ob@@ lation for the LORD , what every man hath gotten , of jew@@ els of gold , chains , and brac@@ elets , rings , ear@@ rings , and tablets , to make an at@@ onement for our souls before the LORD .
for when they went up unto the valley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them .
and the LORD 's anger was kind@@ led against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the LORD , was consumed .
and Moses said unto them , If the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en will pass with you over Jordan , every man armed to battle , before the LORD , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad for a possession :
and Aaron the priest went up into mount H@@ or at the commandment of the LORD , and died there , in the forti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an with the co@@ asts thereof : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass on to Z@@ in : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kad@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ ne@@ a , and shall go on to Haz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , and pass on to Az@@ mon :
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the so@@ jour@@ ner among them : that every one that kill@@ eth any person un@@ awa@@ res may flee thi@@ ther .
or in enmity sm@@ ite him with his hand , that he die : he that smo@@ te him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the rev@@ enger of blood shall sl@@ ay the murderer , when he me@@ et@@ eth him .
and the congregation shall deliver the s@@ layer out of the hand of the rev@@ enger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whi@@ ther he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was ano@@ inted with the holy oil .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the s@@ layer shall return into the land of his possession .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it de@@ fil@@ eth the land : and the land C@@ AN@@ NOT be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother unto his daughters .
and when the jub@@ ile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe where@@ unto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
this is the thing which the LORD do@@ th command concerning the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
so I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over hundreds , and cap@@ tains over fif@@ ties , and cap@@ tains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God do@@ th give us .
and ye mur@@ mu@@ red in your tents , and said , Because the LORD hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the A@@ mor@@ ites , to destroy us .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD sp@@ ake unto me : and we comp@@ assed mount Se@@ ir many days .
med@@ dle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Se@@ ir unto Es@@ au for a possession .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of Es@@ au , which d@@ wel@@ t in Se@@ ir , through the way of the plain from El@@ ath , and from E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ gab@@ er , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Mo@@ ab .
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Ar@@ non : behold , I have given into th@@ ine hand Si@@ hon the A@@ mor@@ ite , king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
for only O@@ g king of Bash@@ an remained of the remn@@ ant of giants ; behold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is it not in Rab@@ bath of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cub@@ its was the length thereof , and four cub@@ its the breadth of it , after the cub@@ it of a man .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the river Ar@@ non , and half mount Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ ad@@ ites .
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou may@@ est prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , for ever .
on this side Jordan , in the valley over against B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or , in the land of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who d@@ wel@@ t at H@@ esh@@ bon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smo@@ te , after they were come forth out of Egypt :
thou shalt not bow down thy@@ self unto them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jeal@@ ous God , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
and the LORD heard the voice of your words , when ye sp@@ ake unto me ; and the LORD said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
but as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou may@@ est go in and possess the good land which the LORD sw@@ are unto thy fathers ,
but because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bond@@ men , from the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt .
the gra@@ ven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be sn@@ ared therein : for it is an ab@@ om@@ ination to the LORD thy God .
who fed thee in the wilderness with man@@ na , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
understand therefore this day , that the LORD thy God is he which go@@ eth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the LORD hath said unto thee .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you , then I ab@@ ode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the LORD said unto me , A@@ rise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a mol@@ ten image .
and I fell down before the LORD , as at the first , forty days and forty nights : I did neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all your sins which ye sin@@ ned , in doing w@@ ick@@ edly in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GO@@ D , destroy not thy people and th@@ ine inheritance , which thou hast re@@ deemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the LORD sp@@ ake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the LORD gave them unto me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ az@@ ar his son minist@@ ered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Lev@@ i , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hear@@ ken dilig@@ ently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and then the LORD 's wrath be kind@@ led against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gi@@ v@@ eth you .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall t@@ read upon , as he hath said unto you .
and ye shall overthrow their al@@ t@@ ars , and break their pillars , and burn their gro@@ ves with fire ; and ye shall he@@ w down the gra@@ ven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the LORD thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bond@@ age .
and there shall cle@@ ave n@@ ought of the cur@@ sed thing to th@@ ine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierc@@ eness of his anger , and sh@@ ew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
when thou shalt hear@@ ken to the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the clo@@ ven ho@@ of ; as the cam@@ el , and the h@@ are , and the Con@@ ey : for they chew the cu@@ d , but divide not the ho@@ of ; therefore they are un@@ clean unto you .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Th@@ ou shalt open th@@ ine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy ne@@ edy , in thy land .
thou shalt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy win@@ ep@@ ress : of that where@@ with the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy mai@@ d@@ servant thou shalt do likewise .
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
and the man that will do presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , and will not hear@@ ken unto the priest that stand@@ eth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou may@@ est not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : for@@ as@@ much as the LORD hath said unto you , Y@@ e shall h@@ ence@@ forth return no more that way .
according to all that thou desi@@ red@@ st of the LORD thy God in H@@ ore@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
when a prophet spe@@ ak@@ eth in the name of the LORD , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken , but the prophet hath spoken it presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously : thou shalt not be afraid of him .
when thou go@@ est out to battle against th@@ ine enemies , and se@@ est horses , and ch@@ ari@@ ots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall say unto them , He@@ ar , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not trem@@ ble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
and what man is he that hath planted a viney@@ ard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tribu@@ tar@@ ies unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the fir@@ st@@ born , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the fir@@ st@@ born is his .
if a man have a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have cha@@ st@@ ened him , will not hear@@ ken unto them :
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebelli@@ ous , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glut@@ ton , and a drun@@ k@@ ard .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
and , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tok@@ ens of my daughter 's vir@@ g@@ inity . and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
but unto the dam@@ sel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
thou shalt not bring the hire of a wh@@ ore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD thy God .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun go@@ eth down , that he may sleep in his own ra@@ iment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
when thou cut@@ test down th@@ ine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a she@@ af in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of th@@ ine hands .
and it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born which she be@@ areth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draw@@ eth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that sm@@ it@@ eth him , and put@@ t@@ eth forth her hand , and tak@@ eth him by the secrets :
therefore it shall be , when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all th@@ ine enemies round about , in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt b@@ lot out the rem@@ embrance of A@@ mal@@ ek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I prof@@ ess this day unto the LORD thy God , that I am come unto the country which the LORD sw@@ are unto our fathers for to give us .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and pl@@ ai@@ ster them with pl@@ ai@@ ster :
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over , that thou may@@ est go in unto the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey ; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
cur@@ sed be the man that mak@@ eth any gra@@ ven or mol@@ ten image , an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD , the work of the hands of the cra@@ fts@@ man , and put@@ t@@ eth it in a secret place . and all the people shall answer and say , A@@ men .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hear@@ ken dilig@@ ently unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy k@@ ine , and the f@@ locks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store@@ houses , and in all that thou sett@@ est th@@ ine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
and the LORD shall make thee pl@@ ent@@ eous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the LORD sw@@ are unto thy fathers to give thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wil@@ t not hear@@ ken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these cur@@ ses shall come upon thee , and over@@ take thee :
the LORD shall cause thee to be sm@@ it@@ ten before th@@ ine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the king@@ doms of the earth .
thou shalt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a viney@@ ard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
th@@ ine ox shall be sl@@ ain before th@@ ine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : th@@ ine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto th@@ ine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
therefore shalt thou serve th@@ ine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in n@@ ak@@ edness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a y@@ oke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of th@@ ine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enemies shall distress thee :
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your cap@@ tains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whi@@ ther the LORD thy God hath driven thee ,
if thou shalt hear@@ ken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul .
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Th@@ ou shalt not go over this Jordan .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the LORD thy God , he it is that do@@ th go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor for@@ sake thee .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Lev@@ i , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and the LORD said unto Moses , Be@@ hold , thy days approach that thou must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge . and Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall dis@@ til as the de@@ w , as the small rain upon the tender her@@ b , and as the showers upon the grass :
but Jes@@ hur@@ un wa@@ xed fat , and kicked : thou art wa@@ x@@ en fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fat@@ ness ; then he for@@ s@@ ook God which made him , and lightly este@@ em@@ ed the Rock of his salvation .
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
see now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will av@@ enge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be mer@@ ciful unto his land , and to his people .
get thee up into this mountain Ab@@ ari@@ m , unto mount Ne@@ bo , which is in the land of Mo@@ ab , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and behold the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
and this is the blessing of Jud@@ ah : and he said , He@@ ar , LORD , the voice of Jud@@ ah , and bring him unto his people : let his hands be sufficient for him ; and be thou an help to him from his enemies .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : sm@@ ite through the lo@@ ins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
happy art thou , O Israel : who is like unto thee , O people saved by the LORD , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excell@@ ency ! and th@@ ine enemies shall be found li@@ ars unto thee ; and thou shalt t@@ read upon their high places .
and the LORD said unto him , This is the land which I sw@@ are unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto thy seed : I have caused thee to see it with th@@ ine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thi@@ ther .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou may@@ est observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
wh@@ oso@@ ever he be that do@@ th rebel against thy commandment , and will not hear@@ ken unto thy words in all that thou command@@ est him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
for we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you , when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites , that were on the other side Jordan , Si@@ hon and O@@ g , whom ye utterly destroyed .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the LORD , since I have sh@@ ew@@ ed you kindness , that ye will also sh@@ ew kindness unto my father 's house , and give me a true token :
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua said , Her@@ e@@ by ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ites , and the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites .
and Joshua said unto them , Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel :
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
and this is the cause why Joshua did circum@@ c@@ ise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
and he said , N@@ ay ; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come . and Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , What sa@@ ith my lord unto his servant ?
and Joshua sent men from Jer@@ ich@@ o to A@@ i , which is beside B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ A@@ ven , on the east side of Be@@ the@@ l , and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed A@@ i .
and the men of A@@ i smo@@ te of them about thirty and six men : for they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even unto She@@ b@@ ari@@ m , and smo@@ te them in the going down : W@@ herefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
up , sancti@@ fy the people , and say , Sanc@@ ti@@ fy yourselves against to mor@@ row : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , There is an accur@@ sed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou can@@ st not stand before th@@ ine enemies , until ye take away the accur@@ sed thing from among you .
and he brought the family of Jud@@ ah ; and he took the family of the Zar@@ h@@ ites : and he brought the family of the Zar@@ h@@ ites man by man ; and Zab@@ di was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , was taken .
and Joshua said unto Ach@@ an , My son , give , I pray thee , glory to the LORD God of Israel , and make confession unto him ; and tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me .
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their li@@ ers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and ha@@ sted and set the city on fire .
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of whole stones , over which no man hath lift up any iron : and they offered there@@ on burnt offerings unto the LORD , and sacrificed peace offerings .
they did work wil@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gil@@ gal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
now therefore ye are cur@@ sed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bond@@ men , and he@@ w@@ ers of wood and draw@@ ers of water for the house of my God .
and the LORD delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
so Joshua took all that land , the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of Gos@@ hen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and the valley of the same ;
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smo@@ te , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Ar@@ non unto mount Her@@ mon , and all the plain on the east :
and from the plain to the sea of Chin@@ ner@@ o@@ th on the east , and unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea on the east , the way to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th ; and from the south , under Ash@@ do@@ th @@@ -@@ @ p@@ is@@ g@@ ah :
and re@@ igned in mount Her@@ mon , and in Sal@@ ca@@ h , and in all Bash@@ an , unto the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ acha@@ th@@ ites , and half Gil@@ e@@ ad , the border of Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon .
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ ad@@ ites , and the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
in the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites :
all the kingdom of O@@ g in Bash@@ an , which re@@ igned in Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and in E@@ dre@@ i , who remained of the remn@@ ant of the giants : for these did Moses sm@@ ite , and cast them out .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the wilderness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the utter@@ most part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the utter@@ most part of Jordan :
and the border comp@@ assed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ est@@ ward unto mount Se@@ ir , and passed along unto the side of mount j@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ek@@ ron nor@@ th@@ ward : and the border was drawn to Sh@@ ic@@ ron , and passed along to mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out unto Jab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ il@@ oh , and passed by it on the east to J@@ ano@@ ha@@ h ;
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of H@@ ep@@ her , the son of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mach@@ ir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mah@@ lah , and Noah , H@@ og@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and they came near before Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and before Joshua the son of N@@ un , and before the princes , saying , The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren . therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
and the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was from Ash@@ er to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah , that li@@ eth before Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ tap@@ pu@@ ah .
and the children of Joseph sp@@ ake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , for@@ as@@ much as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua sp@@ ake unto the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , Th@@ ou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
but the mountain shall be th@@ ine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the out@@ go@@ ings of it shall be th@@ ine : for thou shalt drive out the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , though they have iron ch@@ ari@@ ots , and though they be strong .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
but the Lev@@ ites have no part among you ; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance : and G@@ ad , and Re@@ ub@@ en , and half the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them .
and the border went over from th@@ ence toward Lu@@ z , to the side of Lu@@ z , which is Be@@ the@@ l , sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the border descended to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ ar , near the hill that li@@ eth on the south side of the ne@@ ther B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ mi@@ m , and descended to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
out of the portion of the children of Jud@@ ah was the inheritance of the children of Sim@@ eon : for the part of the children of Jud@@ ah was too much for them : therefore the children of Sim@@ eon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and then the coast tur@@ neth to Ram@@ ah , and to the strong city Ty@@ re ; and the coast tur@@ neth to Hos@@ ah ; and the out@@ go@@ ings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Ach@@ zi@@ b :
and the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tribe of Ash@@ er , and out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Bash@@ an , thirteen cities .
and out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the s@@ layer ; and Ham@@ moth @@@ -@@ @ DO@@ R with her suburbs , and K@@ art@@ an with her suburbs ; three cities .
and now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren , as he promised them : therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents , and unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan .
now to the one half of the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Moses had given possession in Bash@@ an : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan w@@ est@@ ward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sp@@ ake , it pleased them .
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cle@@ ave unto the remn@@ ant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jer@@ ich@@ o : and the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD .
and they for@@ s@@ ook the LORD God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the LORD to anger .
and the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spo@@ il@@ ers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
and yet they would not hear@@ ken unto their judges , but they went a wh@@ oring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obe@@ ying the commandments of the LORD ; but they did not so .
and when the LORD raised them up judges , then the LORD was with the judge , and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it rep@@ ented the LORD because of their gro@@ an@@ ings by reason of them that oppressed them and v@@ exed them .
namely , five lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Sid@@ onians , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in mount Lebanon , from mount Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Her@@ mon unto the entering in of Ham@@ ath .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ eb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Ch@@ ush@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Ch@@ ush@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised them up a deliver@@ er , Ehud the son of Ger@@ a , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a man lef@@ than@@ ded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto E@@ gl@@ on the king of Mo@@ ab .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parl@@ our were locked , they said , Su@@ rely he cover@@ eth his feet in his summer chamber .
and he said unto them , Fol@@ low after me : for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Mo@@ ab@@ ites into your hand . and they went down after him , and took the For@@ ds of Jordan toward Mo@@ ab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
and Bar@@ ak said unto her , If thou wil@@ t go with me , then I will go : but if thou wil@@ t not go with me , then I will not go .
How@@ be@@ it S@@ is@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite : for there was peace between Jab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
and Ja@@ el went out to meet S@@ is@@ era , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
and he said unto her , Gi@@ ve me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thir@@ sty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Mach@@ ir came down governors , and out of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah ; even Is@@ sac@@ har , and also Bar@@ ak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Re@@ ub@@ en there were great thoughts of heart .
curse ye Mer@@ oz , said the angel of the LORD , curse ye bit@@ terly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the LORD , to the help of the LORD against the mighty .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bond@@ age ;
and there came an angel of the LORD , and sat under an oak which was in O@@ ph@@ rah , that per@@ tained unto Jo@@ ash the Ab@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ rite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on thresh@@ ed wheat by the win@@ ep@@ ress , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bul@@ lock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the gro@@ ve which thou shalt cut down .
behold , I will put a fle@@ ece of wool in the floor ; and if the de@@ w be on the fle@@ ece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wil@@ t save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pit@@ ched beside the well of Har@@ od : so that the host of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites were on the north side of them , by the hill of More@@ h , in the valley .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Wh@@ oso@@ ever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gil@@ e@@ ad . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
and the LORD said unto G@@ ide@@ on , By the three hundred men that lap@@ ped will I save you , and deliver the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into th@@ ine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
so the people took vic@@ tu@@ als in their hand , and their trum@@ pets : and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Mi@@ dian was beneath him in the valley .
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
and the three companies blew the trum@@ pets , and brake the p@@ itch@@ ers , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trum@@ pets in their right hands to blow with@@ al : and they cried , The sword of the LORD , and of G@@ ide@@ on .
and the three hundred blew the trum@@ pets , and the LORD set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ it@@ tah in Zer@@ er@@ ath , and to the border of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ hol@@ ah , unto Tab@@ bath .
now Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ k@@ or , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
thus was Mi@@ dian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qui@@ et@@ ness forty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem unto his mother 's brethren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren sp@@ ake of him in the ears of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h ; for they said , He is our brother .
and he went unto his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ rah , and sle@@ w his brethren the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood in the top of mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hear@@ ken unto me , ye men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may hear@@ ken unto you .
and the br@@ am@@ ble said unto the trees , If in truth ye ano@@ int me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the br@@ am@@ ble , and dev@@ our the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon .
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sl@@ ain his sons , thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , the son of his mai@@ d@@ servant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ; )
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smo@@ te them .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and sle@@ w them .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his b@@ ough , and followed Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
and that year they v@@ exed and oppressed the children of Israel : eighteen years , all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which is in Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and Gil@@ e@@ ad 's wife bare him sons ; and his wife 's sons grew up , and they thrust out J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not inherit in our father 's house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
and the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , T@@ herefore we turn again to thee now , that thou may@@ est go with us , and fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gil@@ e@@ ad .
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over Gil@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad he passed over unto the children of Am@@ mon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and be@@ w@@ ail my vir@@ g@@ inity , I and my fellows .
and it came to pass at the end of two months , that she returned unto her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she knew no man . and it was a custom in Israel ,
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and the LORD delivered them into my hand : W@@ herefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah gathered together all the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and fought with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad smo@@ te E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , because they said , Y@@ e Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites are fu@@ gi@@ tives of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im among the E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites , and among the Man@@ ass@@ ites .
and the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites took the passages of Jordan before the E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites : and it was so , that when those E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites which were escaped said , Let me go over ; that the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto him , Art thou an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite ? if he said , N@@ ay ;
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no r@@ as@@ or shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazar@@ ite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
but he said unto me , Be@@ hold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any un@@ clean thing : for the child shall be a Nazar@@ ite to God from the womb to the day of his death .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Man@@ o@@ ah , Th@@ ough thou det@@ ain me , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wil@@ t offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the LORD . for Man@@ o@@ ah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD .
but his wife said unto him , If the LORD were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have sh@@ ew@@ ed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Tim@@ nat@@ h of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the car@@ case of the lion : and , behold , there was a s@@ warm of bees and honey in the car@@ case of the lion .
and Sam@@ son said unto them , I will now put forth a rid@@ dle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments :
and she we@@ pt before him the seven days , while their feast lasted : and it came to pass on the seventh day , that he told her , because she lay sore upon him : and she told the rid@@ dle to the children of her people .
then the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , Who hath done this ? and they answered , Sam@@ son , the son in law of the Tim@@ n@@ ite , because he had taken his wife , and given her to his companion . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came up , and burnt her and her father with fire .
and they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and Sam@@ son said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and they sp@@ ake unto him , saying , No ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee . and they bound him with two new cor@@ ds , and brought him up from the rock .
and he was sore ath@@ ir@@ st , and called on the LORD , and said , Th@@ ou hast given this great deliver@@ ance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ?
and she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to s@@ have off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to aff@@ l@@ ict him , and his strength went from him .
and she said , The Phil@@ ist@@ ines be upon thee , Sam@@ son . and he aw@@ oke out of his sleep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he w@@ ist not that the LORD was departed from him .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a gra@@ ven image and a mol@@ ten image : and they were in the house of Mic@@ ah .
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of La@@ ish , and said unto their brethren , Do ye know that there is in these houses an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and a gra@@ ven image , and a mol@@ ten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
and these went into Mic@@ ah 's house , and fetched the carved image , the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the mol@@ ten image . then said the priest unto them , What do ye ?
and he said , Y@@ e have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What ail@@ eth thee ?
and they took the things which Mic@@ ah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto La@@ ish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smo@@ te them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : How@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the gra@@ ven image : and Jonathan , the son of Ger@@ sh@@ om , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses sadd@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hi@@ ther into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and they turned aside thi@@ ther , to go in and to lodge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a way@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city : and the old man said , whi@@ ther go@@ est thou ? and wh@@ ence com@@ est thou ?
and he said unto him , We are passing from Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah toward the side of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; from th@@ ence am I : and I went to Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah , but I am now going to the house of the LORD ; and there is no man that recei@@ v@@ eth me to house .
behold , here is my daughter a mai@@ den , and his conc@@ ub@@ ine ; them I will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seem@@ eth good unto you : but unto this man do not so v@@ ile a thing .
( and the children of Israel went up and we@@ pt before the LORD until even , and asked counsel of the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? and the LORD said , Go up against him . )
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of God , and we@@ pt , and sat there before the LORD , and fast@@ ed that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were sm@@ it@@ ten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Ben@@ jam@@ ites , because they trusted unto the li@@ ers in wait which they had set beside Gi@@ be@@ ah .
then they said , Be@@ hold , there is a feast of the LORD in Sh@@ il@@ oh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that go@@ eth up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of Le@@ bon@@ ah .
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . and a certain man of Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah went to so@@ jour@@ n in the country of Mo@@ ab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kis@@ sed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
so Na@@ omi returned , and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Mo@@ ab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and she went , and came , and g@@ leaned in the field after the re@@ apers : and her H@@ AP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Bo@@ az , who was of the kind@@ red of E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h .
and she said , I pray you , let me g@@ lean and gather after the re@@ apers among the she@@ aves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tar@@ ried a little in the house .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in th@@ ine eyes , that thou shoul@@ dest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and Bo@@ az said unto her , At me@@ al@@ time come thou hi@@ ther , and eat of the bread , and dip thy mor@@ sel in the vin@@ eg@@ ar . and she sat beside the re@@ apers : and he reached her par@@ ched corn , and she did eat , and was suff@@ iced , and left .
and when Bo@@ az had eaten and drunk , and his heart was mer@@ ry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
then went Bo@@ az up to the gate , and sat him down there : and , behold , the kin@@ sman of whom Bo@@ az sp@@ ake came by ; unto whom he said , H@@ o , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here . and he turned aside , and sat down .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man pl@@ ucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Na@@ omi ; and they called his name O@@ bed : he is the father of Jes@@ se , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim @@@ -@@ @ z@@ op@@ him , of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of to@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite :
but Hann@@ ah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be we@@ an@@ ed , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the LORD , and there abide for ever .
and when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ locks , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Sh@@ il@@ oh : and the child was young .
and the man of th@@ ine , whom I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume th@@ ine eyes , and to gri@@ eve th@@ ine heart : and all the increase of th@@ ine house shall die in the flower of their age .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine ano@@ inted for ever .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was sm@@ it@@ ten before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and they sle@@ w of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and the messenger answered and said , Israel is fled before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sons also , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , are dead , and the ark of God is taken .
then said they , What shall be the t@@ resp@@ ass offering which we shall return to him ? they answered , Five golden emer@@ ods , and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
W@@ herefore ye shall make images of your emer@@ ods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : per@@ adventure he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and take the ark of the LORD , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jew@@ els of gold , which ye return him for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering , in a coff@@ er by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
and it came to pass , while the ark ab@@ ode in Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lam@@ ented after the LORD .
and they gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and drew water , and poured it out before the LORD , and fast@@ ed on that day , and said there , We have sin@@ ned against the LORD . and Samuel judged the children of Israel in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines drew near to battle against Israel : but the LORD thunder@@ ed with a great thunder on that day upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and dis@@ com@@ f@@ ited them ; and they were sm@@ it@@ ten before Israel .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hear@@ ken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and some shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
and he will appoint him cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over fif@@ ties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of Bec@@ hor@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a mighty man of power .
and when they were come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
then said Saul to his servant , But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God : what have we ?
and they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make ha@@ ste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and as for th@@ ine asses that were lost three days ago , set not thy mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then shalt thou go on forward from th@@ ence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tab@@ or , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Be@@ the@@ l , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three lo@@ aves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine :
and thou shalt go down before me to Gil@@ gal ; and , behold , I will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seven days shalt thou tar@@ ry , till I come to thee , and sh@@ ew thee what thou shalt do .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him be@@ fore@@ time saw that , behold , he prophe@@ si@@ ed among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of K@@ ish ? is Saul also among the prophets ?
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and the elders of Jab@@ esh said unto him , Gi@@ ve us seven days ' resp@@ ite , that we may send messengers unto all the co@@ asts of Israel : and then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee .
and when they for@@ g@@ at the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of S@@ is@@ era , captain of the host of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ ab , and they fought against them .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had sm@@ it@@ ten a gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and that Israel also was had in ab@@ om@@ ination with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gil@@ gal .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a str@@ ait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
and A@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , I @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ab@@ od 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of El@@ i , the LORD 's priest in Sh@@ il@@ oh , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the gar@@ rison , and the spo@@ il@@ ers , they also trem@@ bled , and the earth qu@@ aked : so it was a very great trembling .
and it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Saul said unto the priest , With@@ draw th@@ ine hand .
moreover the He@@ bre@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israel@@ ites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and I@@ shu@@ i , and Mel@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ ua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ ab , and the name of the younger Mic@@ h@@ al :
and Saul said unto the Ken@@ ites , Go , depart , get you down from among the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , lest I destroy you with them : for ye sh@@ ew@@ ed kindness to all the children of Israel , when they came up out of Egypt . so the Ken@@ ites departed from among the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the ox@@ en , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
then he said , I have sin@@ ned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
but the LORD said unto Samuel , Look not on his coun@@ tenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for the LORD se@@ eth not as man se@@ eth ; for man loo@@ ket@@ h on the outward appearance , but the LORD loo@@ ket@@ h on the heart .
and it came to pass , when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took an har@@ p , and played with his hand : so Saul was refresh@@ ed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
and David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jes@@ se had commanded him ; and he came to the t@@ rench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battle .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , G@@ oli@@ ath by name , out of the armies of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sp@@ ake according to the same words : and David heard them .
and David sp@@ ake to the men that stood by him , saying , What shall be done to the man that kill@@ eth this Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and tak@@ eth away the repro@@ ach from Israel ? for who is this un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised Phil@@ ist@@ ine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the LORD be with thee .
so David prevailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the she@@ ath thereof , and sle@@ w him , and cut off his head there@@ with . and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and Saul was very w@@ ro@@ th , and the saying dis@@ pleased him ; and he said , They have ascri@@ bed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascri@@ bed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commun@@ e with David secretly , and say , Be@@ hold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and Saul 's servants sp@@ ake those words in the ears of David . and David said , seem@@ eth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly este@@ em@@ ed ?
and Saul said , Th@@ us shall ye say to David , The king desi@@ re@@ th not any d@@ ow@@ ry , but an hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to be av@@ eng@@ ed of the king 's enemies . but Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Saul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
and David said unto Jonathan , Be@@ hold , to mor@@ row is the new moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
then Saul 's anger was kind@@ led against Jonathan , and he said unto him , Th@@ ou son of the perverse rebelli@@ ous woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jes@@ se to th@@ ine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother 's n@@ ak@@ edness ?
and as soon as the l@@ ad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kis@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , until David exceeded .
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , He@@ ar now , ye Ben@@ jam@@ ites ; will the son of Jes@@ se give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds ;
then A@@ him@@ elec@@ h answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and go@@ eth at thy bidding , and is hon@@ our@@ able in th@@ ine house ?
and the king said to Do@@ eg , Turn thou , and fall upon the priests . and Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite turned , and he fell upon the priests , and sle@@ w on that day four@@ score and five persons that did wear a linen ep@@ ho@@ d .
will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? O LORD God of Israel , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , tell thy servant . and the LORD said , He will come down .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife Ab@@ ig@@ ail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful coun@@ tenance : but the man was chur@@ lish and evil in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ eb .
and David said unto his men , G@@ ird ye on every man his sword . and they gir@@ ded on every man his sword ; and David also gir@@ ded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred ab@@ ode by the stuff .
now therefore know and consider what thou wil@@ t do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Beli@@ al , that a man C@@ AN@@ NOT speak to him .
then Ab@@ ig@@ ail made ha@@ ste , and took two hundred lo@@ aves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of par@@ ched corn , and an hundred clusters of ra@@ is@@ ins , and two hundred cakes of fi@@ gs , and laid them on asses .
and it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
I pray thee , forgive the t@@ resp@@ ass of th@@ ine hand@@ maid : for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fi@@ ght@@ eth the battles of the LORD , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and Ab@@ ig@@ ail ha@@ sted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then answered David and said to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the Hit@@ tite , and to Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , brother to Jo@@ ab , saying , Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? and Ab@@ is@@ hai said , I will go down with thee .
this thing is not good that thou hast done . as the LORD liv@@ eth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the LORD 's ano@@ inted . and now see where the king 's spe@@ ar is , and the cr@@ use of water that was at his bolster .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribu@@ lation .
and Ach@@ ish said , whi@@ ther have ye made a road to day ? and David said , Against the south of Jud@@ ah , and against the south of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ elites , and against the south of the Ken@@ ites .
W@@ herefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Z@@ ik@@ lag on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had invaded the south , and Z@@ ik@@ lag , and sm@@ it@@ ten Z@@ ik@@ lag , and burned it with fire ;
and David inqui@@ red at the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I pursue after this troop ? shall I over@@ take them ? and he answered him , Pur@@ sue : for thou shalt surely over@@ take them , and without fail recover all .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fast@@ ed until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and it came to pass after this , that David inqui@@ red of the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I go up into any of the cities of Jud@@ ah ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up . and David said , whi@@ ther shall I go up ? and he said , Un@@ to He@@ br@@ on .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad , and said unto them , Bless@@ ed be ye of the LORD , that ye have sh@@ ew@@ ed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : W@@ herefore that place was called Hel@@ k@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and they took up As@@ ah@@ el , and buried him in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Jo@@ ab and his men went all night , and they came to He@@ br@@ on at break of day .
and , Be@@ hold , the servants of David and Jo@@ ab came from pursuing a troop , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Ab@@ ner was not with David in He@@ br@@ on ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
and Saul 's son had two men that were cap@@ tains of bands : the name of the one was Ba@@ an@@ ah , and the name of the other Rec@@ hab , the sons of Rim@@ mon a Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , of the children of Benjamin : ( for Be@@ ero@@ th also was reck@@ oned to Benjamin :
and they brought the head of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth unto David to He@@ br@@ on , and said to the king , Be@@ hold the head of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth the son of Saul th@@ ine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the LORD hath av@@ eng@@ ed my lord the king this day of Saul , and of his seed .
and David commanded his young men , and they sle@@ w them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and han@@ ged them up over the pool in He@@ br@@ on . but they took the head of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth , and buried it in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on .
and David inqui@@ red of the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I go up to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? wil@@ t thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto David , Go up : for I will doub@@ tless deliver the Phil@@ ist@@ ines into th@@ ine hand .
and David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Ba@@ ale of Jud@@ ah , to bring up from th@@ ence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwell@@ eth between the cher@@ ub@@ ims .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab that was in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hio , the sons of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , dra@@ ve the new cart .
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ it@@ tite .
and they brought in the ark of the LORD , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tab@@ ern@@ acle that David had pit@@ ched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
and David said unto Mic@@ h@@ al , It was before the LORD , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD , over Israel : therefore will I play before the LORD .
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , I took thee from the she@@ ep@@ co@@ te , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel :
and I was with thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou w@@ ent@@ est , and have cut off all th@@ ine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit ini@@ qu@@ ity , I will cha@@ sten him with the rod of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men :
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , O Lord GO@@ D , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
of Syria , and of Mo@@ ab , and of the children of Am@@ mon , and of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and of A@@ mal@@ ek , and of the spoil of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er , son of Re@@ ho@@ b , king of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
and the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may sh@@ ew the kindness of God unto him ? and Zi@@ ba said unto the king , Jonathan hath yet a son , which is lame on his feet .
and the king said unto him , Where is he ? and Zi@@ ba said unto the king , Be@@ hold , he is in the house of Mach@@ ir , the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , in L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ deb@@ ar .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they stan@@ k before David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syrians of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syrians of Z@@ ob@@ a , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and of king Ma@@ ac@@ ah a thousand men , and of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ to@@ b twelve thousand men .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . so Jo@@ ab returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jerusalem .
and when all the kings that were servants to Had@@ are@@ zer saw that they were sm@@ it@@ ten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Am@@ mon any more .
and David said to Uri@@ ah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uri@@ ah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and I gave thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wives into thy bos@@ om , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Jud@@ ah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will raise up evil against thee out of th@@ ine own house , and I will take thy wives before th@@ ine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and ano@@ inted himself , and changed his app@@ arel , and came into the house of the LORD , and wor@@ shipped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he did eat .
and I , whi@@ ther shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from thee .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were vir@@ gins ap@@ pa@@ rel@@ led . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hath sl@@ ain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
for we must needs die , and are as water spil@@ t on the ground , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be gathered up again ; neither do@@ th God respect any person : yet do@@ th he devise means , that his ban@@ ished be not expelled from him .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hi@@ de not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Jo@@ ab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
and Jo@@ ab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Jo@@ ab said , To day thy servant know@@ eth that I have found grace in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
and it came to pass after forty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed unto the LORD , in He@@ br@@ on .
and lo Z@@ ad@@ ok also , and all the Lev@@ ites were with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God : and they set down the ark of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and the king said unto Z@@ ad@@ ok , Car@@ ry back the ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD , he will bring me again , and sh@@ ew me both it , and his hab@@ itation :
and David went up by the ascent of mount O@@ liv@@ et , and we@@ pt as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went b@@ are@@ foot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
and one told David , saying , A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el is among the conspir@@ ators with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el into fool@@ is@@ hness .
but if thou return to the city , and say unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father 's servant hitherto , so will I now also be thy servant : then may@@ est thou for me defeat the counsel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el .
and the king said , And where is thy master 's son ? and Zi@@ ba said unto the king , Be@@ hold , he ab@@ id@@ eth at Jerusalem : for he said , To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
then said the king to Zi@@ ba , Be@@ hold , th@@ ine are all that per@@ tained unto M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . and Zi@@ ba said , I hum@@ bly bes@@ e@@ ech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast re@@ igned ; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Ab@@ sal@@ om thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mis@@ chief , because thou art a bloody man .
then said Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
and the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah ? so let him curse , because the LORD hath said unto him , Cur@@ se David . who shall then say , W@@ herefore hast thou done so ?
and it came to pass , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , was come unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , God save the king , God save the king .
and Hus@@ hai said unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , N@@ ay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in th@@ ine own person .
and when Ab@@ sal@@ om 's servants came to the woman to the house , they said , Where is A@@ him@@ a@@ az and Jonathan ? and the woman said unto them , They be gone over the bro@@ ok of water . and when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , after they were departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David , and said unto David , A@@ rise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus hath A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el counsel@@ led against you .
and it came to pass , when David was come to Ma@@ han@@ aim , that Sho@@ bi the son of N@@ ah@@ ash of Rab@@ ba@@ h of the children of Am@@ mon , and Mach@@ ir the son of Am@@ mi@@ el of L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ deb@@ ar , and Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite of Rog@@ eli@@ m ,
and the king commanded Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai and It@@ tai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and all the people heard when the king gave all the cap@@ tains charge concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and Jo@@ ab said unto the man that told him , And , behold , thou saw@@ est him , and why did@@ st thou not sm@@ ite him there to the ground ? and I would have given thee ten she@@ k@@ els of silver , and a gir@@ dle .
then said Jo@@ ab , I may not tar@@ ry thus with thee . and he took three dar@@ ts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Ab@@ sal@@ om , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and Jo@@ ab said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not bear ti@@ dings this day , but thou shalt bear ti@@ dings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no ti@@ dings , because the king 's son is dead .
and the watch@@ man said , Me thin@@ ket@@ h the running of the foremost is like the running of A@@ him@@ a@@ az the son of Z@@ ad@@ ok . and the king said , He is a good man , and com@@ eth with good ti@@ dings .
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . and they told unto all the people , saying , Be@@ hold , the king do@@ th sit in the gate . and all the people came before the king : for Israel had fled every man to his tent .
and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . and Shim@@ ei the son of Ger@@ a fell down before the king , as he was come over Jordan ;
for thy servant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , W@@ herefore w@@ ent@@ est not thou with me , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ?
for all of my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet did@@ st thou set thy servant among them that did eat at th@@ ine own table . what right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and , behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said unto the king , Why have our brethren the men of Jud@@ ah stolen thee away , and have brought the king , and his household , and all David 's men with him , over Jordan ?
and when he was come near unto her , the woman said , Art thou Jo@@ ab ? and he answered , I am he . then she said unto him , He@@ ar the words of th@@ ine hand@@ maid . and he answered , I do hear .
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose . and the king said , I will give them .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h the daughter of Ai@@ ah , whom she bare unto Saul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ; and the five sons of Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Me@@ hol@@ ath@@ ite :
and there was again a battle in GO@@ B with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , where El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are @@@ -@@ @ ore@@ gi@@ m , a Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite , sle@@ w the brother of G@@ oli@@ ath the G@@ it@@ tite , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ aver 's beam .
and David sp@@ ake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and after him was Sham@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of l@@ enti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the LORD .
and he said , Be it far from me , O LORD , that I should do this : is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopar@@ dy of their lives ? therefore he would not drink it . these things did these three mighty men .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man , of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done many acts , he sle@@ w two lion@@ like men of Mo@@ ab : he went down also and sle@@ w a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he sle@@ w an Egyptian , a goo@@ dly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and pl@@ ucked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and sle@@ w him with his own spe@@ ar .
and they passed over Jordan , and pit@@ ched in A@@ ro@@ er , on the right side of the city that li@@ eth in the midst of the river of G@@ ad , and toward J@@ az@@ er :
and Jo@@ ab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Jud@@ ah were five hundred thousand men .
and David sp@@ ake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smo@@ te the people , and said , L@@ o , I have sin@@ ned , and I have done w@@ ick@@ edly : but these sheep , what have they done ? let th@@ ine hand , I pray thee , be against me , and against my father 's house .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah said , W@@ herefore is my lord the king come to his servant ? and David said , To buy the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of thee , to build an altar unto the LORD , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah said unto David , Let my lord the king take and offer up what seem@@ eth good unto him : behold , here be ox@@ en for burnt sacrifice , and thresh@@ ing instruments and other instruments of the ox@@ en for wood .
and his father had not dis@@ pleased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goo@@ dly man ; and his mother bare him after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and he hath sl@@ ain ox@@ en and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest , and Jo@@ ab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Jud@@ ah .
so Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mu@@ le , and brought him to Gi@@ hon .
and while he yet sp@@ ake , behold , Jonathan the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest came : and Ad@@ oni@@ jah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a val@@ i@@ ant man , and br@@ ing@@ est good ti@@ dings .
and the king hath sent with him Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mu@@ le :
and it was told Solomon , saying , Be@@ hold , Ad@@ oni@@ jah fe@@ areth king Solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not sl@@ ay his servant with the sword .
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not n@@ ay . and the king said unto her , As@@ k on , my mother : for I will not say thee n@@ ay .
and it was told king Solomon that Jo@@ ab was fled unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
and Ben@@ aiah came to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD , and said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , Come forth . and he said , N@@ ay ; but I will die here . and Ben@@ aiah brought the king word again , saying , Th@@ us said Jo@@ ab , and thus he answered me .
and the king said unto him , Do as he hath said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; that thou may@@ est take away the innocent blood , which Jo@@ ab shed , from me , and from the house of my father .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Jo@@ ab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the LORD .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shim@@ ei ran away unto Ach@@ ish son of Ma@@ acha@@ h king of G@@ ath . and they told Shim@@ ei , saying , Be@@ hold , thy servants be in G@@ ath .
and Solomon aw@@ oke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and the other woman said , N@@ ay ; but the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . and this said , No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . thus they sp@@ ake before the king .
then said the king , The one sa@@ ith , This is my son that liv@@ eth , and thy son is the dead : and the other sa@@ ith , N@@ ay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living .
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of Gil@@ e@@ ad , in the country of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , and of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
and , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD sp@@ ake unto David my father , saying , Th@@ y son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
the ne@@ ther@@ most chamber was five cub@@ its broad , and the middle was six cub@@ its broad , and the third was seven cub@@ its broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fast@@ ened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thi@@ ther : so that there was neither hammer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
and he built twenty cub@@ its on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of c@@ edar : he even built them for it within , even for the or@@ acle , even for the most holy place .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cub@@ its in length , and twenty cub@@ its in breadth , and twenty cub@@ its in the height thereof : and he over@@ laid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of c@@ edar .
and five cub@@ its was the one wing of the cher@@ u@@ b , and five cub@@ its the other wing of the cher@@ u@@ b : from the utter@@ most part of the one wing unto the utter@@ most part of the other were ten cub@@ its .
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bu@@ l , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made a por@@ ch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof thirty cub@@ its : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cub@@ it high : and on the top of the base the le@@ dges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the le@@ dges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he gra@@ ved cher@@ ub@@ ims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and Hir@@ am made the lav@@ ers , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . so Hir@@ am made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD :
and they drew out the st@@ aves , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen out in the holy place before the or@@ acle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
and I have set there a place for the ark , where@@ in is the covenant of the LORD , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his suppl@@ ication , O LORD my God , to hear@@ ken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant pra@@ y@@ eth before thee to day :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way where@@ in they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou know@@ est ; ( for thou , even thou only , know@@ est the hearts of all the children of men ; )
for thou did@@ st separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be th@@ ine inheritance , as thou sp@@ ak@@ est by the hand of Moses thy servant , when thou br@@ ough@@ test our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord GO@@ D .
blessed be the LORD , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
and Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the LORD , two and twenty thousand ox@@ en , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant , and for Israel his people .
( now Hir@@ am the king of Ty@@ re had furnished Solomon with c@@ edar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hir@@ am twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ ilee .
and this is the reason of the lev@@ y which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the LORD , and his own house , and Mill@@ o , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Haz@@ or , and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and Ge@@ zer .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond@@ men : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and his hor@@ sem@@ en .
and three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD , and he burnt inc@@ ense upon the altar that was before the LORD . so he finished the house .
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their app@@ arel , and his cu@@ p@@ bearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as was the heart of David his father .
and they arose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an : and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him vic@@ tu@@ als , and gave him land .
and when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the host was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
then Phar@@ aoh said unto him , But what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou see@@ k@@ est to go to th@@ ine own country ? and he answered , No@@ thing : How@@ be@@ it let me go in any wise .
and it came to pass at that time when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; and he had cl@@ ad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and he said to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , Take thee ten pieces : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel , Be@@ hold , I will ren@@ d the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Jud@@ ah , with the tribe of Benjamin , an hundred and four@@ score thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon .
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in Be@@ the@@ l the fif@@ teenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt inc@@ ense .
now there d@@ wel@@ t an old prophet in Be@@ the@@ l ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite .
and also Ma@@ acha@@ h his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a gro@@ ve ; and As@@ a destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad hear@@ k@@ ened unto king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ acha@@ h , and all Cin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
then king As@@ a made a pro@@ clamation throughout all Jud@@ ah ; none was exemp@@ ted : and they took away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and the timber thereof , where@@ with Ba@@ asha had buil@@ ded ; and king As@@ a built with them Ge@@ ba of Benjamin , and M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
for all the sins of Ba@@ asha , and the sins of E@@ lah his son , by which they sin@@ ned , and by which they made Israel to sin , in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their van@@ ities .
and he bought the hill Sam@@ aria of Sh@@ em@@ er for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Sh@@ em@@ er , owner of the hill , Sam@@ aria .
in his days did Hi@@ el the Beth@@ elite build Jer@@ ich@@ o : he laid the foundation thereof in A@@ bir@@ am his fir@@ st@@ born , and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Se@@ gu@@ b , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by Joshua the son of N@@ un .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel unto mount Car@@ me@@ l , and the prophets of Ba@@ al four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the gro@@ ves four hundred , which eat at J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel 's table .
and call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the LORD : and the God that answ@@ er@@ eth by fire , let him be God . and all the people answered and said , It is well spoken .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Ba@@ al , Choose you one bul@@ lock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the t@@ rench .
and he said , I have been very jeal@@ ous for the LORD God of hosts : for the children of Israel have for@@ s@@ aken thy covenant , thrown down th@@ ine al@@ t@@ ars , and sl@@ ain thy prophets with the sword ; and I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and A@@ hab said , By whom ? and he said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces . then he said , Who shall order the battle ? and he answered , Th@@ ou .
and the prophet came to the king of Israel , and said unto him , Go , strengthen thy self , and mark , and see what thou do@@ est : for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee .
then said he unto him , Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD , behold , as soon as thou art departed from me , a lion shall sl@@ ay thee . and as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and sle@@ w him .
and he said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for his life , and thy people for his people .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ hab heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ hab rose up to go down to the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
and the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets prophe@@ si@@ ed before them .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , Su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his ch@@ ari@@ ot against the Syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the ch@@ ari@@ ot .
and one washed the ch@@ ari@@ ot in the pool of Sam@@ aria ; and the dogs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they washed his arm@@ our ; according unto the word of the LORD which he sp@@ ake .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ hab , and all that he did , and the iv@@ ory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and there came down fire from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
and Elijah said unto Elis@@ ha , Tar@@ ry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Be@@ the@@ l . and Elis@@ ha said unto him , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . so they went down to Be@@ the@@ l .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Be@@ the@@ l came forth to Elis@@ ha , and said unto him , Know@@ est thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he said , Y@@ ea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Elis@@ ha , tar@@ ry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jer@@ ich@@ o . and he said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . so they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Jer@@ ich@@ o came to Elis@@ ha , and said unto him , Know@@ est thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he answered , Y@@ ea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Tar@@ ry , I pray thee , here ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan . and he said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . and they two went on .
and it came to pass , when they were gone over , that Elijah said unto Elis@@ ha , As@@ k what I shall do for thee , before I be taken away from thee . and Elis@@ ha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
and Elis@@ ha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ sem@@ en thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah do@@ th rest on Elis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Jud@@ ah , and the king of E@@ dom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD , that we may inqu@@ ire of the LORD by him ? and one of the king of Israel 's servants answered and said , Here is Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at , which poured water on the hands of Elijah .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and when the king of Mo@@ ab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even unto the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
and Ge@@ haz@@ i passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . W@@ herefore he went again to meet him , and told him , saying , The child is not aw@@ aked .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child wa@@ xed warm .
and Elis@@ ha came again to Gil@@ gal : and there was a de@@ ar@@ th in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and see@@ the pot@@ tage for the sons of the prophets .
and the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of ra@@ iment .
and it was so , when Elis@@ ha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , W@@ herefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
but Na@@ aman was w@@ ro@@ th , and went away , and said , Be@@ hold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the le@@ per .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
and the man of God said , Where fell it ? and he sh@@ ew@@ ed him the place . and he cut down a stick , and cast it in thi@@ ther ; and the iron did swim .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not sh@@ ew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host comp@@ assed the city both with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots . and his servant said unto him , Al@@ as , my master ! how shall we do ?
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Be@@ hold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
and they rose up in the tw@@ ilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the utter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people tro@@ de upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who sp@@ ake when the king came down to him .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that he took a thick cloth , and di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Haz@@ ael re@@ igned in his stead .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ hab : for the daughter of A@@ hab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the LORD .
and thou shalt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ hab thy master , that I may av@@ enge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the LORD , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
and he said , Th@@ row her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprink@@ led on the wall , and on the horses : and he tro@@ de her under foot .
W@@ herefore they came again , and told him . and he said , This is the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by his servant Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , saying , In the portion of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el shall dogs eat the flesh of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel :
and there came a messenger , and told him , saying , They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . and he said , L@@ ay ye them in two he@@ aps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Y@@ e be righteous : behold , I con@@ spi@@ red against my master , and sle@@ w him : but who sle@@ w all these ?
and the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the cap@@ tains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the LORD , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD , and sh@@ ew@@ ed them the king 's son .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and he brought forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and ano@@ inted him ; and they cl@@ apped their hands , and said , God save the king .
then king Je@@ ho@@ ash called for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
How@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the LORD bow@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , bas@@ ons , trum@@ pets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD :
and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ ael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the son of Haz@@ ael , all their days .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD ; he departed not from all the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might where@@ with he fought against Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elis@@ ha was fallen sick of his sickness where@@ of he died . and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down unto him , and we@@ pt over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ sem@@ en thereof .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz took again out of the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the son of Haz@@ ael the cities , which he had taken out of the hand of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz his father by war . three times did Jo@@ ash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
thou hast indeed sm@@ it@@ ten E@@ dom , and th@@ ine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tar@@ ry at home : for why shoul@@ dest thou med@@ dle to thy hurt , that thou shoul@@ dest fall , even thou , and Jud@@ ah with thee ?
and Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im unto the corner gate , four hundred cub@@ its .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Sam@@ aria .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
and the LORD smo@@ te the king , so that he was a le@@ per unto the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house . and Jo@@ th@@ am the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
this was the word of the LORD which he sp@@ ake unto Je@@ hu , saying , Th@@ y sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
and Men@@ a@@ hem exac@@ ted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , to give to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . so the king of As@@ sy@@ ria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
so A@@ haz sent messengers to Tig@@ l@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ es@@ er king of As@@ sy@@ ria , saying , I am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Phar@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat king : and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am dra@@ ve Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Ab@@ i , the daughter of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves , and brake in pieces the br@@ as@@ en ser@@ pent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn inc@@ ense to it : and he called it Ne@@ h@@ ush@@ tan .
at that time did He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD , and from the pillars which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of As@@ ap@@ h the recorder .
then said Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and She@@ b@@ na , and Jo@@ ah , unto R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the Jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
then R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria :
hear@@ ken not to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for thus sa@@ ith the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fi@@ g tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his ci@@ stern :
then came Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of As@@ ap@@ h the recorder , to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and they said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebu@@ ke , and bl@@ asph@@ emy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and Isaiah said unto them , Th@@ us shall ye say to your master , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
now therefore , O LORD our God , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the king@@ doms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God , even thou only .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as corn b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , Y@@ e shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which spring@@ eth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah unto Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . and he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchan@@ tments , and dealt with familiar spirits and w@@ izards : he wrought much w@@ ick@@ edness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Jud@@ ah ?
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest said unto Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hil@@ ki@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Jud@@ ah hath read :
because they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have burned inc@@ ense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kind@@ led against this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
and as Jo@@ si@@ ah turned himself , he sp@@ ied the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res that were there in the mount , and sent , and took the bones out of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , and burned them upon the altar , and polluted it , according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
surely there was not Hol@@ den such a pas@@ sover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Jud@@ ah ;
and Phar@@ aoh @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h put him in bands at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
and the LORD sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Jud@@ ah to destroy it , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by his servants the prophets .
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river E@@ uph@@ rates all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
and he carried away Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into cap@@ tivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pit@@ ched against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cub@@ its , and the chap@@ iter upon it was brass : and the height of the chap@@ iter three cub@@ its ; and the wre@@ a@@ then work , and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates upon the chap@@ iter round about , all of brass : and like unto these had the second pillar with wre@@ a@@ then work .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ es that were with him at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
now the sons of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah , Abraham 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : she bare Zim@@ ran , and Jo@@ k@@ shan , and Med@@ an , and Mi@@ dian , and I@@ sh@@ b@@ ak , and Shu@@ ah . and the sons of Jo@@ k@@ shan ; She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an .
and when Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Han@@ an was dead , had@@ ad re@@ igned in his stead : and the name of his city was P@@ ai ; and his wife 's name was Me@@ het@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Me@@ z@@ a@@ hab .
and he took G@@ es@@ hu@@ r , and A@@ ram , with the towns of J@@ air , from them , with Ken@@ ath , and the towns thereof , even thre@@ es@@ core cities . all these belonged to the sons of Mach@@ ir the father of Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and their brethren of the house of their fathers were , Michael , and M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , and She@@ ba , and Jor@@ ai , and J@@ ach@@ an , and Z@@ ia , and He@@ ber , seven .
and to the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ om throughout their families out of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tribe of Ash@@ er , and out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and out of the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Bash@@ an , thirteen cities .
all these were the children of Ash@@ er , heads of their father 's house , choice and mighty men of val@@ our , chief of the princes . and the number throughout the gen@@ eal@@ ogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
and the sons of U@@ lam were mighty men of val@@ our , arch@@ ers , and had many sons , and sons ' sons , an hundred and fifty . all these are of the sons of Benjamin .
and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ jah , and Ma@@ asi@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of J@@ ah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ em@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ aiah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of As@@ a , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou w@@ ast he that le@@ dd@@ est out and br@@ ough@@ test in Israel : and the LORD thy God said unto thee , Th@@ ou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
he was with David at P@@ as @@@ -@@ @ dam@@ mi@@ m , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where was a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the three brake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the LORD ,
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done many acts ; he sle@@ w two lion@@ like men of Mo@@ ab : also he went down and sle@@ w a lion in a pit in a snow@@ y day .
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ lag , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and J@@ edi@@ ael , and Michael , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and Eli@@ hu , and Z@@ il@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of the thousands that were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
and of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to He@@ br@@ on , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and David went up , and all Israel , to Ba@@ al@@ ah , that is , to Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , which belonged to Jud@@ ah , to bring up th@@ ence the ark of God the LORD , that dwell@@ eth between the cher@@ ub@@ ims , whose name is called on it .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the Lev@@ ites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of mus@@ ick , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ mb@@ als , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
and with them their brethren of the second degree , Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , Ben , and Ja@@ az@@ iel , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ el@@ eh , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , the porters .
and She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and A@@ mas@@ ai , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Ben@@ aiah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , the priests , did blow with the trum@@ pets before the ark of God : and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom and Je@@ hi@@ ah were door@@ keepers for the ark .
and David was clo@@ thed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Lev@@ ites that bare the ark , and the singers , and Chen@@ ani@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ep@@ ho@@ d of linen .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
As@@ ap@@ h the chief , and next to him Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , J@@ ei@@ el , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom : and J@@ ei@@ el with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and with har@@ ps ; but As@@ ap@@ h made a sound with cy@@ mb@@ als ;
to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD , which he commanded Israel ;
and with them h@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the LORD , because his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever ;
and I have been with thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou hast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
them also king David dedicated unto the LORD , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ ab , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with s@@ aws , and with har@@ rows of iron , and with axes . even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Am@@ mon . and David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
and David said to Jo@@ ab and to the rulers of the people , Go , number Israel from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
and Jo@@ ab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Jud@@ ah was four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand men that drew sword .
and David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders of Israel , who were clo@@ thed in s@@ ack@@ cloth , fell upon their faces .
then David said to Or@@ nan , Grant me the place of this thresh@@ ing@@ floor , that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD : thou shalt grant it me for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Or@@ nan said unto David , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes : lo , I give thee the ox@@ en also for burnt offerings , and the thresh@@ ing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; I give it all .
behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and qui@@ et@@ ness unto Israel in his days .
is not the LORD your God with you ? and hath he not given you rest on every side ? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand ; and the land is subdued before the LORD , and before his people .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sab@@ baths , in the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the LORD :
of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n : the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n ; G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , and Z@@ eri , and Jes@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , six , under the hands of their father J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , who prophe@@ si@@ ed with a har@@ p , to give thanks and to praise the LORD .
and all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Saul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ ab the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated ; and wh@@ oso@@ ever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shel@@ om@@ ith , and of his brethren .
and of the He@@ bron@@ ites , H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah and his brethren , men of val@@ our , a thousand and seven hundred , were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan w@@ est@@ ward in all the business of the LORD , and in the service of the king .
and over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the store@@ houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Je@@ hon@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the por@@ ch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treas@@ uries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parl@@ ours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every cand@@ les@@ tick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks of silver by weight , both for the cand@@ les@@ tick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every cand@@ les@@ tick .
th@@ ine , O LORD , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the maj@@ esty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is th@@ ine ; th@@ ine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD , and the king .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD , on the mor@@ row after that day , even a thousand bul@@ locks , a thousand r@@ ams , and a thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
then Solomon sp@@ ake unto all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
Hur@@ am said moreover , Bless@@ ed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endu@@ ed with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
and he set thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and four@@ score thousand to be he@@ w@@ ers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred over@@ se@@ ers to set the people a work .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cub@@ its after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cub@@ its , and the breadth twenty cub@@ its .
and he made the most holy house , the length where@@ of was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof twenty cub@@ its : and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and under it was the simil@@ itude of ox@@ en , which did compass it round about : ten in a cub@@ it , comp@@ assing the sea round about . two rows of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
and the sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , and the bas@@ ons , and the spo@@ ons , and the cens@@ ers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
hear@@ ken therefore unto the suppl@@ ications of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou he@@ arest , forgive .
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , where@@ in they should walk ; and send rain upon thy land , which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance .
and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the LORD upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pav@@ ement , and wor@@ shipped , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever .
moreover Solomon hal@@ lowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the br@@ as@@ en altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and mer@@ ry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had sh@@ ew@@ ed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosper@@ ously effected .
and the LORD appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
then will I pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sancti@@ fied for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all nations .
and this house , which is high , shall be an aston@@ ishment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sab@@ baths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the solemn fe@@ asts , three times in the year , even in the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ acles .
and Hur@@ am sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to O@@ ph@@ ir , and took th@@ ence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and it came to pass , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who was in Egypt , whi@@ ther he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , E@@ ase somewhat the y@@ oke that thy father did put upon us ?
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
then came Sh@@ em@@ aiah the prophet to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and to the princes of Jud@@ ah , that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Sh@@ is@@ hak , and said unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e have for@@ s@@ aken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak .
and when the LORD saw that they hum@@ bled themselves , the word of the LORD came to Sh@@ em@@ aiah , saying , They have hum@@ bled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliver@@ ance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak .
so Sh@@ is@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
now the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , first and last , are they not written in the book of Sh@@ em@@ aiah the prophet , and of Id@@ do the se@@ er concerning gene@@ alo@@ gies ? and there were wars between Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am continually .
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden cal@@ ves , which J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am made you for gods .
and As@@ a had an army of men that bare targets and spe@@ ars , out of Jud@@ ah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shi@@ elds and drew b@@ ows , two hundred and four@@ score thousand : all these were mighty men of val@@ our .
and at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the LORD thy God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of th@@ ine hand .
therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , Sh@@ all we go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad to battle , or shall I for@@ bear ? and they said , Go up ; for God will deliver it into the king 's hand .
and the messenger that went to call Mic@@ aiah sp@@ ake to him , saying , Be@@ hold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one ass@@ ent ; let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good .
and the LORD said , Who shall enti@@ ce A@@ hab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad ? and one sp@@ ake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they comp@@ assed about him to fight : but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out , and the LORD helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his ch@@ ari@@ ot man , Turn th@@ ine hand , that thou may@@ est carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and said , O LORD God of our fathers , art not thou God in heaven ? and rul@@ est not thou over all the king@@ doms of the he@@ a@@ then ? and in th@@ ine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
and he said , hear@@ ken ye , all Jud@@ ah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou king Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD unto you , Be not afraid nor dis@@ may@@ ed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
and when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the LORD , and that should praise the beauty of hol@@ iness , as they went out before the army , and to say , P@@ raise the LORD ; for his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Ber@@ acha@@ h ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Ber@@ acha@@ h , unto this day .
How@@ be@@ it the LORD would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a wh@@ oring , like to the wh@@ ore@@ doms of the house of A@@ hab , and also hast sl@@ ain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than thy@@ self :
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . How@@ be@@ it they buried him in the city of David , but not in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , Be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
but let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests , and they that minister of the Lev@@ ites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada and his sons ano@@ inted him , and said , God save the king .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to w@@ it , with all the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Jud@@ ah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
but the soldiers of the army which Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Jud@@ ah , from Sam@@ aria even unto B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on , and smo@@ te three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
W@@ herefore the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Ama@@ zi@@ ah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of th@@ ine hand ?
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah took advice , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us see one another in the face .
thou say@@ est , L@@ o , thou hast sm@@ it@@ ten the E@@ dom@@ ites ; and th@@ ine heart lif@@ t@@ eth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shoul@@ dest thou med@@ dle to th@@ ine hurt , that thou shoul@@ dest fall , even thou , and Jud@@ ah with thee ?
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Sam@@ aria .
and he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brake down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of Jab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d , and built cities about Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah had an host of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of J@@ ei@@ el the scri@@ be and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the ruler , under the hand of Han@@ ani@@ ah , one of the king 's cap@@ tains .
and Az@@ ari@@ ah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon him , and , behold , he was le@@ pr@@ ous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from th@@ ence ; ye@@ a , himself ha@@ sted also to go out , because the LORD had sm@@ it@@ ten him .
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per unto the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a le@@ per : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ igned in his stead .
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , after the ab@@ om@@ inations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for bond@@ men and bond@@ women unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
then certain of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ z@@ ki@@ ah the son of Sh@@ all@@ um , and A@@ mas@@ a the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against them that came from the war ,
and said unto them , He@@ ar me , ye Lev@@ ites , sancti@@ fy now yourselves , and sancti@@ fy the house of the LORD God of your fathers , and carry forth the fil@@ thiness out of the holy place .
for our fathers have t@@ resp@@ assed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have for@@ s@@ aken him , and have turned away their faces from the hab@@ itation of the LORD , and turned their backs .
then they went in to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king , and said , We have cleans@@ ed all the house of the LORD , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the sh@@ ew@@ bread table , with all the vessels thereof .
and they brought seven bul@@ locks , and seven r@@ ams , and seven lam@@ bs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for Jud@@ ah . and he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD .
and he set the Lev@@ ites in the house of the LORD with cy@@ mb@@ als , with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with har@@ ps , according to the commandment of David , and of G@@ ad the king 's se@@ er , and Na@@ than the prophet : for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets .
now be ye not sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the LORD , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sancti@@ fied for ever : and serve the LORD your God , that the fierc@@ eness of his wrath may turn away from you .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprink@@ led the blood , which they received of the hand of the Lev@@ ites .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sp@@ ake comfortably unto all the Lev@@ ites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers .
and all the congregation of Jud@@ ah , with the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Jud@@ ah , rejo@@ iced .
and concerning the children of Israel and Jud@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Jud@@ ah , they also brought in the ti@@ the of ox@@ en and sheep , and the ti@@ the of holy things which were consec@@ rated unto the LORD their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
and next him were Eden , and Min@@ i@@ amin , and Jes@@ hua , and Sh@@ em@@ aiah , A@@ mari@@ ah , and Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small :
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
How@@ be@@ it in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inqu@@ ire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and when he had broken down the al@@ t@@ ars and the gro@@ ves , and had beaten the gra@@ ven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had pur@@ ged the land , and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the recorder , to repair the house of the LORD his God .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the work@@ men that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Jud@@ ah :
behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall th@@ ine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Lev@@ ites .
and his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Lev@@ ites : Hil@@ ki@@ ah and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah and Je@@ hi@@ el , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the pas@@ sover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle , and three hundred ox@@ en .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the LORD , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the ox@@ en .
and they ro@@ asted the pas@@ sover with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other holy offerings so@@ d they in pots , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ ed@@ ily among all the people .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busi@@ ed in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Lev@@ ites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
nevertheless Jo@@ si@@ ah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hear@@ k@@ ened not unto the words of N@@ echo from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the valley of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ om@@ inations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ igned in his stead .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
then rose up the chief of the fathers of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , with all them whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
then stood up Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and his brethren the priests , and Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , and his brethren , and buil@@ ded the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings there@@ on , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD , they set the priests in their app@@ arel with trum@@ pets , and the Lev@@ ites the sons of As@@ ap@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , to praise the LORD , after the ordin@@ ance of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Lev@@ ites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
then wrote Re@@ h@@ um the chancellor , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and the rest of their companions ; the Din@@ a@@ ites , the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ath@@ ch@@ ites , the Tar@@ pel@@ ites , the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ sites , the Arch@@ ev@@ ites , the Bab@@ yl@@ onians , the Sus@@ anch@@ ites , the De@@ ha@@ v@@ ites , and the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
now when the copy of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and their companions , they went up in ha@@ ste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then the prophets , H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Id@@ do , prophe@@ si@@ ed unto the Jews that were in Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
at the same time came to them Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and their companions , and said thus unto them , Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
the copy of the letter that Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and his companions the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ach@@ ites , which were on this side the river , sent unto D@@ arius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , the Chal@@ dean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bul@@ locks , two hundred r@@ ams , four hundred lam@@ bs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
this E@@ z@@ ra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scri@@ be in the law of Moses , which the LORD God of Israel had given : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Lev@@ ites , in my realm , which are minded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for J@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and for M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , men of understanding .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of A@@ ha@@ va , that we might aff@@ l@@ ict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the LORD .
then we departed from the river of A@@ ha@@ va on the twel@@ fth day of the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have ming@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass .
now when E@@ z@@ ra had prayed , and when he had confessed , we@@ eping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people we@@ pt very sore .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and his brethren ; Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and J@@ ari@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my coun@@ tenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , li@@ eth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
and the king said unto me , ( the queen also sitting by him , ) For how long shall thy journey be ? and when wil@@ t thou return ? so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it griev@@ ed them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and the rulers knew not whi@@ ther I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
then said I unto them , Y@@ e see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem li@@ eth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a repro@@ ach .
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they buil@@ ded the sheep gate ; they sancti@@ fied it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Me@@ ah they sancti@@ fied it , unto the tower of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el .
and next unto them repaired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of Uri@@ jah , the son of Ko@@ z . and next unto them repaired M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ el . and next unto them repaired Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana .
moreover the old gate repaired Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah , and M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
but the d@@ ung gate repaired Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Rec@@ hab , the ruler of part of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ h@@ acc@@ er@@ em ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Ped@@ aiah the son of Par@@ osh .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebu@@ ked the no@@ bles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Y@@ e exact us@@ ury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
then said they , We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do as thou say@@ est . then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , beside forty she@@ k@@ els of silver ; ye@@ a , even their servants bare rule over the people : but so did not I , because of the fear of God .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Jud@@ ah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the he@@ a@@ then that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
who came with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , Jes@@ hua , Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah , Az@@ ari@@ ah , Ra@@ am@@ i@@ ah , N@@ ah@@ am@@ ani , Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Bil@@ shan , Mis@@ per@@ eth , B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai , Ne@@ h@@ um , Ba@@ an@@ ah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tir@@ sha@@ tha gave to the treasure a thousand dr@@ ams of gold , fifty bas@@ ons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed the LORD , the great God . and all the people answered , A@@ men , A@@ men , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves boo@@ ths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and thou did@@ st divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persec@@ utors thou thre@@ west into the de@@ eps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou le@@ dd@@ est them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way where@@ in they should go .
moreover thou g@@ av@@ est them king@@ doms and nations , and did@@ st divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Si@@ hon , and the land of the king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an .
and the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Lev@@ ites , when the Lev@@ ites take ti@@ thes : and the Lev@@ ites shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ thes unto the house of our God , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
now these are the chief of the province that d@@ wel@@ t in Jerusalem : but in the cities of Jud@@ ah d@@ wel@@ t every one in his possession in their cities , to w@@ it , Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Pash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah ,
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
the over@@ se@@ er also of the Lev@@ ites at Jerusalem was Uz@@ zi the son of B@@ ani , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the son of M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ha . of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h , the singers were over the business of the house of God .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Jud@@ ah d@@ wel@@ t at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , and in the villages thereof , and at Di@@ bon , and in the villages thereof , and at J@@ ek@@ ab@@ ze@@ el , and in the villages thereof ,
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ ab@@ ite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
and I commanded the Lev@@ ites that they should clean@@ se themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sancti@@ fy the sab@@ bath day . remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was mer@@ ry with wine , he commanded Me@@ human , Biz@@ tha , Har@@ bon@@ a , B@@ ig@@ tha , and Ab@@ ag@@ tha , Z@@ eth@@ ar , and Car@@ c@@ as , the seven Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains that served in the presence of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us the king ,
and Mem@@ uc@@ an answered before the king and the princes , V@@ ash@@ ti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall desp@@ ise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us commanded V@@ ash@@ ti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ esh , of those which kept the door , were w@@ ro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and when inqui@@ sition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ icles before the king .
then called Es@@ ther for Hat@@ ach , one of the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to know what it was , and why it was .
and the king said unto Es@@ ther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
if I have found favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and Ham@@ an come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said .
and Ham@@ an told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
then the king said to Ham@@ an , Make ha@@ ste , and take the app@@ arel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , that sit@@ t@@ eth at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken .
then took Ham@@ an the app@@ arel and the horse , and ar@@ ra@@ yed Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and brought him on horse@@ back through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , Th@@ us shall it be done unto the man whom the king deli@@ ght@@ eth to honour .
and the king said again unto Es@@ ther on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , queen Es@@ ther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
for we are sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be sl@@ ain , and to perish . but if we had been sold for bond@@ men and bond@@ women , I had held my tongue , although the enemy could not counter@@ v@@ ail the king 's damage .
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Ham@@ an stood up to make request for his life to Es@@ ther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
and Es@@ ther sp@@ ake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him with tears to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai went out from the presence of the king in royal app@@ arel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a garment of fine linen and purple : and the city of Sh@@ ush@@ an rejo@@ iced and was glad .
therefore the Jews of the villages , that d@@ wel@@ t in the un@@ w@@ alled towns , made the four@@ teenth day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gl@@ ad@@ ness and fe@@ asting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , where@@ unto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand cam@@ els , and five hundred y@@ oke of ox@@ en , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The fire of God is fallen from heaven , and hath burned up the sheep , and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The Chal@@ de@@ ans made out three bands , and fell upon the cam@@ els , and have carried them away , ye@@ a , and sl@@ ain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
and , behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and smo@@ te the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
and said , N@@ aked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thi@@ ther : the LORD gave , and the LORD hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the LORD .
but he said unto her , Th@@ ou spe@@ ak@@ est as one of the foolish women spe@@ ak@@ eth . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? in all this did not Job sin with his lips .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
they are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pray unto thee in a time when thou may@@ est be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come ni@@ gh unto him .
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : ye@@ a , let them say continually , Let the LORD be magni@@ fied , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
by terrible things in righteousness wil@@ t thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
rebu@@ ke the company of spear@@ men , the multitude of the bul@@ ls , with the cal@@ ves of the people , till every one submit himself with pieces of silver : sc@@ atter thou the people that delight in war .
if thou say@@ est , Be@@ hold , we knew it not ; do@@ th not he that pon@@ der@@ eth the heart consider it ? and he that keep@@ eth thy soul , do@@ th not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
th@@ ine own friend , and thy father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into thy brother 's house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
who hath asc@@ ended up into heaven , or descended ? who hath gathered the wind in his fi@@ sts ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? what is his name , and what is his son 's name , if thou can@@ st tell ?
I commun@@ ed with mine own heart , saying , L@@ o , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : ye@@ a , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
for there is no rem@@ embrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how Di@@ eth the wise man ? as the fool .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
so I returned , and considered all the op@@ pressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall w@@ ick@@ edness deliver those that are given to it .
then I commended mir@@ th , because a man hath no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be mer@@ ry : for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God gi@@ v@@ eth him under the sun .
for man also know@@ eth not his time : as the f@@ ishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are ; so are the sons of men sn@@ ared in an evil time , when it fall@@ eth suddenly upon them .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fall@@ eth , there it shall be .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of Shen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
bring no more vain ob@@ l@@ ations ; inc@@ ense is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto me ; the new mo@@ ons and sab@@ baths , the calling of assemblies , I C@@ AN@@ NOT away with ; it is ini@@ qu@@ ity , even the solemn meeting .
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the mol@@ es and to the b@@ ats ;
as for my people , children are their op@@ pres@@ sors , and women rule over them . O my people , they which lead thee cause thee to er@@ r , and destroy the way of thy paths .
the LORD will enter into judgment with the anci@@ ents of his people , and the princes thereof : for ye have eaten up the viney@@ ard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
and the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Z@@ ion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a fl@@ aming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pipe , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the LORD , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will h@@ iss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
then said I , W@@ oe is me ! for I am un@@ done ; because I am a man of un@@ clean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of un@@ clean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the LORD of hosts .
and it came to pass in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , that Re@@ zin the king of Syria , and Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is con@@ feder@@ ate with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
then said the LORD unto Isaiah , Go forth now to meet A@@ haz , thou , and S@@ hear @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ash@@ u@@ b thy son , at the end of the condu@@ it of the upper pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field ;
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
and on all hills that shall be di@@ gged with the mat@@ to@@ ck , there shall not come thi@@ ther the fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of lesser cattle .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Sam@@ aria shall be taken away before the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and he shall pass through Jud@@ ah ; he shall over@@ flow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Im@@ manuel .
for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Won@@ der@@ ful , Coun@@ seller , The mighty God , The everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
and he shall s@@ nat@@ ch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the des@@ ol@@ ation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the sl@@ ain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
W@@ herefore it shall come to pass , that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Z@@ ion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the st@@ out heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and the glory of his high looks .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts , O my people that dwell@@ est in Z@@ ion , be not afraid of the As@@ sy@@ rian : he shall sm@@ ite thee with a rod , and shall lift up his staff against thee , after the manner of Egypt .
and the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Mi@@ dian at the rock of O@@ re@@ b : and as his rod was upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ ab ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obey them .
and there shall be an highway for the remn@@ ant of his people , which shall be left , from As@@ sy@@ ria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
behold , the day of the LORD com@@ eth , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land des@@ ol@@ ate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
and the people shall take them , and bring them to their place : and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and hand@@ m@@ aids : and they shall take them cap@@ tives , whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bond@@ age where@@ in thou w@@ ast made to serve ,
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming : it stir@@ re@@ th up the dead for thee , even all the chief ones of the earth ; it hath raised up from their thr@@ ones all the kings of the nations .
for thou hast said in th@@ ine heart , I will asc@@ end into heaven , I will ex@@ alt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north :
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an ab@@ om@@ in@@ able branch , and as the ra@@ iment of those that are sl@@ ain , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stones of the pit ; as a car@@ case tro@@ dden under feet .
prepare slaughter for his children for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
rejoice not thou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the rod of him that smo@@ te thee is broken : for out of the ser@@ pent 's root shall come forth a cock@@ at@@ rice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying ser@@ pent .
and the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor shall feed , and the ne@@ edy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall sl@@ ay thy remn@@ ant .
the burden of Mo@@ ab . because in the night A@@ r of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night K@@ ir of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ ab ; he is very proud : even of his ha@@ u@@ ght@@ iness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Mo@@ ab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
but now the LORD hath spoken , saying , Within three years , as the years of an hi@@ rel@@ ing , and the glory of Mo@@ ab shall be contem@@ ned , with all that great multitude ; and the remn@@ ant shall be very small and fee@@ ble .
the fortress also shall cease from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remn@@ ant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and it shall be as when the har@@ vest@@ man gather@@ eth the corn , and re@@ ap@@ eth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gather@@ eth ears in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebu@@ ke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be ch@@ ased as the cha@@ ff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whir@@ l@@ wind .
and behold at even@@ ing@@ tide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lif@@ t@@ eth up an en@@ sign on the mountains ; and when he blow@@ eth a trum@@ pet , hear ye .
the burden of Egypt . behold , the LORD ri@@ det@@ h upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , sa@@ ith the Lord , the LORD of hosts .
surely the princes of Zo@@ an are fo@@ ols , the counsel of the wise counsel@@ lers of Phar@@ aoh is become bru@@ tish : how say ye unto Phar@@ aoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
and the LORD shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w unto the LORD , and perform it .
therefore are my lo@@ ins filled with pain : p@@ ang@@ s have taken hold upon me , as the p@@ ang@@ s of a woman that tr@@ avail@@ eth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the seeing of it .
and , behold , here com@@ eth a ch@@ ari@@ ot of men , with a couple of hor@@ sem@@ en . and he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the gra@@ ven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast he@@ wed thee out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re here , as he that he@@ w@@ eth him out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on high , and that grav@@ eth an hab@@ itation for himself in a rock ?
and I will clo@@ the him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy gir@@ dle , and I will commit thy government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Jud@@ ah .
in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , shall the nail that is fast@@ ened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the LORD hath spoken it .
behold the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; this people was not , till the As@@ sy@@ rian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof ; and he brought it to ruin .
the earth shall re@@ el to and fro like a drun@@ k@@ ard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the trans@@ g@@ ression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
for thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the ne@@ edy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall .
and in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the le@@ es , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the le@@ es well refined .
and it shall be said in that day , L@@ o , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the LORD ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swim@@ met@@ h spread@@ eth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spo@@ ils of their hands .
let favour be sh@@ ew@@ ed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of upri@@ ghtness will he deal un@@ justly , and will not behold the maj@@ esty of the LORD .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a temp@@ est of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters over@@ flowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
and your covenant with death shall be dis@@ ann@@ ul@@ led , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the over@@ flowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be tro@@ dden down by it .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the LORD shall rise up as in mount Per@@ az@@ im , he shall be w@@ ro@@ th as in the valley of Gi@@ be@@ on , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
and thou shalt be brought down , and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be , as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whis@@ per out of the dust .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as cha@@ ff that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marv@@ ell@@ ous work among this people , even a marv@@ ell@@ ous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sancti@@ fy my name , and sancti@@ fy the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
ye shall def@@ ile also the covering of thy gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of thy mol@@ ten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstr@@ uous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sev@@ en@@ fold , as the light of seven days , in the day that the LORD b@@ ind@@ eth up the breach of his people , and heal@@ eth the stroke of their wound .
and his breath , as an over@@ flowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of van@@ ity : and there shall be a bri@@ dle in the j@@ aws of the people , causing them to er@@ r .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the LORD shall lay upon him , it shall be with tab@@ rets and har@@ ps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
for T@@ oph@@ et is ordained of old ; ye@@ a , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of bri@@ m@@ stone , do@@ th kind@@ le it .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the LORD shall stretch out his hand , both he that help@@ eth shall fall , and he that is hol@@ pen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
because the palaces shall be for@@ s@@ aken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the for@@ ts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a past@@ ure of f@@ locks ;
look upon Z@@ ion , the city of our solem@@ n@@ ities : th@@ ine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet hab@@ itation , a tab@@ ern@@ acle that shall not be taken down ; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed , neither shall any of the cor@@ ds thereof be broken .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hear@@ ken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a re@@ comp@@ ence ; he will come and save you .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ria sent Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jerusalem unto king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with a great army . and he stood by the condu@@ it of the upper pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
then said Eli@@ ak@@ im and She@@ b@@ na and Jo@@ ah unto Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
hear@@ ken not to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for thus sa@@ ith the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fi@@ g tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and Isaiah said unto them , Th@@ us shall ye say unto your master , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , where@@ with the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shoul@@ dest be to lay waste def@@ enced cities into ru@@ inous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as corn b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
and said , Rem@@ ember now , O LORD , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt sore .
behold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which is gone down in the sun dial of A@@ haz , ten degrees backward . so the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no ob@@ lation choos@@ eth a tree that will not rot ; he see@@ ket@@ h unto him a cunning work@@ man to prepare a gra@@ ven image , that shall not be moved .
hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the LORD , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fain@@ t@@ eth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eag@@ les ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to his foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? he gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stub@@ ble to his bow .
fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dis@@ may@@ ed ; for I am thy God : I will strengthen thee ; ye@@ a , I will help thee ; ye@@ a , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ atter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon mor@@ ter , and as the pot@@ ter t@@ read@@ eth clay .
sing unto the LORD a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that is therein ; the is@@ les , and the inhabitants thereof .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ edar do@@ th inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the rob@@ bers ? did not the LORD , he against whom we have sin@@ ned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
the beast of the field shall honour me , the dragons and the ow@@ ls : because I give waters in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wear@@ ied thee with inc@@ ense .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wear@@ ied me with th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ities .
one shall say , I am the LORD 's ; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob ; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD , and surname himself by the name of Israel .
and who , as I , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for me , since I appointed the ancient people ? and the things that are coming , and shall come , let them sh@@ ew unto them .
fear ye not , neither be afraid : have not I told thee from that time , and have declared it ? ye are even my witnesses . is there a God beside me ? ye@@ a , there is no God ; I know not any .
behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the work@@ men , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
sing , O ye heavens ; for the LORD hath done it : shout , ye lower parts of the earth : break forth into singing , ye mountains , O forest , and every tree therein : for the LORD hath re@@ deemed Jacob , and glori@@ fied himself in Israel .
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou may@@ est know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel .
drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; I the LORD have created it .
I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth : I said not unto the seed of Jacob , Se@@ ek ye me in vain : I the LORD speak righteousness , I declare things that are right .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , that dwell@@ est ca@@ relessly , that say@@ est in th@@ ine heart , I am , and none else beside me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children :
I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I sh@@ ew@@ ed it thee : lest thou shoul@@ dest say , M@@ ine idol hath done them , and my gra@@ ven image , and my mol@@ ten image , hath commanded them .
all ye , assemble yourselves , and hear ; which among them hath declared these things ? the LORD hath loved him : he will do his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
go ye forth of Babylon , flee ye from the Chal@@ de@@ ans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , The LORD hath re@@ deemed his servant Jacob .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his qui@@ ver hath he hid me ;
and now , sa@@ ith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant , to bring Jacob again to him , Th@@ ough Israel be not gathered , yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD , and my God shall be my strength .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , In an acceptable time have I heard thee , and in a day of salvation have I helped thee : and I will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the des@@ ol@@ ate her@@ it@@ ages ;
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun sm@@ ite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
but thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Even the cap@@ tives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for I will contend with him that cont@@ en@@ det@@ h with thee , and I will save thy children .
and I will feed them that op@@ press thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drun@@ ken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Re@@ deem@@ er , the mighty One of Jacob .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Where is the bill of your mother 's divor@@ cement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your ini@@ qu@@ ities have ye sold yourselves , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions is your mother put away .
the Lord GO@@ D hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he w@@ ak@@ en@@ eth morning by morning , he w@@ ak@@ en@@ eth mine ear to hear as the learned .
who is among you that fe@@ areth the LORD , that obey@@ eth the voice of his servant , that wal@@ ket@@ h in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the LORD , and stay upon his God .
for the LORD shall comfort Z@@ ion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the LORD ; joy and gl@@ ad@@ ness shall be found therein , thank@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of melody .
awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the LORD ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old . art thou not it that hath cut Ra@@ hab , and wounded the dragon ?
therefore the re@@ deemed of the LORD shall return , and come with singing unto Z@@ ion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gl@@ ad@@ ness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
and I have put my words in thy mouth , and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand , that I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and say unto Z@@ ion , Th@@ ou art my people .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? des@@ ol@@ ation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
thus sa@@ ith thy Lord the LORD , and thy God that ple@@ ad@@ eth the cause of his people , Be@@ hold , I have taken out of th@@ ine hand the cup of trembling , even the d@@ reg@@ s of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
now therefore , what have I here , sa@@ ith the LORD , that my people is taken away for n@@ ought ? they that rule over them make them to how@@ l , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and my name continually every day is bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
he was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the living : for the trans@@ g@@ ression of my people was he stricken .
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou conf@@ ounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the repro@@ ach of thy wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood any more .
for this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be w@@ ro@@ th with thee , nor rebu@@ ke thee .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the LORD that hath mercy on thee .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall cl@@ ap their hands .
neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the LORD , speak , saying , The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the e@@ un@@ uch say , Be@@ hold , I am a dry tree .
even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the sons of the stranger , that join themselves to the LORD , to serve him , and to love the name of the LORD , to be his servants , every one that keep@@ eth the sab@@ bath from poll@@ uting it , and tak@@ eth hold of my covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people .
for thus sa@@ ith the high and lofty One that inhabit@@ eth eternity , whose name is Holy ; I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contr@@ ite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite ones .
then shalt thou call , and the LORD shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , Here I am . if thou take away from the midst of thee the y@@ oke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking van@@ ity ;
lift up th@@ ine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nur@@ sed at thy side .
surely the is@@ les shall wait for me , and the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish first , to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the LORD thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because he hath glori@@ fied thee .
thou shalt also su@@ ck the milk of the Genti@@ les , and shalt su@@ ck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Re@@ deem@@ er , the mighty One of Jacob .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that bur@@ neth .
and the Genti@@ les shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the LORD shall name .
then he remembered the days of old , Moses , and his people , saying , Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock ? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ?
look down from heaven , and behold from the hab@@ itation of thy hol@@ iness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bow@@ els and of thy mer@@ cies toward me ? are they restrained ?
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , O God , beside thee , what he hath prepared for him that wa@@ it@@ eth for him .
that he who bl@@ ess@@ eth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he that swe@@ areth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such things ? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ? or shall a nation be born at once ? for as soon as Z@@ ion tr@@ avail@@ ed , she brought forth her children .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the Genti@@ les like a flowing stream : then shall ye su@@ ck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be d@@ and@@ led upon her knees .
they that sancti@@ fy themselves , and puri@@ fy themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine 's flesh , and the ab@@ om@@ ination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the car@@ cases of the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be qu@@ en@@ ched ; and they shall be an ab@@ hor@@ ring unto all flesh .
it came also in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
for , behold , I have made thee this day a def@@ enced city , and an iron pillar , and br@@ as@@ en walls against the whole land , against the kings of Jud@@ ah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
and now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Si@@ h@@ or ? or what hast thou to do in the way of As@@ sy@@ ria , to drink the waters of the river ?
th@@ ine own w@@ ick@@ edness shall correct thee , and thy back@@ sli@@ dings shall re@@ prove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast for@@ s@@ aken the LORD thy God , and that my fear is not in thee , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts .
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
lift up th@@ ine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been li@@ en with . in the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy wh@@ ore@@ doms and with thy w@@ ick@@ edness .
the LORD said also unto me in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the king , H@@ ast thou seen that which back@@ sliding Israel hath done ? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the har@@ lot .
go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou back@@ sliding Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for I am mer@@ ciful , sa@@ ith the LORD , and I will not keep anger for ever .
but I said , How shall I put thee among the children , and give thee a pleasant land , a goo@@ dly heritage of the hosts of nations ? and I said , Th@@ ou shalt call me , My father ; and shalt not turn away from me .
circum@@ c@@ ise yourselves to the LORD , and take away the fores@@ kins of your heart , ye men of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can qu@@ en@@ ch it , because of the evil of your do@@ ings .
the lion is come up from his th@@ icket , and the destro@@ yer of the Genti@@ les is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land des@@ ol@@ ate ; and thy cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabit@@ ant .
my bow@@ els , my bow@@ els ! I am p@@ ained at my very heart ; my heart mak@@ eth a noise in me ; I C@@ AN@@ NOT hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soul , the sound of the trum@@ pet , the alarm of war .
W@@ herefore a lion out of the forest shall sl@@ ay them , and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them , a le@@ op@@ ard shall watch over their cities : every one that go@@ eth out th@@ ence shall be torn in pieces : because their trans@@ gres@@ sions are many , and their back@@ sli@@ dings are increased .
how shall I pardon thee for this ? thy children have for@@ s@@ aken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adul@@ tery , and assembled themselves by troops in the har@@ lots ' houses .
and they shall eat up th@@ ine harvest , and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat : they shall eat up thy f@@ locks and th@@ ine herds : they shall eat up thy v@@ ines and thy fi@@ g trees : they shall impover@@ ish thy f@@ enced cities , where@@ in thou trust@@ ed@@ st , with the sword .
were they ashamed when they had committed ab@@ om@@ ination ? n@@ ay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they bl@@ ush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall : at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down , sa@@ ith the LORD .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hear@@ k@@ ened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
and they have built the high places of T@@ oph@@ et , which is in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
therefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that it shall no more be called T@@ oph@@ et , nor the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in T@@ oph@@ et , till there be no place .
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whi@@ ther I have driven them , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
therefore will I give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to co@@ vet@@ ousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
were they ashamed when they had committed ab@@ om@@ ination ? n@@ ay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they bl@@ ush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall be cast down , sa@@ ith the LORD .
I will surely consume them , sa@@ ith the LORD : there shall be no grapes on the vine , nor fi@@ gs on the fi@@ g tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them .
but let him that glori@@ eth glory in this , that he understand@@ eth and know@@ eth me , that I am the LORD which exercise lov@@ ing@@ kindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , sa@@ ith the LORD .
Egypt , and Jud@@ ah , and E@@ dom , and the children of Am@@ mon , and Mo@@ ab , and all that are in the utmost corners , that dwell in the wilderness : for all these nations are un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and all the house of Israel are un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in the heart .
who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee do@@ th it ap@@ per@@ tain : for@@ as@@ much as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their king@@ doms , there is none like unto thee .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is spoiled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , from the iron furnace , saying , obey my voice , and do them , according to all which I command you : so shall ye be my people , and I will be your God :
that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day . then answered I , and said , So be it , O LORD .
then the LORD said unto me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Jud@@ ah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , He@@ ar ye the words of this covenant , and do them .
then shall the cities of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer inc@@ ense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Jud@@ ah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up al@@ t@@ ars to that shameful thing , even al@@ t@@ ars to burn inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al .
the LORD called thy name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goo@@ dly fruit : with the noise of a great tum@@ ult he hath kind@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for the LORD of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Jud@@ ah , which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al .
if thou hast run with the foot@@ men , and they have wear@@ ied thee , then how can@@ st thou contend with horses ? and if in the land of peace , where@@ in thou trust@@ ed@@ st , they wear@@ ied thee , then how wil@@ t thou do in the swelling of Jordan ?
they have s@@ own wheat , but shall reap thor@@ ns : they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD .
and it came to pass after many days , that the LORD said unto me , A@@ rise , go to E@@ uph@@ rates , and take the gir@@ dle from th@@ ence , which I commanded thee to hide there .
I have seen th@@ ine adul@@ ter@@ ies , and thy neigh@@ ings , the le@@ w@@ dness of thy wh@@ ore@@ dom , and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations on the hills in the fields . w@@ oe unto thee , O Jerusalem ! wil@@ t thou not be made clean ? when shall it once be ?
O the hope of Israel , the s@@ avi@@ our thereof in time of trouble , why shoul@@ dest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a way@@ far@@ ing man that tur@@ neth aside to tar@@ ry for a night ?
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an ob@@ lation , I will not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very griev@@ ous blow .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
she that hath borne seven langu@@ ish@@ eth : she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day : she hath been ashamed and conf@@ ounded : and the resi@@ due of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , sa@@ ith the LORD .
the LORD said , Ver@@ ily it shall be well with thy remn@@ ant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entre@@ at thee well in the time of evil and in the time of afflic@@ tion .
and I will make thee unto this people a f@@ enced br@@ as@@ en wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , sa@@ ith the LORD .
behold , I will send for many f@@ ish@@ ers , sa@@ ith the LORD , and they shall fish them ; and after will I send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
O LORD , my strength , and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of afflic@@ tion , the Genti@@ les shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Su@@ rely our fathers have inherited lies , van@@ ity , and things where@@ in there is no profit .
therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The LORD .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ t@@ eth on eggs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ t@@ eth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
and say unto them , He@@ ar ye the word of the LORD , ye kings of Jud@@ ah , and all Jud@@ ah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
and it shall come to pass , if ye dilig@@ ently hear@@ ken unto me , sa@@ ith the LORD , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sab@@ bath day , but hal@@ low the sab@@ bath day , to do no work therein ;
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David , riding in ch@@ ari@@ ots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem : and this city shall remain for ever .
but if ye will not hear@@ ken unto me to hal@@ low the sab@@ bath day , and not to bear a burden , even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sab@@ bath day ; then will I kind@@ le a fire in the gates thereof , and it shall dev@@ our the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
because they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have e@@ strang@@ ed this place , and have burned inc@@ ense in it unto other gods , whom neither they nor their fathers have known , nor the kings of Jud@@ ah , and have filled this place with the blood of inno@@ cents ;
and I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with their enemies , and they that seek their lives , shall stra@@ it@@ en them .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it , because they have hardened their nec@@ ks , that they might not hear my words .
but the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persec@@ utors shall stum@@ ble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O LORD of hosts , that tri@@ est the righteous , and se@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
he that ab@@ id@@ eth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence : but he that go@@ eth out , and fall@@ eth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans that be@@ siege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Exec@@ ute ye judgment and righteousness , and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the op@@ pres@@ sor : and do no wrong , do no violence to the stranger , the fa@@ ther@@ less , nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets ; all my bones shake ; I am like a drun@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine hath overcome , because of the LORD , and because of the words of his hol@@ iness .
for the land is full of adul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of sw@@ earing the land mour@@ neth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets ; Be@@ hold , I will feed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is prof@@ an@@ eness gone forth into all the land .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pl@@ uck them up .
from the thir@@ teenth year of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Jud@@ ah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the LORD hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hear@@ k@@ ened .
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your do@@ ings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
and all the ming@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ kel@@ on , and A@@ zz@@ ah , and Ek@@ ron , and the remn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the king@@ doms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sh@@ esh@@ ach shall drink after them .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Dr@@ ink ye , and be drun@@ ken , and sp@@ ue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , Be@@ hold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whir@@ l@@ wind shall be raised up from the co@@ asts of the earth .
how@@ l , ye shep@@ herds , and cry ; and wal@@ low yourselves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your disper@@ sions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Stand in the court of the LORD 's house , and speak unto all the cities of Jud@@ ah , which come to worship in the LORD 's house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
now it came to pass , when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Th@@ ou shalt surely die .
why hast thou prophe@@ si@@ ed in the name of the LORD , saying , This house shall be like Sh@@ il@@ oh , and this city shall be des@@ ol@@ ate without an inhabit@@ ant ? and all the people were gathered against Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of the LORD .
therefore now amend your ways and your do@@ ings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
but know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ asth@@ ite prophe@@ si@@ ed in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and sp@@ ake to all the people of Jud@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Z@@ ion shall be pl@@ owed like a field , and Jerusalem shall become he@@ aps , and the mountains of the house as the high places of a forest .
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Uri@@ jah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ ab , and to the king of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and to the king of Ty@@ rus , and to the king of Z@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ;
why will ye die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence , as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the resi@@ due of the vessels that remain in this city ,
and I will bring again to this place J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Jud@@ ah , with all the cap@@ tives of Jud@@ ah , that went into Babylon , sa@@ ith the LORD : for I will break the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon .
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophe@@ si@@ ed both against many countries , and against great king@@ doms , of war , and of evil , and of pesti@@ l@@ ence .
now these are the words of the letter that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the resi@@ due of the elders which were carried away cap@@ tives , and to the priests , and to the prophets , and to all the people whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon ;
( after that J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the king , and the queen , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the princes of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , and the carp@@ enters , and the s@@ mi@@ ths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
and I will be found of you , sa@@ ith the LORD : and I will turn away your cap@@ tivity , and I will gather you from all the nations , and from all the places whi@@ ther I have driven you , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and I will bring you again into the place wh@@ ence I caused you to be carried away captive .
the LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD , for every man that is mad , and mak@@ eth himself a prophet , that thou shoul@@ dest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , that I will break his y@@ oke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
for I am with thee , sa@@ ith the LORD , to save thee : though I make a full end of all nations whi@@ ther I have scattered thee , yet will I not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether un@@ punished .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Jacob 's tents , and have mercy on his dwell@@ ing@@ places ; and the city shall be buil@@ ded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
and their no@@ bles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
they shall come with we@@ eping , and with suppl@@ ications will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way , where@@ in they shall not stum@@ ble : for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Jud@@ ah and in the cities thereof , when I shall bring again their cap@@ tivity ; The LORD bless thee , O hab@@ itation of justice , and mountain of hol@@ iness .
but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel ; After those days , sa@@ ith the LORD , I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their God , and they shall be my people .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , which gi@@ v@@ eth the sun for a light by day , and the ordin@@ ances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , which divi@@ det@@ h the sea when the waves thereof ro@@ ar ; The LORD of hosts is his name :
and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , in the sight of Han@@ ame@@ el mine uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscri@@ bed the book of the purchase , before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evid@@ ences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an ear@@ then vessel , that they may continue many days .
thou sh@@ ew@@ est lov@@ ing@@ kindness unto thousands , and re@@ compens@@ est the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers into the bos@@ om of their children after them : the Great , the Mi@@ ghty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for th@@ ine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that fight against this city , shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the houses , upon whose roofs they have offered inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods , to provoke me to anger .
for the children of Israel and the children of Jud@@ ah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the LORD .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Jud@@ ah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and now therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning this city , where@@ of ye say , It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence ;
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whi@@ ther I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
they come to fight with the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have sl@@ ain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose w@@ ick@@ edness I have hid my face from this city .
then will I cast away the seed of Jacob , and David my servant , so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will cause their cap@@ tivity to return , and have mercy on them .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and tell him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and th@@ ine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
that every man should let his man@@ servant , and every man his mai@@ d@@ servant , being an Hebrew or an He@@ bre@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to w@@ it , of a Jew his brother .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ men , saying ,
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and I will give the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the cal@@ f in tw@@ ain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
behold , I will command , sa@@ ith the LORD , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Jud@@ ah a des@@ ol@@ ation without an inhabit@@ ant .
but it came to pass , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Jud@@ ah , and against all the nations , from the day I sp@@ ake unto thee , from the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah , even unto this day .
then read Bar@@ uch in the book the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of the LORD , in the chamber of G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the LORD 's house , in the ears of all the people .
so the king sent Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elis@@ h@@ ama the scri@@ be 's chamber . and Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
and it came to pass , that when Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the pen@@ knife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hear@@ th , until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hear@@ th .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Jud@@ ah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
and I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will bring upon them , and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and upon the men of Jud@@ ah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them ; but they hear@@ k@@ ened not .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say to the king of Jud@@ ah , that sent you unto me to inqu@@ ire of me ; Be@@ hold , Phar@@ aoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
and when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was I@@ ri@@ jah , the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah , the son of Han@@ ani@@ ah ; and he took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , saying , Th@@ ou fall@@ est away to the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the LORD ? and Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king commanded that they should commit Jer@@ emi@@ ah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the b@@ akers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . thus Jer@@ emi@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
then took they Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and cast him into the dun@@ geon of Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Ham@@ m@@ elec@@ h , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jer@@ emi@@ ah with cor@@ ds . and in the dun@@ geon there was no water , but mire : so Jer@@ emi@@ ah sunk in the mire .
now when E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian , one of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the dun@@ geon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
so E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took th@@ ence old cast cl@@ outs and old ro@@ tten r@@ ags , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the dun@@ geon to Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD : and the king said unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
so Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sw@@ are secretly unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , As the LORD liv@@ eth , that made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
but if thou wil@@ t not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
but Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , the voice of the LORD , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
even they sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
the word that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from the LORD , after that Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an sw@@ are unto them and to their men , saying , Fe@@ ar not to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Mo@@ ab , and among the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and in E@@ dom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h ; and there they did eat bread together in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trum@@ pet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , where@@ of ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
but Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah sett@@ eth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Babylon .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , that were returned from all nations , whi@@ ther they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Jud@@ ah ;
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Y@@ e have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , and upon all the cities of Jud@@ ah ; and , behold , this day they are a des@@ ol@@ ation , and no man dwell@@ eth therein ,
because of their w@@ ick@@ edness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn inc@@ ense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
and when we burned inc@@ ense to the queen of heaven , and poured out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her , without our men ?
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Jud@@ ah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Jud@@ ah , and all the remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , that are gone into the land of Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or theirs .
the word that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sp@@ ake unto Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
thus shalt thou say unto him , The LORD sa@@ ith thus ; Be@@ hold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pl@@ uck up , even this whole land .
W@@ herefore have I seen them dis@@ may@@ ed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled ap@@ ace , and look not back : for fear was round about , sa@@ ith the LORD .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiop@@ ians and the Liby@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ dians , that handle and bend the bow .
he made many to fall , ye@@ a , one fell upon another : and they said , A@@ rise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our n@@ ativity , from the op@@ pressing sword .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fat@@ ted bul@@ locks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their vis@@ itation .
the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith ; Be@@ hold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Phar@@ aoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Phar@@ aoh , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an over@@ flowing flood , and shall over@@ flow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall how@@ l .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
because of the day that com@@ eth to spoil all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and to cut off from Ty@@ rus and Z@@ id@@ on every hel@@ per that remain@@ eth : for the LORD will spoil the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , the remn@@ ant of the country of Cap@@ h@@ tor .
there shall be no more praise of Mo@@ ab : in H@@ esh@@ bon they have devised evil against it ; come , and let us cut it off from being a nation . also thou shalt be cut down , O mad@@ men ; the sword shall pursue thee .
Mo@@ ab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
thou daughter that d@@ ost inhabit Di@@ bon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spo@@ iler of Mo@@ ab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
O vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h , I will we@@ ep for thee with the we@@ eping of J@@ az@@ er : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of J@@ az@@ er : the spo@@ iler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy v@@ intage .
he that fle@@ eth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that get@@ t@@ eth up out of the pit shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring upon it , even upon Mo@@ ab , the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the LORD .
how@@ l , O H@@ esh@@ bon , for A@@ i is spoiled : cry , ye daughters of Rab@@ ba@@ h , gir@@ d you with s@@ ack@@ cloth ; lam@@ ent , and run to and fro by the h@@ edges ; for their king shall go into cap@@ tivity , and his priests and his princes together .
for I have sworn by myself , sa@@ ith the LORD , that Bo@@ z@@ rah shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation , a repro@@ ach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard a rum@@ our from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the he@@ a@@ then , saying , G@@ ather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bo@@ z@@ rah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of E@@ dom be as the heart of a woman in her p@@ ang@@ s .
for I will cause EL@@ AM to be dis@@ may@@ ed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them :
declare ye among the nations , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , Babylon is taken , B@@ el is conf@@ ounded , Mer@@ od@@ ach is broken in pieces ; her idols are conf@@ ounded , her images are broken in pieces .
cut off the s@@ ower from Babylon , and him that hand@@ let@@ h the sick@@ le in the time of harvest : for fear of the op@@ pressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the LORD , the ini@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Jud@@ ah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
I have laid a sn@@ are for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou w@@ ast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast stri@@ ven against the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their ch@@ ari@@ ots , and upon all the ming@@ led people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
for Israel hath not been for@@ s@@ aken , nor Jud@@ ah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her ini@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the LORD 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : for@@ sake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment re@@ ach@@ eth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shi@@ elds : the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Med@@ es : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the LORD , the vengeance of his temple .
set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watch@@ men , prepare the amb@@ ushes : for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he sp@@ ake against the inhabitants of Babylon .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , sa@@ ith the LORD , which destro@@ y@@ est all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trum@@ pet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the king@@ doms of Ar@@ ar@@ at , Min@@ ni , and Ash@@ ch@@ en@@ az ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ers .
the mighty men of Babylon have for@@ born to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwell@@ ing@@ places ; her bars are broken .
and I will make drunk her princes , and her wise men , her cap@@ tains , and her rulers , and her mighty men : and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pit@@ ched against it , and built for@@ ts against it round about .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , came Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the LORD , the Chal@@ de@@ ans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
and the bas@@ ons , and the fire@@ p@@ ans , and the bow@@ ls , and the cal@@ dr@@ ons , and the cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks , and the spo@@ ons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
and a chap@@ iter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chap@@ iter was five cub@@ its , with network and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates upon the chap@@ it@@ ers round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates were like unto these .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prev@@ ail@@ eth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me des@@ ol@@ ate and faint all the day .
Z@@ ion spread@@ eth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstr@@ uous woman among them .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his foot@@ stool in the day of his anger !
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and sle@@ w all that were pleasant to the eye in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the daughter of Z@@ ion : he poured out his fury like fire .
all th@@ ine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they h@@ iss and gn@@ ash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thy@@ self no rest ; let not the apple of th@@ ine eye cease .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ gins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast sl@@ ain them in the day of th@@ ine anger ; thou hast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
now it came to pass in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river of Che@@ bar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of the LORD came expressly unto E@@ ze@@ ki@@ el the priest , the son of Bu@@ zi , in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans by the river Che@@ bar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
and under the firm@@ ament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and above the firm@@ ament that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a throne , as the appearance of a s@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire stone : and upon the lik@@ eness of the throne was the lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I will make thy tongue cle@@ ave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a repro@@ ver : for they are a rebelli@@ ous house .
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with aston@@ ishment :
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remn@@ ant of thee will I sc@@ atter into all the winds .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comfor@@ ted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Sm@@ ite with th@@ ine hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , Al@@ as for all the evil ab@@ om@@ inations of the house of Israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
he that is far off shall die of the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remain@@ eth and is be@@ sieg@@ ed shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
so will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land des@@ ol@@ ate , ye@@ a , more des@@ ol@@ ate than the wilderness toward Di@@ bl@@ ath , in all their hab@@ itations : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will re@@ comp@@ ense thy ways upon thee , and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will re@@ comp@@ ense thee according to thy ways and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that sm@@ it@@ eth .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
mis@@ chief shall come upon mis@@ chief , and rum@@ our shall be upon rum@@ our ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the anci@@ ents .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Jud@@ ah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord GO@@ D fell there upon me .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up th@@ ine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold nor@@ th@@ ward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
and there stood before them seventy men of the anci@@ ents of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Ja@@ az@@ ani@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , with every man his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and a thick cloud of inc@@ ense went up .
then said he unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen what the anci@@ ents of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , The LORD se@@ eth us not ; the LORD hath for@@ s@@ aken the earth .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cher@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clo@@ thed with linen , which had the writer 's ink@@ horn by his side ;
and it came to pass , while they were sl@@ aying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GO@@ D ! wil@@ t thou destroy all the resi@@ due of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
then said he unto me , The ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel and Jud@@ ah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of per@@ vers@@ eness : for they say , The LORD hath for@@ s@@ aken the earth , and the LORD se@@ eth not .
and one cher@@ u@@ b stretched forth his hand from between the cher@@ ub@@ ims unto the fire that was between the cher@@ ub@@ ims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clo@@ thed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me , and said unto me , Spe@@ ak ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Th@@ us have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Your sl@@ ain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
but as for them whose heart wal@@ ket@@ h after the heart of their det@@ est@@ able things and their ab@@ om@@ inations , I will re@@ comp@@ ense their way upon their own heads , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; that they may declare all their ab@@ om@@ inations among the he@@ a@@ then whi@@ ther they come ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
tell them therefore , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will make this prover@@ b to cease , and they shall no more use it as a prover@@ b in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
for I am the LORD : I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in your days , O rebelli@@ ous house , will I say the word , and will perform it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
say unto them which dau@@ b it with un@@ tempered mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flowing shower ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a prover@@ b , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and of thy garments thou did@@ st take , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st thy high places with divers colours , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot there@@ upon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
behold , therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee , and have diminished th@@ ine ordinary food , and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , which are ashamed of thy le@@ w@@ d way .
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down th@@ ine eminent place , and shall break down thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jew@@ els , and leave thee naked and bare .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy sister So@@ dom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of id@@ l@@ eness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; A great eagle with great wings , long@@ wing@@ ed , full of fe@@ athers , which had divers colours , came unto Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the c@@ edar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a wil@@ low tree .
say now to the rebelli@@ ous house , Know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , Be@@ hold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will ple@@ ad with him there for his t@@ resp@@ ass that he hath t@@ resp@@ assed against me .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it : and it shall bring forth b@@ ough@@ s , and bear fruit , and be a goo@@ dly c@@ edar : and under it shall dwell all f@@ owl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
neither hath oppressed any , hath not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
yet say ye , Why ? do@@ th not the son bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the father ? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
but she was pl@@ ucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and with@@ ered ; the fire consumed them .
son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Are ye come to inqu@@ ire of me ? as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , I will not be inqui@@ red of by you .
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had es@@ pied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Y@@ et in this your fathers have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me , in that they have committed a t@@ resp@@ ass against me .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and here@@ after also , if ye will not hear@@ ken unto me : but poll@@ ute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , O ye house of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and say to the land of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his she@@ ath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
and he hath give it to be furb@@ ished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpen@@ ed , and it is furb@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the s@@ layer .
cry and how@@ l , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terr@@ ors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : sm@@ ite therefore upon thy thi@@ gh .
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Remove the di@@ ad@@ em , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : ex@@ alt him that is low , and ab@@ ase him that is high .
wh@@ iles they see van@@ ity unto thee , wh@@ iles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the nec@@ ks of them that are sl@@ ain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their ini@@ qu@@ ity shall have an end .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and sk@@ il@@ ful to destroy .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become d@@ ross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the d@@ ross of silver .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed upon their heads , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
gir@@ ded with gir@@ dles upon their lo@@ ins , exceeding in dy@@ ed at@@ tire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , after the manner of the Bab@@ yl@@ onians of Chal@@ dea , the land of their n@@ ativity :
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that play@@ eth the har@@ lot : so went they in unto A@@ hol@@ ah and unto A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , the le@@ w@@ d women .
also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that where@@ upon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon E@@ dom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it des@@ ol@@ ate from Tem@@ an ; and they of D@@ ed@@ an shall fall by the sword .
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses : and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the LORD have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and they shall take up a lam@@ entation for thee , and say to thee , How art thou destroyed , that w@@ ast inhabited of seaf@@ aring men , the renowned city , which w@@ ast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , which cause their terror to be on all that ha@@ unt it !
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; When I shall make thee a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
and say unto Ty@@ rus , O thou that art situ@@ ate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many is@@ les , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; O Ty@@ rus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
thou art the ano@@ inted cher@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set thee so : thou w@@ ast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sin@@ ned : therefore I will cast thee as prof@@ ane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cher@@ u@@ b , from the midst of the stones of fire .
th@@ ine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
for I will send into her pesti@@ l@@ ence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and there shall be no more a pr@@ icking bri@@ er unto the house of Israel , nor any griev@@ ing thor@@ n of all that are round about them , that desp@@ ised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord GO@@ D .
but I will put hoo@@ ks in thy j@@ aws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
behold , therefore I am against thee , and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and des@@ ol@@ ate , from the tower of Sy@@ ene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the king@@ doms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , which br@@ ing@@ eth their ini@@ qu@@ ity to rem@@ embrance , when they shall look after them : but they shall know that I am the Lord GO@@ D .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Sy@@ ene shall they fall in it by the sword , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I am against Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
the c@@ ed@@ ars in the garden of God could not hide him : the f@@ ir trees were not like his b@@ ough@@ s , and the ch@@ est@@ nut trees were not like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be sl@@ ain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the midst of the he@@ a@@ then .
ye@@ a , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horri@@ bly afraid for thee , when I shall bran@@ dish my sword before them ; and they shall trem@@ ble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
when I shall make the land of Egypt des@@ ol@@ ate , and the country shall be des@@ tit@@ ute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
this is the lam@@ entation where@@ with they shall lam@@ ent her : the daughters of the nations shall lam@@ ent her : they shall lam@@ ent for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
there is M@@ esh@@ ech , tu@@ bal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sl@@ ain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watch@@ man unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ fth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is sm@@ it@@ ten .
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them in a good past@@ ure , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat past@@ ure shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
and I will fill his mountains with his sl@@ ain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are sl@@ ain with the sword .
as thou did@@ st rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was des@@ ol@@ ate , so will I do unto thee : thou shalt be des@@ ol@@ ate , O mount Se@@ ir , and all I@@ dum@@ ea , even all of it : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the he@@ a@@ then any more , neither shalt thou bear the repro@@ ach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I do not this for your s@@ akes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther ye went .
and I will sancti@@ fy my great name , which was prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , which ye have prof@@ an@@ ed in the midst of them ; and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I am the LORD , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , when I shall be sancti@@ fied in you before their eyes .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; In the day that I shall have cleans@@ ed you from all your ini@@ qu@@ ities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be buil@@ ded .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn fe@@ asts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ locks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever@@ more .
and I will turn thee back , and put hoo@@ ks into thy j@@ aws , and I will bring thee forth , and all th@@ ine army , horses and hor@@ sem@@ en , all of them clo@@ thed with all sorts of arm@@ our , even a great company with buck@@ lers and shi@@ elds , all of them handling s@@ words :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , that my fury shall come up in my face .
and I will ple@@ ad against him with pesti@@ l@@ ence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an over@@ flowing rain , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and bri@@ m@@ stone .
so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not let them poll@@ ute my holy name any more : and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I am the LORD , the Holy One in Israel .
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and twentieth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the four@@ teenth year after that the city was sm@@ it@@ ten , in the self@@ same day the hand of the LORD was upon me , and brought me thi@@ ther .
and he brought me thi@@ ther , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he unto the gate which loo@@ ket@@ h toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one re@@ ed broad .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arch@@ es thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and the arch@@ es thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok among the sons of Lev@@ i , which come near to the LORD to minister unto him .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cub@@ its broad on the one side , and six cub@@ its broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the breadth of the door was ten cub@@ its ; and the sides of the door were five cub@@ its on the one side , and five cub@@ its on the other side : and he measured the length thereof , forty cub@@ its : and the breadth , twenty cub@@ its .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cher@@ ub@@ ims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick plan@@ ks upon the face of the por@@ ch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick plan@@ ks .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth sh@@ ined with his glory .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou clean@@ se and purge it .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
then said the LORD unto me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the LORD , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD : and I fell upon my face .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house , and minist@@ ering to the house : they shall sl@@ ay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the ob@@ lation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more op@@ press my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of an Hom@@ er : the measure thereof shall be after the Hom@@ er .
and one lamb out of the flock , out of two hundred , out of the fat past@@ ures of Israel ; for a meat offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make reconciliation for them , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides w@@ est@@ ward .
and the east side ye shall measure from H@@ aur@@ an , and from Damascus , and from Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
and the five thousand , that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a prof@@ ane place for the city , for dwelling , and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst thereof .
moreover from the possession of the Lev@@ ites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Jud@@ ah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates nor@@ th@@ ward ; one gate of Re@@ ub@@ en , one gate of Jud@@ ah , one gate of Lev@@ i .
but Daniel pur@@ posed in his heart that he would not def@@ ile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s that he might not def@@ ile himself .
the king answered and said to the Chal@@ de@@ ans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dun@@ gh@@ ill .
I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king 's matter .
as for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass here@@ after : and he that reve@@ al@@ eth secrets mak@@ eth known to thee what shall come to pass .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the cap@@ tains , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the counsel@@ lers , the sh@@ eri@@ ffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king had set up .
thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cor@@ net , fl@@ ute , har@@ p , s@@ ack@@ but , p@@ sal@@ tery , and dul@@ ci@@ mer , and all kinds of mus@@ ick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king was aston@@ ied , and rose up in ha@@ ste , and sp@@ ake , and said unto his counsel@@ lers , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
he answered and said , L@@ o , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar , wh@@ iles he t@@ asted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king , and his princes , his wives , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , might drink therein .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , drank in them .
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thy@@ self , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
and when he came to the den , he cried with a lam@@ ent@@ able voice unto Daniel : and the king sp@@ ake and said to Daniel , O Daniel , servant of the living God , is thy God , whom thou serv@@ est continually , able to deliver thee from the lions ?
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
and behold another beast , a second , like to a bear , and it raised up itself on one side , and it had three ri@@ bs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it : and they said thus unto it , A@@ rise , dev@@ our much flesh .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands minist@@ ered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
and there was given him dom@@ inion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dom@@ inion is an everlasting dom@@ inion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and his nails of brass ; which dev@@ oured , brake in pieces , and stamped the resi@@ due with his feet ;
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all king@@ doms , and shall dev@@ our the whole earth , and shall t@@ read it down , and break it in pieces .
and he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Sh@@ ush@@ an in the palace , which is in the province of EL@@ AM ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magni@@ fy himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
ye@@ a , all Israel have trans@@ g@@ ressed thy law , even by departing , that they might not obey thy voice ; therefore the curse is poured upon us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God , because we have sin@@ ned against him .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he sp@@ ake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renow@@ n , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ick@@ edly .
in the third year of Cy@@ rus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel , whose name was called Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and the thing was true , but the time appointed was long : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
but his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come , and over@@ flow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stirred up , even to his fortress .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the rob@@ bers of thy people shall ex@@ alt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ ab , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
the word of the LORD that came unto Hos@@ ea , the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , kings of Jud@@ ah , and in the days of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
the beginning of the word of the LORD by Hos@@ ea . and the LORD said to Hos@@ ea , Go , take unto thee a wife of wh@@ ore@@ doms and children of wh@@ ore@@ doms : for the land hath committed great wh@@ ore@@ dom , departing from the LORD .
and the LORD said unto him , Call his name J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ enge the blood of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el upon the house of Je@@ hu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel .
and she conceived again , and bare a daughter . and God said unto him , Call her name L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ ru@@ ham@@ ah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
for their mother hath played the har@@ lot : she that conceived them hath done sham@@ efully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my fla@@ x , mine oil and my drink .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ ali@@ m , where@@ in she burned inc@@ ense to them , and she dec@@ ked herself with her ear@@ rings and her jew@@ els , and she went after her lovers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and I will give her her vineyards from th@@ ence , and the valley of Ach@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
and I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Th@@ ou art my people ; and they shall say , Th@@ ou art my God .
and I said unto her , Th@@ ou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the har@@ lot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn inc@@ ense upon the hills , under o@@ aks and po@@ pl@@ ars and el@@ ms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and your spouses shall commit adul@@ tery .
hear ye this , O priests ; and hear@@ ken , ye house of Israel ; and give ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a sn@@ are on M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , and a net spread upon Tab@@ or .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven ; I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their congregation hath heard .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
the days of vis@@ itation are come , the days of re@@ comp@@ ence are come ; Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the great hatred .
the high places also of A@@ ven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thor@@ n and the th@@ ist@@ le shall come up on their al@@ t@@ ars ; and they shall say to the mountains , C@@ over us ; and to the hills , Fall on us .
and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is as an hei@@ fer that is taught , and lov@@ eth to t@@ read out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to ride ; Jud@@ ah shall plo@@ w , and Jacob shall break his clo@@ ds .
though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
sancti@@ fy ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God , and cry unto the LORD ,
blow ye the trum@@ pet in Z@@ ion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land trem@@ ble : for the day of the LORD com@@ eth , for it is ni@@ gh at hand ;
and the LORD shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that execut@@ eth his word : for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gr@@ acious and mer@@ ciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repent@@ eth him of the evil .
gather the people , sancti@@ fy the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that su@@ ck the breasts : let the bri@@ deg@@ room go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
ye@@ a , the LORD will answer and say unto his people , Be@@ hold , I will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied there@@ with : and I will no more make you a repro@@ ach among the he@@ a@@ then :
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ oso@@ ever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered : for in mount Z@@ ion and in Jerusalem shall be deliver@@ ance , as the LORD hath said , and in the remn@@ ant whom the LORD shall call .
ye@@ a , and what have ye to do with me , O Ty@@ re , and Z@@ id@@ on , and all the co@@ asts of Palestine ? will ye render me a re@@ comp@@ ence ? and if ye re@@ comp@@ ence me , swiftly and spe@@ ed@@ ily will I return your re@@ comp@@ ence upon your own head ;
the LORD also shall ro@@ ar out of Z@@ ion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the LORD will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
and he said , The LORD will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the hab@@ itations of the shep@@ herds shall mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ me@@ l shall wi@@ ther .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole cap@@ tivity , to deliver them up to E@@ dom :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ty@@ rus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole cap@@ tivity to E@@ dom , and remembered not the bro@@ ther@@ ly covenant :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Mo@@ ab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of E@@ dom into lime :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
publish in the palaces at Ash@@ do@@ d , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Sam@@ aria , and behold the great tum@@ ults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
for , lo , he that form@@ eth the mountains , and cre@@ at@@ eth the wind , and decla@@ re@@ th unto man what is his thought , that mak@@ eth the morning darkness , and t@@ read@@ eth upon the high places of the earth , The LORD , The God of hosts , is his name .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
and the LORD said unto me , A@@ mos , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , A plum@@ bl@@ ine . then said the Lord , Be@@ hold , I will set a plum@@ bl@@ ine in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more :
and he said , A@@ mos , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , A basket of summer fruit . then said the LORD unto me , The end is come upon my people of Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
and the songs of the temple shall be how@@ lings in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD :
they that swear by the sin of Sam@@ aria , and say , Th@@ y god , O Dan , liv@@ eth ; and , The manner of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba liv@@ eth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ me@@ l , I will search and take them out th@@ ence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , th@@ ence will I command the ser@@ pent , and he shall bite them :
and the Lord GO@@ D of hosts is he that touch@@ eth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mour@@ n : and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is si@@ fted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
the vision of Ob@@ adi@@ ah . thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D concerning E@@ dom ; We have heard a rum@@ our from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent among the he@@ a@@ then , A@@ rise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle .
thou shoul@@ dest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; ye@@ a , thou shoul@@ dest not have looked on their afflic@@ tion in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the he@@ a@@ then drink continually , ye@@ a , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
but Jon@@ ah rose up to flee unto Tar@@ sh@@ ish from the presence of the LORD , and went down to J@@ op@@ pa ; and he found a ship going to Tar@@ sh@@ ish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tar@@ sh@@ ish from the presence of the LORD .
then the mar@@ in@@ ers were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wa@@ res that were in the ship into the sea , to ligh@@ ten it of them . but Jon@@ ah was gone down into the sides of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep .
and they said every one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jon@@ ah .
then said they unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ; What is th@@ ine occupation ? and wh@@ ence com@@ est thou ? what is thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
and the LORD God prepared a gour@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the gour@@ d .
and it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that God prepared a ve@@ h@@ ement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jon@@ ah , that he fain@@ ted , and wished in himself to die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
for the trans@@ g@@ ression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the trans@@ g@@ ression of Jacob ? is it not Sam@@ aria ? and what are the high places of Jud@@ ah ? are they not Jerusalem ?
pass ye away , thou inhabit@@ ant of S@@ aph@@ ir , having thy shame naked : the inhabit@@ ant of Za@@ an@@ an came not forth in the mourning of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ el ; he shall receive of you his standing .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and fl@@ ay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry unto the LORD , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ rian shall come into our land : and when he shall t@@ read in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shep@@ herds , and eight principal men .
and the remn@@ ant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a de@@ w from the LORD , as the showers upon the grass , that tar@@ ri@@ eth not for man , nor wa@@ it@@ eth for the sons of men .
for the statutes of Om@@ ri are kept , and all the works of the house of A@@ hab , and ye walk in their coun@@ sels ; that I should make thee a des@@ ol@@ ation , and the inhabitants thereof an his@@ sing : therefore ye shall bear the repro@@ ach of my people .
the good man is perished out of the earth : and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , Where is the LORD thy God ? mine eyes shall behold her : now shall she be tro@@ dden down as the mire of the streets .
feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of th@@ ine heritage , which dwell sol@@ it@@ arily in the wood , in the midst of Car@@ me@@ l : let them feed in Bash@@ an and Gil@@ e@@ ad , as in the days of old .
who is a God like unto thee , that par@@ don@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity , and pass@@ eth by the trans@@ g@@ ression of the remn@@ ant of his heritage ? he ret@@ ain@@ eth not his anger for ever , because he deli@@ ght@@ eth in mercy .
God is jeal@@ ous , and the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth ; the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserv@@ eth wrath for his enemies .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierc@@ eness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will aff@@ l@@ ict thee no more .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feed@@ ing@@ place of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whel@@ p , and none made them afraid ?
yet was she carried away , she went into cap@@ tivity : her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her hon@@ our@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
there shall the fire dev@@ our thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the can@@ ker@@ worm : make thy@@ self many as the can@@ ker@@ worm , make thy@@ self many as the lo@@ cu@@ sts .
and they shall sco@@ ff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scor@@ n unto them : they shall der@@ ide every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remn@@ ant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
thou art filled with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy fores@@ kin be uncovered : the cup of the LORD 's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spe@@ wing shall be on thy glory .
O LORD , I have heard thy speech , and was afraid : O LORD , revive thy work in the midst of the years , in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy .
although the fi@@ g tree shall not blos@@ som , neither shall fruit be in the v@@ ines ; the labour of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the st@@ alls :
the word of the LORD which came unto Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of C@@ ush@@ i , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of A@@ mari@@ ah , the son of Hiz@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Jud@@ ah .
and it shall come to pass at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their le@@ es : that say in their heart , The LORD will not do good , neither will he do evil .
the great day of the LORD is near , it is near , and ha@@ st@@ eth greatly , even the voice of the day of the LORD : the mighty man shall cry there bit@@ terly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of w@@ ast@@ eness and des@@ ol@@ ation , a day of darkness and glo@@ om@@ iness , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD 's wrath ; but the whole land shall be dev@@ oured by the fire of his jealousy : for he shall make even a speedy rid@@ dance of all them that dwell in the land .
seek ye the LORD , all ye me@@ ek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek me@@ ek@@ ness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD 's anger .
and the coast shall be for the remn@@ ant of the house of Jud@@ ah ; they shall feed there@@ upon : in the houses of Ash@@ kel@@ on shall they lie down in the evening : for the LORD their God shall visit them , and turn away their cap@@ tivity .
the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
at that time will I bring you again , even in the time that I gather you : for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when I turn back your cap@@ tivity before your eyes , sa@@ ith the LORD .
in the second year of D@@ arius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the LORD by H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet unto Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , governor of Jud@@ ah , and to Joshua the son of Jos@@ ed@@ ech , the high priest , saying ,
since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the press@@ fat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , will I take thee , O Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , my servant , the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , sa@@ ith the LORD , and will make thee as a sig@@ net : for I have chosen thee , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Se@@ bat , in the second year of D@@ arius , came the word of the LORD unto Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Id@@ do the prophet , saying ,
I saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the my@@ r@@ tle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , spec@@ k@@ led , and white .
then the angel of the LORD answered and said , O LORD of hosts , how long wil@@ t thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Jud@@ ah , against which thou hast had indignation these thre@@ es@@ core and ten years ?
and many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
and he answered and sp@@ ake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the fil@@ thy garments from him . and unto him he said , Be@@ hold , I have caused th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity to pass from thee , and I will clo@@ the thee with change of ra@@ iment .
and I said , Let them set a fair mit@@ re upon his head . so they set a fair mit@@ re upon his head , and clo@@ thed him with garments . and the angel of the LORD stood by .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; If thou wil@@ t walk in my ways , and if thou wil@@ t keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my courts , and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by .
then he answered and sp@@ ake unto me , saying , This is the word of the LORD unto Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the hands of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you .
I will bring it forth , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and it shall enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of him that swe@@ areth fal@@ sely by my name : and it shall remain in the midst of his house , and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stor@@ k : and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h between the earth and the heaven .
even he shall build the temple of the LORD ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD , and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you . and this shall come to pass , if ye will dilig@@ ently obey the voice of the LORD your God .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; I am returned unto Z@@ ion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain .
and it shall come to pass , that as ye were a curse among the he@@ a@@ then , O house of Jud@@ ah , and house of Israel ; so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let your hands be strong .
the burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and Damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of Israel , shall be toward the LORD .
Ash@@ kel@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ row@@ ful , and Ek@@ ron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ash@@ kel@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and I will enc@@ amp about mine house because of the army , because of him that pass@@ eth by , and because of him that re@@ tur@@ neth : and no op@@ pres@@ sor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
rejoice greatly , O daughter of Z@@ ion ; shout , O daughter of Jerusalem : behold , thy King com@@ eth unto thee : he is just , and having salvation ; low@@ ly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a col@@ t the fo@@ al of an ass .
and the LORD shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the LORD GO@@ D shall blow the trum@@ pet , and shall go with whir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
the LORD of hosts shall defend them ; and they shall dev@@ our , and sub@@ due with s@@ ling stones ; and they shall drink , and make a noise as through wine ; and they shall be filled like bow@@ ls , and as the corners of the altar .
for the idols have spoken van@@ ity , and the div@@ in@@ ers have seen a lie , and have told false dreams ; they comfort in vain : therefore they went their way as a flock , they were troubled , because there was no shepherd .
and they shall be as mighty men , which t@@ read down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the LORD is with them , and the riders on horses shall be conf@@ ounded .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad and Lab@@ an@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
whose poss@@ essors sl@@ ay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , Bless@@ ed be the LORD ; for I am rich : and their own shep@@ herds pity them not .
and I will feed the flock of slaughter , even you , O poor of the flock . and I took unto me two st@@ aves ; the one I called Beauty , and the other I called B@@ ands ; and I fed the flock .
and the LORD said unto me , C@@ ast it unto the pot@@ ter : a goo@@ dly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the pot@@ ter in the house of the LORD .
in that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that is fee@@ ble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the angel of the LORD before them .
awake , O sword , against my shepherd , and against the man that is my fellow , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts : sm@@ ite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered : and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones .
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses ri@@ fled , and the women ra@@ vis@@ hed ; and half of the city shall go forth into cap@@ tivity , and the resi@@ due of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mu@@ le , of the cam@@ el , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
and it shall be , that wh@@ os@@ o will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the LORD of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
ye@@ a , every pot in Jerusalem and in Jud@@ ah shall be hol@@ iness unto the LORD of hosts : and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them , and see@@ the therein : and in that day there shall be no more the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite in the house of the LORD of hosts .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stum@@ ble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Lev@@ i , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the LORD will cut off the man that do@@ eth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tab@@ ern@@ acles of Jacob , and him that off@@ er@@ eth an offering unto the LORD of hosts .
for the LORD , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith that he hat@@ eth putting away : for one cover@@ eth violence with his garment , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts : therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treach@@ er@@ ously .
behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to this temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and he shall sit as a refin@@ er and puri@@ fer of silver : and he shall puri@@ fy the sons of Lev@@ i , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness .
then they that feared the LORD sp@@ ake often one to another : and the LORD hear@@ k@@ ened , and heard it , and a book of rem@@ embrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD , and that thought upon his name .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and wor@@ shipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frank@@ inc@@ ense , and my@@ rr@@ h .
and was there until the death of Her@@ od : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
saying , A@@ rise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
but when he saw many of the Pharis@@ ees and Sad@@ duc@@ ees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vi@@ pers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and now also the ax@@ e is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his sav@@ our , where@@ with shall it be sal@@ ted ? it is th@@ ence@@ forth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be tro@@ dden under foot of men .
wh@@ oso@@ ever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but wh@@ oso@@ ever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which desp@@ it@@ efully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
therefore when thou do@@ est th@@ ine al@@ ms , do not sound a trum@@ pet before thee , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es do in the syn@@ agogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
and when thou pra@@ y@@ est , thou shalt not be as the hypo@@ crit@@ es are : for they love to pray standing in the syn@@ agogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . is not the life more than meat , and the body than ra@@ iment ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
when Jesus heard it , he marv@@ elled , and said to them that followed , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebu@@ ked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Ger@@ g@@ es@@ en@@ es , there met him two possessed with dev@@ ils , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the pal@@ sy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the pal@@ sy ; Son , be of good che@@ er ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then sa@@ ith he to the sick of the pal@@ sy , ) A@@ rise , take up thy bed , and go unto th@@ ine house .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bri@@ dec@@ ham@@ ber mour@@ n , as long as the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ? but the days will come , when the bri@@ deg@@ room shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
but Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Dau@@ ghter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against un@@ clean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
and thou , Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in So@@ dom , it would have remained until this day .
all things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man know@@ eth the Son , but the Father ; neither know@@ eth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to wh@@ om@@ soever the Son will reveal him .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever spe@@ ak@@ eth a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but wh@@ oso@@ ever spe@@ ak@@ eth against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
the men of N@@ inev@@ eh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they rep@@ ented at the preaching of Jon@@ as ; and , behold , a greater than Jon@@ as is here .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
he also that received seed among the thor@@ ns is he that he@@ areth the word ; and the care of this world , and the dece@@ it@@ fulness of riches , cho@@ ke the word , and he becom@@ eth un@@ fruitful .
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becom@@ eth a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
and when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves vic@@ tu@@ als .
a wicked and adul@@ ter@@ ous generation see@@ ket@@ h after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jon@@ as . and he left them , and departed .
from that time forth began Jesus to sh@@ ew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wil@@ t , let us make here three tab@@ ern@@ acles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Eli@@ as .
and I say unto you , Wh@@ oso@@ ever shall put away his wife , except it be for for@@ n@@ ication , and shall marry another , commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery : and wh@@ os@@ o marri@@ eth her which is put away do@@ th commit adul@@ tery .

Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great f@@ ishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Juda@@ ea , and in Sam@@ aria , and unto the utter@@ most part of the earth .
and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where ab@@ ode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ om@@ ew , and Matthew , James the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus , and Simon Zel@@ otes , and Jud@@ as the brother of James .
beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , sa@@ ith God , I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall proph@@ esy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
and when Peter saw it , he answered unto the people , Y@@ e men of Israel , why mar@@ vel ye at this ? or why look ye so ear@@ ne@@ stly on us , as though by our own power or hol@@ iness we had made this man to walk ?
the God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glori@@ fied his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pil@@ ate , when he was determined to let him go .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Naz@@ areth , whom ye cruci@@ fied , whom God raised from the dead , even by him do@@ th this man stand here before you whole .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glori@@ fied God for that which was done .
for of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast ano@@ inted , both Her@@ od , and Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate , with the Genti@@ les , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were poss@@ essors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
then fell she down strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
saying , Did not we stra@@ itly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man 's blood upon us .
after this man rose up Jud@@ as of Gal@@ ilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
and the next day he sh@@ ew@@ ed himself unto them as they stro@@ ve , and would have set them at one again , saying , S@@ irs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
but he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
and Saul was con@@ sent@@ ing unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Juda@@ ea and Sam@@ aria , except the apostles .
and he arose and went : and , behold , a man of Ethiopia , an e@@ un@@ uch of great authority under C@@ and@@ ace queen of the Ethiop@@ ians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem for to worship ,
and there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named An@@ ani@@ as ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , An@@ ani@@ as . and he said , Be@@ hold , I am here , Lord .
and the Lord said unto him , A@@ rise , and go into the street which is called Str@@ ai@@ ght , and inqu@@ ire in the house of Jud@@ as for one called Saul , of Tar@@ sus : for , behold , he pra@@ y@@ eth ,
but the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Genti@@ les , and kings , and the children of Israel :
and An@@ ani@@ as went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou cam@@ est , hath sent me , that thou mi@@ gh@@ test receive thy sight , and be filled with the Holy Ghost .
but Bar@@ nab@@ as took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
and when he had ap@@ preh@@ ended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four qu@@ ater@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; inten@@ ding after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
and , behold , the angel of the Lord came upon him , and a light sh@@ ined in the prison : and he smo@@ te Peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , A@@ rise up quickly . and his chains fell off from his hands .
and the angel said unto him , G@@ ird thy@@ self , and bind on thy sand@@ als . and so he did . and he sa@@ ith unto him , C@@ ast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
but he , bec@@ k@@ oning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said , Go sh@@ ew these things unto James , and to the brethren . and he departed , and went into another place .
now there were in the church that was at Anti@@ o@@ ch certain prophets and teachers ; as Bar@@ nab@@ as , and Sim@@ eon that was called Niger , and Luci@@ us of Cy@@ rene , and Man@@ a@@ en , which had been brought up with Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch , and Saul .
and now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
then Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as wa@@ xed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves un@@ worthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Genti@@ les .
and when there had been much disput@@ ing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Genti@@ les by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
that the resi@@ due of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Genti@@ les , upon whom my name is called , sa@@ ith the Lord , who do@@ eth all these things .
and a certain woman named Ly@@ dia , a seller of purple , of the city of T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , which wor@@ shipped God , heard us : whose heart the Lord opened , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul .
and this did she many days . but Paul , being griev@@ ed , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and the keeper of the prison aw@@ aking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had been fled .
but Paul said unto them , They have beaten us openly un@@ condemned , being Romans , and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out priv@@ ily ? n@@ ay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out .
and Paul after this tar@@ ried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and s@@ ailed th@@ ence into Syria , and with him P@@ ris@@ c@@ illa and Aqu@@ ila ; having shor@@ n his head in Cen@@ ch@@ rea : for he had a vo@@ w .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being ferv@@ ent in the spirit , he sp@@ ake and taught dilig@@ ently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
then certain of the vag@@ ab@@ ond Jews , Ex@@ or@@ cists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , We ad@@ j@@ ure you by Jesus whom Paul pre@@ ach@@ eth .
and there sat in a window a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third lo@@ ft , and was taken up dead .
for Paul had determined to sail by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he ha@@ sted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentec@@ ost .
but none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
as touching the Genti@@ les which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strang@@ led , and from for@@ n@@ ication .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and bec@@ k@@ oned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he sp@@ ake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
as also the high priest do@@ th bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem , for to be punished .
and when the blood of thy marty@@ r Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and con@@ sent@@ ing unto his death , and kept the ra@@ iment of them that sle@@ w him .
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and b@@ ade that he should be examined by scour@@ ging ; that he might know where@@ fore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with th@@ ongs , Paul said unto the cent@@ ur@@ ion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and un@@ condemned ?
then strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
on the mor@@ row , because he would have known the certainty where@@ fore he was accused of the Jews , he loos@@ ed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought Paul down , and set him before them .
then said Paul , I w@@ ist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
and there arose a great cry : and the scri@@ bes that were of the Pharis@@ ees ' part arose , and stro@@ ve , saying , We find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against God .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have sl@@ ain Paul .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
and he called unto him two cent@@ ur@@ ions , saying , Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caes@@ area , and hor@@ sem@@ en thre@@ es@@ core and ten , and spear@@ men two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ k@@ oned unto him to speak , answered , for@@ as@@ much as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheer@@ fully answer for myself :
and F@@ est@@ us said , King A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
and when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persec@@ ut@@ est thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pr@@ icks .
but rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
to open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sancti@@ fied by faith that is in me .
but sh@@ ew@@ ed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the co@@ asts of Juda@@ ea , and then to the Genti@@ les , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
but the cent@@ ur@@ ion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
and the barbar@@ ous people sh@@ ew@@ ed us no little kindness : for they kind@@ led a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
and from th@@ ence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Ap@@ pi@@ i@@ forum , and The three ta@@ vern@@ s : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
for the heart of this people is wa@@ xed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is un@@ seem@@ ly , and receiving in themselves that re@@ comp@@ ence of their error which was meet .
and the father of circum@@ cision to them who are not of the circum@@ cision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised .
but not as the offence , so also is the free gift . for if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath ab@@ ounded unto many .
for if by one man 's offence death re@@ igned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to w@@ it , the redemption of our body .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . wil@@ t thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing un@@ clean of itself : but to him that este@@ em@@ eth any thing to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Genti@@ les , minist@@ ering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Genti@@ les might be acceptable , being sancti@@ fied by the Holy Ghost .
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Genti@@ les have been made part@@ akers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in car@@ nal things .
unto the church of God which is at Cor@@ inth , to them that are sancti@@ fied in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both theirs and ours :
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the coun@@ sels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
for who mak@@ eth thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou did@@ st not receive ? now if thou did@@ st receive it , why d@@ ost thou glory , as if thou had@@ st not received it ?
for this cause have I sent unto you Timo@@ the@@ us , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , who shall bring you into rem@@ embrance of my ways which be in Christ , as I teach every where in every church .
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sancti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liv@@ eth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
but to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my gl@@ or@@ ying void .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
after the same manner also he took the cup , when he had sup@@ ped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in rem@@ embrance of me .
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also sa@@ ith the law .
but by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I lab@@ oured more ab@@ und@@ antly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
I bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Step@@ han@@ as , that it is the fir@@ st@@ fruits of Ac@@ ha@@ ia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
for our rejo@@ icing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and go@@ dly sincerity , not with fl@@ esh@@ ly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more ab@@ und@@ antly to you @@@ -@@ @ ward .
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
for@@ as@@ much as ye are manifest@@ ly declared to be the epist@@ le of Christ minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fl@@ esh@@ y tables of the heart .
but if the ministr@@ ation of death , written and engra@@ ven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his coun@@ tenance ; which glory was to be done away :
but have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of dis@@ honesty , not walking in craft@@ iness , nor handling the word of God dece@@ it@@ fully ; but by manifestation of the truth comm@@ ending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world hath blin@@ ded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
for though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epist@@ le hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
but I bes@@ e@@ ech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , where@@ with I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I C@@ AN@@ NOT tell ; or whether out of the body , I C@@ AN@@ NOT tell : God know@@ eth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
for though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I for@@ bear , lest any man should think of me above that which he se@@ eth me to be , or that he he@@ areth of me .
I told you before , and fore@@ tell you , as if I were present , the second time ; and being absent now I write to them which her@@ et@@ o@@ fore have sin@@ ned , and to all other , that , if I come again , I will not spare :
and when James , C@@ ep@@ has , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Bar@@ nab@@ as the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the he@@ a@@ then , and they unto the circum@@ cision .
I am cruci@@ fied with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liv@@ eth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cur@@ sed is every one that continu@@ eth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
and this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , C@@ AN@@ NOT dis@@ ann@@ ul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lu@@ sts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
from whom the whole body fit@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint suppl@@ i@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body unto the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; in@@ as@@ much as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are part@@ akers of my grace .
only let your conversation be as it becom@@ eth the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
I know both how to be ab@@ ased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
but I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Ep@@ aph@@ ro@@ dit@@ us the things which were sent from you , an od@@ our of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , well@@ pleasing to God .
for by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thr@@ ones , or dom@@ ini@@ ons , or princip@@ alities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; where@@ of I Paul am made a minister ;
let no man be@@ gu@@ ile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and wor@@ shipping of angels , intru@@ ding into those things which he hath not seen , v@@ ain@@ ly pu@@ ffed up by his fl@@ esh@@ ly mind ,
but even after that we had suffered before , and were sham@@ efully entre@@ ated , as ye know , at Philipp@@ i , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
W@@ herefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of per@@ dition ;
knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the law@@ less and dis@@ obedient , for the un@@ go@@ dly and for sinners , for un@@ holy and prof@@ ane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for man@@ s@@ layers ,
but if I tar@@ ry long , that thou may@@ est know how thou ough@@ test to behave thy@@ self in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
h@@ ence@@ forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
for unto which of the angels said he at any time , Th@@ ou art my Son , this day have I be@@ gotten thee ? and again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
thou hast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the or@@ acles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
for the law mak@@ eth men high priests which have in@@ firm@@ ity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , mak@@ eth the Son , who is consec@@ rated for ever@@ more .
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admon@@ ished of God when he was about to make the tab@@ ern@@ acle : for , See , sa@@ ith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern sh@@ ew@@ ed to thee in the mount .
for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the trans@@ gres@@ sions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
for when Moses had spoken every prec@@ ept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of cal@@ ves and of goats , with water , and scar@@ let wool , and h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and sprink@@ led both the book , and all the people ,
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that com@@ eth to God must believe that he is , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of them that dilig@@ ently seek him .
by faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of Bar@@ ak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ eph@@ th@@ ae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whi@@ ther@@ soever the governor list@@ eth .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of ini@@ qu@@ ity : so is the tongue among our members , that it de@@ fil@@ eth the whole body , and sett@@ eth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that spe@@ ak@@ eth evil of his brother , and jud@@ get@@ h his brother , spe@@ ak@@ eth evil of the law , and jud@@ get@@ h the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the hus@@ band@@ man wa@@ it@@ eth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very p@@ iti@@ ful , and of tender mercy .
Eli@@ as was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed ear@@ ne@@ stly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
elect according to the fore@@ knowledge of God the Father , through sanc@@ tification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprink@@ ling of the blood of Jesus Christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath be@@ gotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
for@@ as@@ much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
if ye be repro@@ ached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God rest@@ eth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glori@@ fied .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who priv@@ ily shall bring in dam@@ n@@ able here@@ sies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of un@@ clean@@ ness , and desp@@ ise government . presu@@ mp@@ tuous are they , self@@ w@@ illed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dig@@ n@@ ities .
and shall receive the reward of un@@ righteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and bl@@ em@@ ishes , sporting themselves with their own decei@@ vings while they feast with you ;
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again ent@@ angled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
( for the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and sh@@ ew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God ab@@ id@@ eth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
for there are certain men cre@@ pt in un@@ awa@@ res , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , un@@ go@@ dly men , turning the grace of our God into l@@ as@@ ci@@ vi@@ ousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spir@@ its which are before his throne ;
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribu@@ lation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the is@@ le that is called Pat@@ mos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
but I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Bal@@ a@@ am , who taught Bal@@ ac to cast a stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ block before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit for@@ n@@ ication .
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which search@@ eth the re@@ ins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
but unto you I say , and unto the rest in T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
and unto the angel of the church in Sar@@ dis write ; These things sa@@ ith he that hath the seven Spir@@ its of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou liv@@ est , and art dead .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou may@@ est be rich ; and white ra@@ iment , that thou may@@ est be clo@@ thed , and that the shame of thy n@@ ak@@ edness do not appear ; and ano@@ int th@@ ine eyes with ey@@ es@@ al@@ ve , that thou may@@ est see .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lam@@ b , having every one of them har@@ ps , and golden vi@@ als full of od@@ ours , which are the prayers of saints .
and they sung a new song , saying , Th@@ ou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou w@@ ast sl@@ ain , and hast re@@ deemed us to God by thy blood out of every kind@@ red , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were sl@@ ain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and I saw another angel asc@@ ending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
and the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was sm@@ it@@ ten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was dark@@ ened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tor@@ m@@ ented five months : and their tor@@ ment was as the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ pi@@ on , when he stri@@ ket@@ h a man .
and sw@@ are by him that liv@@ eth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Gi@@ ve me the little book . and he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were sl@@ ain of men seven thousand : and the remn@@ ant were aff@@ righ@@ ted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The king@@ doms of this world are become the king@@ doms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and w@@ ast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast re@@ igned .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were light@@ nings , and voices , and thunder@@ ings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to dev@@ our her child as soon as it was born .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old ser@@ pent , called the Devil , and Satan , which decei@@ v@@ eth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the acc@@ user of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . w@@ oe to the inhabit@@ ers of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he know@@ eth that he hath but a short time .
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were re@@ deemed from the earth .
saying with a loud voice , Fe@@ ar God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the foun@@ tains of waters .
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thr@@ ust in thy sick@@ le , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lam@@ b , saying , Great and marv@@ ell@@ ous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven pl@@ agues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a nois@@ ome and griev@@ ous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which wor@@ shipped his image .
for they are the spirits of dev@@ ils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in rem@@ embrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierc@@ eness of his wrath .
and the angel said unto me , W@@ herefore did@@ st thou mar@@ vel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carri@@ eth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
and they cast dust on their heads , and cried , we@@ eping and w@@ ailing , saying , Al@@ as , alas , that great city , where@@ in were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her co@@ st@@ liness ! for in one hour is she made des@@ ol@@ ate .
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Th@@ us with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the f@@ ow@@ ls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the sup@@ per of the great God ;
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
but the fearful , and un@@ believing , and the ab@@ om@@ in@@ able , and murderers , and wh@@ ore@@ mon@@ gers , and sorcer@@ ers , and id@@ ol@@ aters , and all li@@ ars , shall have their part in the lake which bur@@ neth with fire and bri@@ m@@ stone : which is the second death .
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that de@@ fil@@ eth , neither whatsoever work@@ eth ab@@ om@@ ination , or mak@@ eth a lie : but they which are written in the Lam@@ b 's book of life .
in the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
