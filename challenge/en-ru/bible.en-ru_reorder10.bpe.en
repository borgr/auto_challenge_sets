and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebelli@@ ous , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glut@@ ton , and a drun@@ k@@ ard . "
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
you shall not bring the hire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
when you shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
the secret things belong to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse : therefore choose life , that you may live , you and your seed ;
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrong@@ ly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not done all this . ' "
and she said to the men , " I know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trum@@ pets of r@@ ams ' horns before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h advanced , and blew the trum@@ pets ; and the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h followed them .
he brought near the family of Jud@@ ah ; and he selected the family of the Zer@@ ah@@ ites . he brought near the family of the Zer@@ ah@@ ites man by man , and Zab@@ di was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , was selected .
the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
they also resorted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ keys , and win@@ es@@ kins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gil@@ gal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a covenant with us . "
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded .
and ruled in Mount Her@@ mon , and in Sal@@ ec@@ ah , and in all Bash@@ an , to the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites , and half Gil@@ e@@ ad , the border of Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah according to their families was to the border of E@@ dom , even to the wilderness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward , at the utter@@ most part of the south .
and it went out sou@@ th@@ ward of the ascent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and went up by the south of Kad@@ esh Bar@@ ne@@ a , and passed along by Hez@@ ron , went up to Ad@@ dar , and turned about to Kar@@ ka ;
the east border was the Salt Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ eph@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ est@@ ward to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount j@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
she said , " Gi@@ ve me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah the border went along w@@ est@@ ward to the bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families ;
they did@@ n '@@ t drive out the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in Ge@@ zer ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites dwell in the midst of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , " Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance , since I am a great people , because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed me so far ? "
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Jud@@ ah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north , and went up through the hill country w@@ est@@ ward . it ended at the wilderness of B@@ eth A@@ ven .
they set apart K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee in the hill country of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , Sh@@ ec@@ hem in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) in the hill country of Jud@@ ah .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
" but if you do at all go back , and hold fast to the remn@@ ant of these nations , even these who remain among you , and make marriages with them , and go in to them , and they to you ;
Joshua said to the people , " You can '@@ t serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for he is a holy God . he is a jeal@@ ous God . he will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins .
the wat@@ chers saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him , " Please show us the entrance into the city , and we will deal kindly with you . "
Bar@@ ak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
however S@@ is@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; for there was peace between Jab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
and I said to you , " I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the A@@ mor@@ ites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the oak which was in O@@ ph@@ rah , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ rite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ ep@@ ress , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Mill@@ o , and went and made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
they troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year . for eighteen years , they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which is in Gil@@ e@@ ad .
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah sent messengers to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
then the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over Gil@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
he struck them from A@@ ro@@ er until you come to Min@@ n@@ ith , even twenty cities , and to A@@ bel@@ cher@@ am@@ im , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Am@@ mon were subdued before the children of Israel .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and be@@ w@@ ail my vir@@ g@@ inity , I and my companions . "
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ah of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
she fast@@ ened it with the pin , and said to him , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are on you , Sam@@ son ! " he awakened out of his sleep , and pl@@ ucked away the pin of the beam , and the web .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Ben@@ jam@@ ites .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this w@@ ick@@ edness happen ? "
all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and set themselves in array at Ba@@ al Tam@@ ar : and the amb@@ ush@@ ers of Israel broke forth out of their place , even out of Ma@@ are@@ h Ge@@ ba .
the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most val@@ i@@ ant , and commanded them , saying , " Go and strike the inhabitants of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad with the edge of the sword , with the women and the little ones .
they took them wives of the women of Mo@@ ab ; the name of the one was Or@@ pa@@ h , and the name of the other Ru@@ th : and they lived there about ten years .
so Na@@ omi returned , and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Mo@@ ab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
she said , ' Please let me g@@ lean and gather after the re@@ apers among the she@@ aves . ' so she came , and has continued even from the morning until now , except that she stayed a little in the house . "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Na@@ omi " ; and they named him O@@ bed . he is the father of Jes@@ se , the father of David .
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a for@@ k of three teeth in his hand ;
the man of yours , whom I shall not cut off from my altar , shall consume your eyes , and gri@@ eve your heart ; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don '@@ t cease to cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , " Where did you go ? " he said , " To seek the don@@ keys . when we saw that they were not found , we came to Samuel . "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but rebel against the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , then will the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be against you , as it was against your fathers .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a str@@ ait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in rocks , and in cover@@ ts , and in pits .
therefore I said , ' Now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down on me to Gil@@ gal , and I haven '@@ t entre@@ ated the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
and A@@ hij@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , I@@ ch@@ ab@@ od 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of El@@ i , the priest of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Sh@@ il@@ oh , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . the people did@@ n '@@ t know that Jonathan was gone .
there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the gar@@ rison , and the spo@@ il@@ ers , they also trem@@ bled ; and the earth qu@@ aked : so there was an exceeding great trembling .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor be@@ arer were not there .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ ish@@ ua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ ab , and the name of the younger Mic@@ h@@ al :
Samuel said to Saul , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent me to ano@@ int you to be king over his people , over Israel . now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Saul said , " They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have gone the way which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent me , and have brought Ag@@ ag the king of A@@ mal@@ ek , and have utterly destroyed the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
so David prevailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
Saul was very angry , and this saying dis@@ pleased him ; and he said , " They have ascri@@ bed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascri@@ bed but thousands . what can he have more but the kingdom ? "
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was dis@@ cont@@ ented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Ben@@ jam@@ ites ! will the son of Jes@@ se give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " Be@@ hold , your hand@@ maid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
moreover Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
David sent messengers to I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth , Saul 's son , saying , " Deli@@ ver me my wife Mic@@ h@@ al , whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the ears of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
they set the ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab that was in the hill : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hio , the sons of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , drove the new cart .
they brought in the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
David said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " It was before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits ini@@ qu@@ ity , I will cha@@ sten him with the rod of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men ;
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ ab returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jerusalem .
I , where would I carry my shame ? and as for you , you will be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , please speak to the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from you . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were vir@@ gins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sl@@ ain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
to change the face of the matter has your servant Jo@@ ab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
so Jo@@ ab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kis@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
the king said to Z@@ ad@@ ok , " Car@@ ry back the ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his hab@@ itation ;
then the king said to Zi@@ ba , " Be@@ hold , all that per@@ tains to M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth is yours . " Zi@@ ba said , " I do obe@@ is@@ ance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
Hus@@ hai said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " No ; but wh@@ om@@ ever Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
the king commanded Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai and It@@ tai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the cap@@ tains concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then A@@ him@@ a@@ az ran by the way of the Pl@@ ain , and outr@@ an the C@@ ush@@ ite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watch@@ man said , " I think the running of the first one is like the running of A@@ him@@ a@@ az the son of Z@@ ad@@ ok . " the king said , " He is a good man , and comes with good news . "
he bowed the heart of all the men of Jud@@ ah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
a ferry boat went to bring over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . Shim@@ ei the son of Ger@@ a fell down before the king , when he had come over the Jordan .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why did@@ n '@@ t you go with me , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ? "
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us , and we will hang them up to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Saul , the chosen of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " the king said , " I will give them . "
after him was Sham@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of l@@ enti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was enc@@ amped in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ara@@ un@@ ah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the thresh@@ ing instruments and the y@@ okes of the ox@@ en for the wood :
his father had not dis@@ pleased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
so Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mu@@ le , and brought him to Gi@@ hon .
five cub@@ its was the one wing of the cher@@ u@@ b , and five cub@@ its the other wing of the cher@@ u@@ b : from the utter@@ most part of the one wing to the utter@@ most part of the other were ten cub@@ its .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of c@@ edar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the por@@ ch of the house .
there were nets of chec@@ ker work , and wre@@ aths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the por@@ ch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
Hir@@ am made the basins , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the basins . so Hir@@ am made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h :
there I have set a place for the ark , in which is the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
as for all the people who were left of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bond@@ servants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots and of his hor@@ sem@@ en .
she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones . there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
the man J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am was a mighty man of val@@ or ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industri@@ ous , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cl@@ ad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the y@@ oke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
for it was said to me by the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
for the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger .
for all the sins of Ba@@ asha , and the sins of E@@ lah his son , which they sin@@ ned , and with which they made Israel to sin , to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger with their van@@ ities .
Elijah said to the prophets of Ba@@ al , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
it was so , when mid@@ day was past , that they prophe@@ si@@ ed until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
then the fire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the t@@ rench .
he said to his servant , " Go up now , look toward the sea . " he went up , and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " he said , " Go again " seven times .
but the rest fled to Ap@@ he@@ k , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand men who were left . Ben had@@ ad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
A@@ hab said to Elijah , " Have you found me , my enemy ? " he answered , " I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I come in peace . " ' "
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elis@@ ha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
now Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ ab was a sheep bre@@ eder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and of one hundred thousand r@@ ams .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
when they came down to him , Elis@@ ha prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elis@@ ha .
while he was still talking with them , behold , the messenger came down to him . then he said , " Be@@ hold , this evil is from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . why should I wait for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h any longer ? "
they rose up in the tw@@ ilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
the people went out , and pl@@ under@@ ed the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a she@@ kel , and two measures of barley for a she@@ kel , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I con@@ spi@@ red against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Su@@ r ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .

then Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent messengers to Je@@ ho@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
this was the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to Je@@ hu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .

it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,

now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
where are the gods of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ pad ? where are the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim , of Hen@@ a , and Iv@@ v@@ ah ? have they delivered Sam@@ aria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "

it happened in the eighteenth year of king Jo@@ si@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the scri@@ be , to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " Hil@@ ki@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
" thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Jud@@ ah has read .
surely there was not kept such a Pas@@ sover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Jud@@ ah ;
notwithstanding , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t turn from the fierc@@ eness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kind@@ led against Jud@@ ah , because of all the provocation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .
all the men of might , even seven thousand , and the craftsmen and the s@@ mi@@ ths one thousand , all of them strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .

so Saul died for his t@@ resp@@ ass which he committed against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because of the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he did@@ n '@@ t keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inqu@@ ire ,

David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ! " all the assembly blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and pro@@ str@@ ated themselves before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the king .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .

and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
then Solomon began to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at Jerusalem on Mount M@@ ori@@ ah , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the thresh@@ ing floor of Or@@ nan the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cub@@ its , joining to the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b .
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I coven@@ anted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
and there were six steps to the throne , with a foot@@ stool of gold , which were fast@@ ened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
then As@@ a brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben had@@ ad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Jud@@ ah , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him mighty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Zi@@ z . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jer@@ u@@ el .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ ab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Se@@ ir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , everyone helped to destroy another .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ hab ; for he had the daughter of A@@ hab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah consulted his advisers , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for our fathers have t@@ resp@@ assed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ s@@ aken him , and have turned away their faces from the hab@@ itation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
my sons , don '@@ t be neg@@ lig@@ ent now ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn inc@@ ense . "
moreover He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king and the princes commanded the Lev@@ ites to sing pra@@ ises to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of As@@ ap@@ h the se@@ er . they sang pra@@ ises with gl@@ ad@@ ness , and they bowed their heads and worshi@@ ped .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sancti@@ fied themselves : therefore the Lev@@ ites were in charge of killing the Pas@@ so@@ vers for everyone who was not clean , to sancti@@ fy them to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
all the assembly of Jud@@ ah , with the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Jud@@ ah , rejo@@ iced .
do@@ es@@ n '@@ t He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ? '

Don '@@ t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ ghten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
thus Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saved He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and did@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they ro@@ asted the Pas@@ sover with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was prepared the same day , to keep the Pas@@ sover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to the commandment of king Jo@@ si@@ ah .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which is in Jerusalem .
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
then when the copy of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and their companions , they went in ha@@ ste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the rest of the children of the cap@@ tivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Lev@@ ites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes the king .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Lev@@ ites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
then were assembled to me everyone who trem@@ bled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their t@@ resp@@ ass of the cap@@ tivity ; and I sat conf@@ ounded until the evening offering .
when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it griev@@ ed them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
I said to the no@@ bles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can '@@ t come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
" remember , my God , Tob@@ i@@ ah and San@@ ball@@ at according to these their works , and also the proph@@ et@@ ess No@@ adi@@ ah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear . "
of the priests : the children of Hob@@ aiah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the daughters of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite , and was called after their name .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand dar@@ ics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the great God . all the people answered , " A@@ men , A@@ men , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshi@@ ped Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with their faces to the ground .
moreover you gave them king@@ doms and peoples , which you allo@@ tted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Si@@ hon , even the land of the king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an .
" nevertheless they were dis@@ obedient , and reb@@ elled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies .
these were in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jes@@ hua , the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and in the days of Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah the governor , and of E@@ z@@ ra the priest the scri@@ be .
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ ab@@ ite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ esh , who were door@@ keepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Es@@ ther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
the king said to Es@@ ther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
Ham@@ an recoun@@ ted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
the king said , " What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mor@@ dec@@ ai for this ? " then the king 's servants who attended him said , " No@@ thing has been done for him . "
he said , " N@@ aked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has taken away . blessed be the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "

then Jer@@ emi@@ ah called Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah ; and Bar@@ uch wrote from the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .

and I will fetch a mor@@ sel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .
and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Per@@ adventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and he looked toward So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , and toward all the land of the plain , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent L@@ ot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which L@@ ot d@@ wel@@ t .
but God came to Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h in a dream by night , and said to him , Be@@ hold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
and it came to pass , as the cam@@ els had done drinking , that the man took a golden ear@@ ring of half a she@@ kel weight , and two brac@@ elets for her hands of ten she@@ k@@ els weight of gold ;
and the man came into the house : and he un@@ gir@@ ded his cam@@ els , and gave straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for the cam@@ els , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him f@@ locks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and men@@ servants , and mai@@ d@@ servants , and cam@@ els , and asses .
and she made ha@@ ste , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er from her shoulder , and said , Dr@@ ink , and I will give thy cam@@ els drink also : so I drank , and she made the cam@@ els drink also .
and the servant brought forth jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and ra@@ iment , and gave them to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they blessed Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , and said unto her , Th@@ ou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that wal@@ ket@@ h in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a V@@ ail , and covered herself .
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ne@@ ba@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ edar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ s@@ am ,
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah his wife .
that thou wil@@ t do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had di@@ gged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , B@@ less me , even me also , O my father .
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dom@@ inion , that thou shalt break his y@@ oke from off thy neck .
and thi@@ ther were all the f@@ locks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and Re@@ ub@@ en went in the days of wheat harvest , and found man@@ dr@@ akes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Le@@ ah . then Rach@@ el said to Le@@ ah , Gi@@ ve me , I pray thee , of thy son 's man@@ dr@@ akes .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Es@@ au : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t drove and drove .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thi@@ gh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thi@@ gh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and these are the sons of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah Es@@ au 's wife ; du@@ ke Je@@ ush , du@@ ke Ja@@ al@@ am , du@@ ke Kor@@ ah : these were the du@@ kes that came of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Be@@ hold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obe@@ is@@ ance to me .
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites merchan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ elites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and it came to pass , when she tr@@ avail@@ ed , that the one put out his hand : and the mid@@ wife took and bound upon his hand a scar@@ let thread , saying , This came out first ,
and it came to pass , as she sp@@ ake to Joseph day by day , that he hear@@ k@@ ened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kind@@ led .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and sh@@ ew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Phar@@ aoh , and bring me out of this house :
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ dles of money , they were afraid .
behold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hath made me a father to Phar@@ aoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were thre@@ es@@ core and ten .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fain@@ ted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Phar@@ aoh 's house .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Phar@@ aoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and they made their lives bitter with hard bond@@ age , in mor@@ ter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , where@@ in they made them serve , was with ri@@ g@@ our .
now when Phar@@ aoh heard this thing , he sought to sl@@ ay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Phar@@ aoh , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Th@@ us shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
and the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who mak@@ eth the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ?
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in th@@ ine own people .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , S@@ ay unto Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and Phar@@ aoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : int@@ re@@ at for me .
and Phar@@ aoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israel@@ ites dead . and the heart of Phar@@ aoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with bl@@ ains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the lo@@ cu@@ sts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very griev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such lo@@ cu@@ sts as they , neither after them shall be such .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will har@@ den the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Phar@@ aoh , and upon all his host , upon his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ sem@@ en .
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he he@@ areth your mur@@ mur@@ ings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye mur@@ mur against us ?
W@@ herefore the people did chi@@ de with Moses , and said , Gi@@ ve us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chi@@ de ye with me ? W@@ herefore do ye temp@@ t the LORD ?
and the people thir@@ sted there for water ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses , and said , W@@ herefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
and Je@@ thr@@ o said , Bless@@ ed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Phar@@ aoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
and the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
if she please not her master , who hath bet@@ ro@@ thed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt dece@@ it@@ fully with her .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circum@@ spect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nad@@ ab , and A@@ bi@@ hu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye af@@ ar off .
and Moses wrote all the words of the LORD , and rose up early in the morning , and buil@@ ded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the LORD hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the cand@@ les@@ tick out of the one side , and three branches of the cand@@ les@@ tick out of the other side :
and they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
and the curious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breast@@ plate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d inward .
and Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breast@@ plate of judgment upon his heart , when he go@@ eth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the LORD continually .
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates of blue , and of purple , and of scar@@ let , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour ming@@ led with the fourth part of an H@@ in of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an H@@ in of wine for a drink offering .
this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before the LORD : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
when they go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , they shall wash with water , that they die not ; or when they come near to the altar to minister , to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD :
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
for Moses had said , consec@@ rate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may best@@ ow upon you a blessing this day .
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the LORD talked with Moses .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Hit@@ tite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
and Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . so the people were restrained from bringing .
and the cher@@ ub@@ ims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy se@@ at@@ ward were the faces of the cher@@ ub@@ ims .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the st@@ aves to bear it with@@ al .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the V@@ ail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD , ye shall bring your offering of the cattle , even of the herd , and of the flock .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the LORD , shall be made with leav@@ en : for ye shall burn no leav@@ en , nor any honey , in any offering of the LORD made by fire .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprink@@ le the blood upon the altar round about .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
even the whole bul@@ lock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
or if his sin , which he hath sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without bl@@ emish , for his sin which he hath sin@@ ned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of sw@@ earing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he w@@ ist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprink@@ led of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that where@@ on it was sprink@@ led in the holy place .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole ob@@ lation for an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD , and it shall be the priest 's that sprink@@ let@@ h the blood of the peace offerings .
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their ob@@ l@@ ations unto the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai .
and Moses took the breast , and wav@@ ed it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consec@@ ration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and Moses dilig@@ ently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Ele@@ az@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying ,
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the ho@@ of : as the cam@@ el , because he chew@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ det@@ h not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean unto you .
even these of them ye may eat ; the loc@@ ust after his kind , and the bal@@ d loc@@ ust after his kind , and the beet@@ le after his kind , and the gras@@ shop@@ per after his kind .
and every thing where@@ upon any part of their car@@ case fall@@ eth shall be un@@ clean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are un@@ clean , and shall be un@@ clean unto you .
for I am the LORD your God : ye shall therefore sancti@@ fy yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye def@@ ile yourselves with any manner of cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth .
who shall offer it before the LORD , and make an at@@ onement for her ; and she shall be cleans@@ ed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean : it is the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy .
but if the sc@@ all be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the sc@@ all is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean .
when ye be come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him before the LORD for his issue .
and he shall put the inc@@ ense upon the fire before the LORD , that the cloud of the inc@@ ense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; for they are her near kin@@ s@@ women : it is w@@ ick@@ edness .
it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the mor@@ row : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor prof@@ ane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the LORD .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they prof@@ ane not my holy name in those things which they hal@@ low unto me : I am the LORD .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwit@@ tingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
blind , or broken , or ma@@ im@@ ed , or having a w@@ en , or s@@ cur@@ vy , or sc@@ ab@@ bed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sab@@ bath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sab@@ bath of the LORD in all your dwell@@ ings .
without the V@@ ail of the testimony , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and Moses sp@@ ake to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cur@@ sed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses .
and if thy brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : ye@@ a , though he be a stranger , or a so@@ jour@@ ner ; that he may live with thee .
and if a so@@ jour@@ ner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwell@@ eth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or so@@ jour@@ ner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be des@@ ol@@ ate .
he shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
but if he sancti@@ fy his field after the jub@@ ile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jub@@ ile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .
so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
but the Lev@@ ites shall pitch round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Lev@@ ites shall keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the en@@ sign of their father 's house : far off about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall they pitch .
all that were numbered in the camp of Jud@@ ah were an hundred thousand and four@@ score thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
then the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Lev@@ ites in the midst of the camp : as they enc@@ amp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the priest .
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an at@@ onement for him , for that he sin@@ ned by the dead , and shall hal@@ low his head that same day .
and he shall consec@@ rate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was de@@ filed .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ ab .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el the son of Z@@ u@@ ar .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Eli@@ ab the son of Hel@@ on .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Eliz@@ ur the son of She@@ de@@ ur .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Shel@@ um@@ iel the son of Zur@@ ish@@ add@@ ai .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Eli@@ as@@ ap@@ h the son of De@@ u@@ el .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Elis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ mi@@ hud .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Gam@@ ali@@ el the son of Ped@@ ah@@ z@@ ur .

and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Pag@@ iel the son of O@@ cr@@ an .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Ah@@ ira the son of En@@ an .
this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was ano@@ inted , by the princes of Israel : twelve char@@ gers of silver , twelve silver bow@@ ls , twelve spo@@ ons of gold :
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Lev@@ ites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Lev@@ ites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and those men said unto him , We are de@@ filed by the dead body of a man : W@@ herefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
and when the cloud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cloud ab@@ ode , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their tents .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
shall the f@@ locks and the herds be sl@@ ain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
the LORD is long@@ suffering , and of great mercy , for@@ giving ini@@ qu@@ ity and trans@@ g@@ ression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on inc@@ ense , and made an at@@ onement for the people .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be th@@ ine ; every one that is clean in th@@ ine house shall eat of it .
but the Lev@@ ites shall do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
thus ye also shall offer an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD of all your ti@@ thes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's he@@ ave offering to Aaron the priest .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall ba@@ the his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be un@@ clean until the even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people ab@@ ode in Kad@@ esh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and said to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
then the LORD opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the princes of Bal@@ ak .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and when he looked on A@@ mal@@ ek , he took up his parable , and said , A@@ mal@@ ek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet sav@@ our unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bul@@ locks , and one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year : they shall be unto you without bl@@ emish :
also in the day of the fir@@ st@@ fruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet sav@@ our ; one young bul@@ lock , one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without bl@@ emish :
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the so@@ jour@@ ner among them : that every one that kill@@ eth any person un@@ awa@@ res may flee thi@@ ther .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the s@@ layer shall return into the land of his possession .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it de@@ fil@@ eth the land : and the land C@@ AN@@ NOT be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother unto his daughters .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God do@@ th give us .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD sp@@ ake unto me : and we comp@@ assed mount Se@@ ir many days .
med@@ dle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Se@@ ir unto Es@@ au for a possession .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the river Ar@@ non , and half mount Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ ad@@ ites .
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou may@@ est go in and possess the good land which the LORD sw@@ are unto thy fathers ,
who fed thee in the wilderness with man@@ na , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ az@@ ar his son minist@@ ered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Lev@@ i , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hear@@ ken dilig@@ ently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall t@@ read upon , as he hath said unto you .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bond@@ age .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Th@@ ou shalt open th@@ ine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy ne@@ edy , in thy land .
thou shalt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy win@@ ep@@ ress : of that where@@ with the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy mai@@ d@@ servant thou shalt do likewise .
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inqui@@ red dilig@@ ently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ om@@ ination is wrought in Israel :
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in th@@ ine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess it .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the A@@ mor@@ ites , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the fir@@ st@@ born , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the fir@@ st@@ born is his .
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebelli@@ ous , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glut@@ ton , and a drun@@ k@@ ard .
but unto the dam@@ sel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun go@@ eth down , that he may sleep in his own ra@@ iment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
and it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born which she be@@ areth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and pl@@ ai@@ ster them with pl@@ ai@@ ster :
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy k@@ ine , and the f@@ locks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store@@ houses , and in all that thou sett@@ est th@@ ine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
thou shalt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a viney@@ ard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your cap@@ tains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Th@@ ou shalt not go over this Jordan .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Lev@@ i , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall dis@@ til as the de@@ w , as the small rain upon the tender her@@ b , and as the showers upon the grass :
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : sm@@ ite through the lo@@ ins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
and he brought the family of Jud@@ ah ; and he took the family of the Zar@@ h@@ ites : and he brought the family of the Zar@@ h@@ ites man by man ; and Zab@@ di was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , was taken .
and the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and ha@@ sted and set the city on fire .
they did work wil@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gil@@ gal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ ad@@ ites , and the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
all the kingdom of O@@ g in Bash@@ an , which re@@ igned in Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and in E@@ dre@@ i , who remained of the remn@@ ant of the giants : for these did Moses sm@@ ite , and cast them out .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the wilderness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the utter@@ most part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the utter@@ most part of Jordan :
and the border comp@@ assed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ est@@ ward unto mount Se@@ ir , and passed along unto the side of mount j@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ il@@ oh , and passed by it on the east to J@@ ano@@ ha@@ h ;
and the children of Joseph sp@@ ake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , for@@ as@@ much as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua sp@@ ake unto the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , Th@@ ou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ mi@@ m , and descended to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
and then the coast tur@@ neth to Ram@@ ah , and to the strong city Ty@@ re ; and the coast tur@@ neth to Hos@@ ah ; and the out@@ go@@ ings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Ach@@ zi@@ b :
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cle@@ ave unto the remn@@ ant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and Joshua said unto the people , Y@@ e C@@ AN@@ NOT serve the LORD : for he is an holy God ; he is a jeal@@ ous God ; he will not forgive your trans@@ gres@@ sions nor your sins .
namely , five lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Sid@@ onians , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in mount Lebanon , from mount Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Her@@ mon unto the entering in of Ham@@ ath .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ eb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Ch@@ ush@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Ch@@ ush@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parl@@ our were locked , they said , Su@@ rely he cover@@ eth his feet in his summer chamber .
and Bar@@ ak said unto her , If thou wil@@ t go with me , then I will go : but if thou wil@@ t not go with me , then I will not go .
How@@ be@@ it S@@ is@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite : for there was peace between Jab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Mach@@ ir came down governors , and out of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah ; even Is@@ sac@@ har , and also Bar@@ ak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Re@@ ub@@ en there were great thoughts of heart .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bond@@ age ;
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
thus was Mi@@ dian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qui@@ et@@ ness forty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem unto his mother 's brethren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren sp@@ ake of him in the ears of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h ; for they said , He is our brother .
and the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , T@@ herefore we turn again to thee now , that thou may@@ est go with us , and fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gil@@ e@@ ad .
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over Gil@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad he passed over unto the children of Am@@ mon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and be@@ w@@ ail my vir@@ g@@ inity , I and my fellows .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Tim@@ nat@@ h of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
and he said , Y@@ e have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What ail@@ eth thee ?
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : How@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses sadd@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hi@@ ther into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gi@@ be@@ ah .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were sm@@ it@@ ten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Ben@@ jam@@ ites , because they trusted unto the li@@ ers in wait which they had set beside Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kis@@ sed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
so Na@@ omi returned , and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Mo@@ ab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and she went , and came , and g@@ leaned in the field after the re@@ apers : and her H@@ AP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Bo@@ az , who was of the kind@@ red of E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h .
and she said , I pray you , let me g@@ lean and gather after the re@@ apers among the she@@ aves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tar@@ ried a little in the house .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in th@@ ine eyes , that thou shoul@@ dest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and when Bo@@ az had eaten and drunk , and his heart was mer@@ ry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man pl@@ ucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the LORD , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and did not eat .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was sm@@ it@@ ten before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and they sle@@ w of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and it came to pass , while the ark ab@@ ode in Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lam@@ ented after the LORD .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hear@@ ken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
and he will appoint him cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over fif@@ ties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of Bec@@ hor@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a mighty man of power .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had sm@@ it@@ ten a gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and that Israel also was had in ab@@ om@@ ination with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gil@@ gal .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the gar@@ rison , and the spo@@ il@@ ers , they also trem@@ bled , and the earth qu@@ aked : so it was a very great trembling .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the ox@@ en , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
so David prevailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
and Saul was very w@@ ro@@ th , and the saying dis@@ pleased him ; and he said , They have ascri@@ bed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascri@@ bed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and Saul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
then A@@ him@@ elec@@ h answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and go@@ eth at thy bidding , and is hon@@ our@@ able in th@@ ine house ?
now therefore know and consider what thou wil@@ t do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Beli@@ al , that a man C@@ AN@@ NOT speak to him .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Be@@ hold , let th@@ ine hand@@ maid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and Ab@@ ig@@ ail ha@@ sted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribu@@ lation .
W@@ herefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fast@@ ed until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad , and said unto them , Bless@@ ed be ye of the LORD , that ye have sh@@ ew@@ ed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : W@@ herefore that place was called Hel@@ k@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and they took up As@@ ah@@ el , and buried him in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Jo@@ ab and his men went all night , and they came to He@@ br@@ on at break of day .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab that was in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hio , the sons of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , dra@@ ve the new cart .
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ it@@ tite .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit ini@@ qu@@ ity , I will cha@@ sten him with the rod of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men :
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
and the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David sle@@ w the men of seven hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of the Syrians , and forty thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and smo@@ te Sho@@ bach the captain of their host , who died there .
and when all the kings that were servants to Had@@ are@@ zer saw that they were sm@@ it@@ ten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Am@@ mon any more .
and David said to Uri@@ ah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uri@@ ah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were vir@@ gins ap@@ pa@@ rel@@ led . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hath sl@@ ain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
for we must needs die , and are as water spil@@ t on the ground , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be gathered up again ; neither do@@ th God respect any person : yet do@@ th he devise means , that his ban@@ ished be not expelled from him .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hi@@ de not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Jo@@ ab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
so Jo@@ ab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kis@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and one told David , saying , A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el is among the conspir@@ ators with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el into fool@@ is@@ hness .
then said the king to Zi@@ ba , Be@@ hold , th@@ ine are all that per@@ tained unto M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . and Zi@@ ba said , I hum@@ bly bes@@ e@@ ech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
then said Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
and Hus@@ hai said unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , N@@ ay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in th@@ ine own person .
and the king commanded Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai and It@@ tai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and all the people heard when the king gave all the cap@@ tains charge concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
then said Jo@@ ab , I may not tar@@ ry thus with thee . and he took three dar@@ ts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Ab@@ sal@@ om , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and Jo@@ ab said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not bear ti@@ dings this day , but thou shalt bear ti@@ dings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no ti@@ dings , because the king 's son is dead .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
for thy servant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , W@@ herefore w@@ ent@@ est not thou with me , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ?
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose . and the king said , I will give them .
and David sp@@ ake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and after him was Sham@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of l@@ enti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
and his father had not dis@@ pleased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goo@@ dly man ; and his mother bare him after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and while he yet sp@@ ake , behold , Jonathan the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest came : and Ad@@ oni@@ jah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a val@@ i@@ ant man , and br@@ ing@@ est good ti@@ dings .
and the king hath sent with him Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mu@@ le :
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not n@@ ay . and the king said unto her , As@@ k on , my mother : for I will not say thee n@@ ay .
and it was told king Solomon that Jo@@ ab was fled unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of Gil@@ e@@ ad , in the country of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , and of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cub@@ its in length , and twenty cub@@ its in breadth , and twenty cub@@ its in the height thereof : and he over@@ laid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of c@@ edar .
and he made a por@@ ch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof thirty cub@@ its : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cub@@ it high : and on the top of the base the le@@ dges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the le@@ dges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he gra@@ ved cher@@ ub@@ ims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and Hir@@ am made the lav@@ ers , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . so Hir@@ am made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD :
and I have set there a place for the ark , where@@ in is the covenant of the LORD , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond@@ men : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and his hor@@ sem@@ en .
and three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD , and he burnt inc@@ ense upon the altar that was before the LORD . so he finished the house .
and when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the host was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and he said to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , Take thee ten pieces : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel , Be@@ hold , I will ren@@ d the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
and also Ma@@ acha@@ h his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a gro@@ ve ; and As@@ a destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and he bought the hill Sam@@ aria of Sh@@ em@@ er for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Sh@@ em@@ er , owner of the hill , Sam@@ aria .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel unto mount Car@@ me@@ l , and the prophets of Ba@@ al four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the gro@@ ves four hundred , which eat at J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel 's table .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Ba@@ al , Choose you one bul@@ lock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the t@@ rench .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ hab heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ hab rose up to go down to the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
and the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets prophe@@ si@@ ed before them .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , Su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out .
and one washed the ch@@ ari@@ ot in the pool of Sam@@ aria ; and the dogs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they washed his arm@@ our ; according unto the word of the LORD which he sp@@ ake .
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah do@@ th rest on Elis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and when all the Mo@@ ab@@ ites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on arm@@ our , and upward , and stood in the border .
and when the king of Mo@@ ab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even unto the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Be@@ hold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
and they rose up in the tw@@ ilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the utter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ hab : for the daughter of A@@ hab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the LORD .
and thou shalt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ hab thy master , that I may av@@ enge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the LORD , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
and he said , Th@@ row her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprink@@ led on the wall , and on the horses : and he tro@@ de her under foot .
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sab@@ bath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
How@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the LORD bow@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , bas@@ ons , trum@@ pets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD :
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might where@@ with he fought against Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
this was the word of the LORD which he sp@@ ake unto Je@@ hu , saying , Th@@ y sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat king : and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am dra@@ ve Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Ab@@ i , the daughter of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ ah .
at that time did He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD , and from the pillars which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
then R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria :
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and they said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebu@@ ke , and bl@@ asph@@ emy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and Isaiah said unto them , Th@@ us shall ye say to your master , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said unto Isaiah , What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day ?
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Babylon .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
go up to Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
and Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest said unto Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hil@@ ki@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Jud@@ ah hath read :
surely there was not Hol@@ den such a pas@@ sover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Jud@@ ah ;
and Phar@@ aoh @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h put him in bands at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river E@@ uph@@ rates all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
and he carried away Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into cap@@ tivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
now the sons of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah , Abraham 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : she bare Zim@@ ran , and Jo@@ k@@ shan , and Med@@ an , and Mi@@ dian , and I@@ sh@@ b@@ ak , and Shu@@ ah . and the sons of Jo@@ k@@ shan ; She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an .
and their brethren of the house of their fathers were , Michael , and M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , and She@@ ba , and Jor@@ ai , and J@@ ach@@ an , and Z@@ ia , and He@@ ber , seven .
and the sons of U@@ lam were mighty men of val@@ our , arch@@ ers , and had many sons , and sons ' sons , an hundred and fifty . all these are of the sons of Benjamin .
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ lag , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and J@@ edi@@ ael , and Michael , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and Eli@@ hu , and Z@@ il@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of the thousands that were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
and of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to He@@ br@@ on , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the Lev@@ ites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of mus@@ ick , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ mb@@ als , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
and I have been with thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou hast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ ab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and David said to Jo@@ ab and to the rulers of the people , Go , number Israel from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sab@@ baths , in the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the LORD :
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD , and the king .
then Solomon sp@@ ake unto all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cub@@ its after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cub@@ its , and the breadth twenty cub@@ its .
and he made the most holy house , the length where@@ of was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof twenty cub@@ its : and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and under it was the simil@@ itude of ox@@ en , which did compass it round about : ten in a cub@@ it , comp@@ assing the sea round about . two rows of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosper@@ ously effected .
and this house , which is high , shall be an aston@@ ishment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , E@@ ase somewhat the y@@ oke that thy father did put upon us ?
and the LORD said , Who shall enti@@ ce A@@ hab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad ? and one sp@@ ake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Ber@@ acha@@ h ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Ber@@ acha@@ h , unto this day .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , Be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada and his sons ano@@ inted him , and said , God save the king .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to w@@ it , with all the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Jud@@ ah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , after the ab@@ om@@ inations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for bond@@ men and bond@@ women unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
for our fathers have t@@ resp@@ assed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have for@@ s@@ aken him , and have turned away their faces from the hab@@ itation of the LORD , and turned their backs .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprink@@ led the blood , which they received of the hand of the Lev@@ ites .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sp@@ ake comfortably unto all the Lev@@ ites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers .
and all the congregation of Jud@@ ah , with the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Jud@@ ah , rejo@@ iced .
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the work@@ men that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Lev@@ ites .
and they ro@@ asted the pas@@ sover with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other holy offerings so@@ d they in pots , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ ed@@ ily among all the people .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
now when the copy of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and their companions , they went up in ha@@ ste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
the copy of the letter that Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and his companions the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ach@@ ites , which were on this side the river , sent unto D@@ arius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , the Chal@@ dean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Lev@@ ites , in my realm , which are minded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of A@@ ha@@ va , that we might aff@@ l@@ ict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and his brethren ; Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and J@@ ari@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it griev@@ ed them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Ped@@ aiah the son of Par@@ osh .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebu@@ ked the no@@ bles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Y@@ e exact us@@ ury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
who came with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , Jes@@ hua , Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah , Az@@ ari@@ ah , Ra@@ am@@ i@@ ah , N@@ ah@@ am@@ ani , Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Bil@@ shan , Mis@@ per@@ eth , B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai , Ne@@ h@@ um , Ba@@ an@@ ah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tir@@ sha@@ tha gave to the treasure a thousand dr@@ ams of gold , fifty bas@@ ons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
moreover thou g@@ av@@ est them king@@ doms and nations , and did@@ st divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Si@@ hon , and the land of the king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an .
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ ab@@ ite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ esh , of those which kept the door , were w@@ ro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and when inqui@@ sition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ icles before the king .
and the king said unto Es@@ ther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
and Ham@@ an told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
and he wrote in the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horse@@ back , and riders on mul@@ es , cam@@ els , and young dro@@ med@@ aries :
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pray unto thee in a time when thou may@@ est be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come ni@@ gh unto him .
by terrible things in righteousness wil@@ t thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
th@@ ine own friend , and thy father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into thy brother 's house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
for there is no rem@@ embrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how Di@@ eth the wise man ? as the fool .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of Shen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
bring no more vain ob@@ l@@ ations ; inc@@ ense is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto me ; the new mo@@ ons and sab@@ baths , the calling of assemblies , I C@@ AN@@ NOT away with ; it is ini@@ qu@@ ity , even the solemn meeting .
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the mol@@ es and to the b@@ ats ;
as for my people , children are their op@@ pres@@ sors , and women rule over them . O my people , they which lead thee cause thee to er@@ r , and destroy the way of thy paths .
the LORD will enter into judgment with the anci@@ ents of his people , and the princes thereof : for ye have eaten up the viney@@ ard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pipe , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the LORD , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will h@@ iss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is con@@ feder@@ ate with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Sam@@ aria shall be taken away before the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and he shall pass through Jud@@ ah ; he shall over@@ flow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Im@@ manuel .
and he shall s@@ nat@@ ch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the des@@ ol@@ ation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the sl@@ ain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ ab ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obey them .
and there shall be an highway for the remn@@ ant of his people , which shall be left , from As@@ sy@@ ria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
behold , the day of the LORD com@@ eth , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land des@@ ol@@ ate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bond@@ age where@@ in thou w@@ ast made to serve ,
prepare slaughter for his children for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
rejoice not thou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the rod of him that smo@@ te thee is broken : for out of the ser@@ pent 's root shall come forth a cock@@ at@@ rice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying ser@@ pent .
and the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor shall feed , and the ne@@ edy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall sl@@ ay thy remn@@ ant .
the burden of Mo@@ ab . because in the night A@@ r of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night K@@ ir of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ ab ; he is very proud : even of his ha@@ u@@ ght@@ iness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
the fortress also shall cease from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remn@@ ant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and it shall be as when the har@@ vest@@ man gather@@ eth the corn , and re@@ ap@@ eth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gather@@ eth ears in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lif@@ t@@ eth up an en@@ sign on the mountains ; and when he blow@@ eth a trum@@ pet , hear ye .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , sa@@ ith the Lord , the LORD of hosts .
surely the princes of Zo@@ an are fo@@ ols , the counsel of the wise counsel@@ lers of Phar@@ aoh is become bru@@ tish : how say ye unto Phar@@ aoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
and the LORD shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w unto the LORD , and perform it .
and in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the le@@ es , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the le@@ es well refined .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a temp@@ est of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters over@@ flowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the LORD shall rise up as in mount Per@@ az@@ im , he shall be w@@ ro@@ th as in the valley of Gi@@ be@@ on , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as cha@@ ff that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sancti@@ fy my name , and sancti@@ fy the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
ye shall def@@ ile also the covering of thy gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of thy mol@@ ten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstr@@ uous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
because the palaces shall be for@@ s@@ aken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the for@@ ts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a past@@ ure of f@@ locks ;
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hear@@ ken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a re@@ comp@@ ence ; he will come and save you .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ria sent Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jerusalem unto king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with a great army . and he stood by the condu@@ it of the upper pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and said , Rem@@ ember now , O LORD , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt sore .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no ob@@ lation choos@@ eth a tree that will not rot ; he see@@ ket@@ h unto him a cunning work@@ man to prepare a gra@@ ven image , that shall not be moved .
thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ atter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon mor@@ ter , and as the pot@@ ter t@@ read@@ eth clay .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ edar do@@ th inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the rob@@ bers ? did not the LORD , he against whom we have sin@@ ned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wear@@ ied thee with inc@@ ense .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wear@@ ied me with th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ities .
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou may@@ est know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel .
drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; I the LORD have created it .
I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth : I said not unto the seed of Jacob , Se@@ ek ye me in vain : I the LORD speak righteousness , I declare things that are right .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
go ye forth of Babylon , flee ye from the Chal@@ de@@ ans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , The LORD hath re@@ deemed his servant Jacob .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his qui@@ ver hath he hid me ;
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun sm@@ ite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
who is among you that fe@@ areth the LORD , that obey@@ eth the voice of his servant , that wal@@ ket@@ h in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the LORD , and stay upon his God .
awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the LORD ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old . art thou not it that hath cut Ra@@ hab , and wounded the dragon ?
therefore the re@@ deemed of the LORD shall return , and come with singing unto Z@@ ion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gl@@ ad@@ ness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? des@@ ol@@ ation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
now therefore , what have I here , sa@@ ith the LORD , that my people is taken away for n@@ ought ? they that rule over them make them to how@@ l , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and my name continually every day is bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the LORD that hath mercy on thee .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall cl@@ ap their hands .
lift up th@@ ine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nur@@ sed at thy side .
thou shalt also su@@ ck the milk of the Genti@@ les , and shalt su@@ ck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Re@@ deem@@ er , the mighty One of Jacob .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that bur@@ neth .
and the Genti@@ les shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the LORD shall name .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , Be@@ hold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
they that sancti@@ fy themselves , and puri@@ fy themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine 's flesh , and the ab@@ om@@ ination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , sa@@ ith the LORD .
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hear@@ k@@ ened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whi@@ ther I have driven them , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not val@@ i@@ ant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee do@@ th it ap@@ per@@ tain : for@@ as@@ much as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their king@@ doms , there is none like unto thee .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is spoiled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
then shall the cities of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer inc@@ ense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Jud@@ ah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up al@@ t@@ ars to that shameful thing , even al@@ t@@ ars to burn inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al .
the LORD called thy name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goo@@ dly fruit : with the noise of a great tum@@ ult he hath kind@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
they have s@@ own wheat , but shall reap thor@@ ns : they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD .
O the hope of Israel , the s@@ avi@@ our thereof in time of trouble , why shoul@@ dest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a way@@ far@@ ing man that tur@@ neth aside to tar@@ ry for a night ?
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
the LORD said , Ver@@ ily it shall be well with thy remn@@ ant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entre@@ at thee well in the time of evil and in the time of afflic@@ tion .
therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The LORD .
as for me , I have not ha@@ st@@ ened from being a pastor to follow thee : neither have I desired the wo@@ eful day ; thou know@@ est : that which came out of my lips was right before thee .
and say unto them , He@@ ar ye the word of the LORD , ye kings of Jud@@ ah , and all Jud@@ ah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
then came Jer@@ emi@@ ah from T@@ oph@@ et , whi@@ ther the LORD had sent him to proph@@ esy ; and he stood in the court of the LORD 's house ; and said to all the people ,
but the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persec@@ utors shall stum@@ ble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O LORD of hosts , that tri@@ est the righteous , and se@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets ; Be@@ hold , I will feed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is prof@@ an@@ eness gone forth into all the land .
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your do@@ ings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
and all the ming@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ kel@@ on , and A@@ zz@@ ah , and Ek@@ ron , and the remn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the king@@ doms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sh@@ esh@@ ach shall drink after them .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , Be@@ hold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whir@@ l@@ wind shall be raised up from the co@@ asts of the earth .
if so be they will hear@@ ken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their do@@ ings .
therefore now amend your ways and your do@@ ings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the resi@@ due of the vessels that remain in this city ,
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophe@@ si@@ ed both against many countries , and against great king@@ doms , of war , and of evil , and of pesti@@ l@@ ence .
( after that J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the king , and the queen , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the princes of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , and the carp@@ enters , and the s@@ mi@@ ths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , that I will break his y@@ oke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
thou sh@@ ew@@ est lov@@ ing@@ kindness unto thousands , and re@@ compens@@ est the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers into the bos@@ om of their children after them : the Great , the Mi@@ ghty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for th@@ ine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
for the children of Israel and the children of Jud@@ ah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and I will give the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the cal@@ f in tw@@ ain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
but Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , the voice of the LORD , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
even they sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trum@@ pet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
but Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah sett@@ eth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Babylon .
because of their w@@ ick@@ edness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn inc@@ ense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
W@@ herefore have I seen them dis@@ may@@ ed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled ap@@ ace , and look not back : for fear was round about , sa@@ ith the LORD .
Egypt ris@@ eth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he sa@@ ith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiop@@ ians and the Liby@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ dians , that handle and bend the bow .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
because of the day that com@@ eth to spoil all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and to cut off from Ty@@ rus and Z@@ id@@ on every hel@@ per that remain@@ eth : for the LORD will spoil the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , the remn@@ ant of the country of Cap@@ h@@ tor .
Mo@@ ab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
thou daughter that d@@ ost inhabit Di@@ bon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spo@@ iler of Mo@@ ab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
for I have sworn by myself , sa@@ ith the LORD , that Bo@@ z@@ rah shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation , a repro@@ ach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard a rum@@ our from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the he@@ a@@ then , saying , G@@ ather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the LORD , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Jud@@ ah together , going and we@@ eping : they shall go , and seek the LORD their God .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
I have laid a sn@@ are for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou w@@ ast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast stri@@ ven against the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
for Israel hath not been for@@ s@@ aken , nor Jud@@ ah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watch@@ men , prepare the amb@@ ushes : for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he sp@@ ake against the inhabitants of Babylon .
the mighty men of Babylon have for@@ born to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwell@@ ing@@ places ; her bars are broken .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prev@@ ail@@ eth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me des@@ ol@@ ate and faint all the day .
Z@@ ion spread@@ eth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstr@@ uous woman among them .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his foot@@ stool in the day of his anger !
the word of the LORD came expressly unto E@@ ze@@ ki@@ el the priest , the son of Bu@@ zi , in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans by the river Che@@ bar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
and I will make thy tongue cle@@ ave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a repro@@ ver : for they are a rebelli@@ ous house .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
he that is far off shall die of the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remain@@ eth and is be@@ sieg@@ ed shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
mis@@ chief shall come upon mis@@ chief , and rum@@ our shall be upon rum@@ our ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the anci@@ ents .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Your sl@@ ain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
but as for them whose heart wal@@ ket@@ h after the heart of their det@@ est@@ able things and their ab@@ om@@ inations , I will re@@ comp@@ ense their way upon their own heads , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
say unto them which dau@@ b it with un@@ tempered mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flowing shower ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a prover@@ b , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and of thy garments thou did@@ st take , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st thy high places with divers colours , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot there@@ upon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy sister So@@ dom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of id@@ l@@ eness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a wil@@ low tree .
neither hath oppressed any , hath not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
but she was pl@@ ucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and with@@ ered ; the fire consumed them .
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Y@@ et in this your fathers have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me , in that they have committed a t@@ resp@@ ass against me .
and he hath give it to be furb@@ ished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpen@@ ed , and it is furb@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the s@@ layer .
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Remove the di@@ ad@@ em , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : ex@@ alt him that is low , and ab@@ ase him that is high .
wh@@ iles they see van@@ ity unto thee , wh@@ iles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the nec@@ ks of them that are sl@@ ain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their ini@@ qu@@ ity shall have an end .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and sk@@ il@@ ful to destroy .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become d@@ ross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the d@@ ross of silver .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed upon their heads , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
thou shalt even drink it and su@@ ck it out , and thou shalt break the sh@@ er@@ ds thereof , and pl@@ uck off th@@ ine own breasts : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; When I shall make thee a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
thou art the ano@@ inted cher@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set thee so : thou w@@ ast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
th@@ ine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
and there shall be no more a pr@@ icking bri@@ er unto the house of Israel , nor any griev@@ ing thor@@ n of all that are round about them , that desp@@ ised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord GO@@ D .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the king@@ doms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
all the f@@ ow@@ ls of heaven made their ne@@ sts in his b@@ ough@@ s , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be sl@@ ain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the midst of the he@@ a@@ then .
when I shall make the land of Egypt des@@ ol@@ ate , and the country shall be des@@ tit@@ ute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
this is the lam@@ entation where@@ with they shall lam@@ ent her : the daughters of the nations shall lam@@ ent her : they shall lam@@ ent for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
there is M@@ esh@@ ech , tu@@ bal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sl@@ ain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watch@@ man unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
I will feed them in a good past@@ ure , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat past@@ ure shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
and I will fill his mountains with his sl@@ ain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are sl@@ ain with the sword .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; In the day that I shall have cleans@@ ed you from all your ini@@ qu@@ ities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be buil@@ ded .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn fe@@ asts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ locks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , that my fury shall come up in my face .
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arch@@ es thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and the arch@@ es thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cher@@ ub@@ ims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick plan@@ ks upon the face of the por@@ ch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick plan@@ ks .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth sh@@ ined with his glory .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD : and I fell upon my face .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of an Hom@@ er : the measure thereof shall be after the Hom@@ er .
and the east side ye shall measure from H@@ aur@@ an , and from Damascus , and from Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates nor@@ th@@ ward ; one gate of Re@@ ub@@ en , one gate of Jud@@ ah , one gate of Lev@@ i .
as for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass here@@ after : and he that reve@@ al@@ eth secrets mak@@ eth known to thee what shall come to pass .
he answered and said , L@@ o , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all king@@ doms , and shall dev@@ our the whole earth , and shall t@@ read it down , and break it in pieces .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the rob@@ bers of thy people shall ex@@ alt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ ab , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ ali@@ m , where@@ in she burned inc@@ ense to them , and she dec@@ ked herself with her ear@@ rings and her jew@@ els , and she went after her lovers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and I said unto her , Th@@ ou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the har@@ lot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn inc@@ ense upon the hills , under o@@ aks and po@@ pl@@ ars and el@@ ms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and your spouses shall commit adul@@ tery .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven ; I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their congregation hath heard .
sancti@@ fy ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God , and cry unto the LORD ,
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gr@@ acious and mer@@ ciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repent@@ eth him of the evil .
and he said , The LORD will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the hab@@ itations of the shep@@ herds shall mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ me@@ l shall wi@@ ther .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole cap@@ tivity , to deliver them up to E@@ dom :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ty@@ rus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole cap@@ tivity to E@@ dom , and remembered not the bro@@ ther@@ ly covenant :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Mo@@ ab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of E@@ dom into lime :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
and the songs of the temple shall be how@@ lings in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD :
they that swear by the sin of Sam@@ aria , and say , Th@@ y god , O Dan , liv@@ eth ; and , The manner of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba liv@@ eth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is si@@ fted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that the P@@ low@@ man shall over@@ take the re@@ aper , and the T@@ reader of grapes him that s@@ ow@@ eth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the he@@ a@@ then drink continually , ye@@ a , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and they said every one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jon@@ ah .
and the LORD God prepared a gour@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the gour@@ d .
pass ye away , thou inhabit@@ ant of S@@ aph@@ ir , having thy shame naked : the inhabit@@ ant of Za@@ an@@ an came not forth in the mourning of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ el ; he shall receive of you his standing .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and fl@@ ay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry unto the LORD , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ rian shall come into our land : and when he shall t@@ read in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shep@@ herds , and eight principal men .
who is a God like unto thee , that par@@ don@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity , and pass@@ eth by the trans@@ g@@ ression of the remn@@ ant of his heritage ? he ret@@ ain@@ eth not his anger for ever , because he deli@@ ght@@ eth in mercy .
God is jeal@@ ous , and the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth ; the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserv@@ eth wrath for his enemies .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierc@@ eness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will aff@@ l@@ ict thee no more .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feed@@ ing@@ place of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whel@@ p , and none made them afraid ?
art thou better than populous No , that was situ@@ ate among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose ram@@ part was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remn@@ ant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
thou art filled with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy fores@@ kin be uncovered : the cup of the LORD 's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spe@@ wing shall be on thy glory .
O LORD , I have heard thy speech , and was afraid : O LORD , revive thy work in the midst of the years , in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy .
the word of the LORD which came unto Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of C@@ ush@@ i , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of A@@ mari@@ ah , the son of Hiz@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Jud@@ ah .
seek ye the LORD , all ye me@@ ek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek me@@ ek@@ ness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD 's anger .
the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the press@@ fat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
and many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant the BR@@ AN@@ CH .
then he answered and sp@@ ake unto me , saying , This is the word of the LORD unto Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the hands of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; I am returned unto Z@@ ion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain .
Ash@@ kel@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ row@@ ful , and Ek@@ ron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ash@@ kel@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and the LORD shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the LORD GO@@ D shall blow the trum@@ pet , and shall go with whir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
and they shall be as mighty men , which t@@ read down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the LORD is with them , and the riders on horses shall be conf@@ ounded .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad and Lab@@ an@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
whose poss@@ essors sl@@ ay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , Bless@@ ed be the LORD ; for I am rich : and their own shep@@ herds pity them not .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mu@@ le , of the cam@@ el , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stum@@ ble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Lev@@ i , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the LORD will cut off the man that do@@ eth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tab@@ ern@@ acles of Jacob , and him that off@@ er@@ eth an offering unto the LORD of hosts .
for the LORD , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith that he hat@@ eth putting away : for one cover@@ eth violence with his garment , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts : therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treach@@ er@@ ously .
and he shall sit as a refin@@ er and puri@@ fer of silver : and he shall puri@@ fy the sons of Lev@@ i , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness .
then they that feared the LORD sp@@ ake often one to another : and the LORD hear@@ k@@ ened , and heard it , and a book of rem@@ embrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD , and that thought upon his name .
and was there until the death of Her@@ od : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
but when he saw many of the Pharis@@ ees and Sad@@ duc@@ ees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vi@@ pers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and now also the ax@@ e is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which desp@@ it@@ efully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
when Jesus heard it , he marv@@ elled , and said to them that followed , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebu@@ ked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Ger@@ g@@ es@@ en@@ es , there met him two possessed with dev@@ ils , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then sa@@ ith he to the sick of the pal@@ sy , ) A@@ rise , take up thy bed , and go unto th@@ ine house .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against un@@ clean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
the men of N@@ inev@@ eh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they rep@@ ented at the preaching of Jon@@ as ; and , behold , a greater than Jon@@ as is here .
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
he also that received seed among the thor@@ ns is he that he@@ areth the word ; and the care of this world , and the dece@@ it@@ fulness of riches , cho@@ ke the word , and he becom@@ eth un@@ fruitful .
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becom@@ eth a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
a wicked and adul@@ ter@@ ous generation see@@ ket@@ h after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jon@@ as . and he left them , and departed .
take heed that ye desp@@ ise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
and I say unto you , Wh@@ oso@@ ever shall put away his wife , except it be for for@@ n@@ ication , and shall marry another , commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery : and wh@@ os@@ o marri@@ eth her which is put away do@@ th commit adul@@ tery .
and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
and when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority do@@ est thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
but when the Hus@@ band@@ men saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
his lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
the Son of man go@@ eth as it is written of him : but w@@ oe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
then com@@ eth he to his disciples , and sa@@ ith unto them , S@@ leep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smo@@ te off his ear .
then Jud@@ as , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , rep@@ ented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
and sa@@ ith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , sh@@ ew thy@@ self to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and when they could not come ni@@ gh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the sick of the pal@@ sy lay .
and it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many public@@ ans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
when Jesus heard it , he sa@@ ith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
no man also se@@ w@@ eth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up tak@@ eth away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man put@@ t@@ eth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine do@@ th burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be mar@@ red : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
how he went into the house of God in the days of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the high priest , and did eat the sh@@ ew@@ bread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sab@@ bath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
and he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye met@@ e , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
and they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legi@@ on , sitting , and clo@@ thed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and king Her@@ od heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do sh@@ ew forth themselves in him .
and he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and sa@@ ith unto them , Be of good che@@ er : it is I ; be not afraid .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can def@@ ile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that def@@ ile the man .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had sp@@ it on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
and he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and he said unto them , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
and Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tab@@ ern@@ acles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Eli@@ as .
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life ma@@ im@@ ed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but Jesus answ@@ er@@ eth again , and sa@@ ith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
and they said unto him , We can . and Jesus said unto them , Y@@ e shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized with@@ al shall ye be baptized :
and Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the ev@@ enti@@ de was come , he went out unto Beth@@ any with the twelve .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the syn@@ agogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
but when ye shall see the ab@@ om@@ ination of des@@ ol@@ ation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that read@@ eth understand , ) then let them that be in Juda@@ ea flee to the mountains :
the Son of man indeed go@@ eth , as it is written of him : but w@@ oe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and some began to sp@@ it on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Proph@@ esy : and the servants did strike him with the pal@@ ms of their hands .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Su@@ rely thou art one of them : for thou art a Gal@@ il@@ a@@ ean , and thy speech agre@@ eth there@@ to .
and the second time the cock crew . and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock c@@ row twice , thou shalt deny me thr@@ ice . and when he thought there@@ on , he we@@ pt .
and one ran and filled a sp@@ un@@ ge full of vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a re@@ ed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Eli@@ as will come to take him down .
and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re which was he@@ wn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and up@@ bra@@ ided them with their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the Lord was with him .
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ ilee , out of the city of Naz@@ areth , into Juda@@ ea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and line@@ age of David : )
and when eight days were accomplished for the circum@@ c@@ ising of the child , his name was called J@@ ES@@ US , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
and , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Sim@@ eon ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
and Sim@@ eon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Be@@ hold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
and now also the ax@@ e is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? and he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any fal@@ sely ; and be content with your wages .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and he came to Naz@@ areth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sab@@ bath day , and stood up for to read .
and there came a fear on all : and they glori@@ fied God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .

a s@@ ower went out to sow his seed : and as he s@@ owed , some fell by the way side ; and it was tro@@ dden down , and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air dev@@ oured it .
and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundre@@ d@@ fold . and when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and he said , Un@@ to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in par@@ ables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
and that which fell among thor@@ ns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are cho@@ ked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
and they came to him , and aw@@ oke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . then he arose , and rebu@@ ked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .

from the blood of A@@ bel unto the blood of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
if then God so clo@@ the the grass , which is to day in the field , and to mor@@ row is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he com@@ eth and kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h , they may open unto him immediately .
and the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise ste@@ ward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
and he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Be@@ hold , I cast out dev@@ ils , and I do cures to day and to mor@@ row , and the third day I shall be perf@@ ected .
behold , your house is left unto you des@@ ol@@ ate : and verily I say unto you , Y@@ e shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Bless@@ ed is he that com@@ eth in the name of the Lord .

they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he which shall be upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a viney@@ ard , and let it forth to Hus@@ band@@ men , and went into a far country for a long time .
beware of the scri@@ bes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the syn@@ agogues , and the chief rooms at fe@@ asts ;
as for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a pur@@ se , let him take it , and likewise his scri@@ p : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .

so when they had row@@ ed about five and twenty or thirty fur@@ l@@ ongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing ni@@ gh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which se@@ eth the Son , and believ@@ eth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
if a man on the sab@@ bath day receive circum@@ cision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every wh@@ it whole on the sab@@ bath day ?

but he that is an hi@@ rel@@ ing , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , se@@ eth the wolf coming , and leav@@ eth the sheep , and fle@@ eth : and the wolf cat@@ ch@@ eth them , and sc@@ atter@@ eth the sheep .
Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Mar@@ tha , the sister of him that was dead , sa@@ ith unto him , Lord , by this time he st@@ in@@ ket@@ h : for he hath been dead four days .
then took Mary a pound of o@@ int@@ ment of sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard , very costly , and ano@@ inted the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the od@@ our of the o@@ int@@ ment .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persec@@ ute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall we@@ ep and lam@@ ent , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sor@@ row@@ ful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
these things have I spoken unto you in prover@@ bs : but the time com@@ eth , when I shall no more speak unto you in prover@@ bs , but I shall sh@@ ew you plainly of the Father .
these things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribu@@ lation : but be of good che@@ er ; I have overcome the world .
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
and Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
then led they Jesus from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be de@@ filed ; but that they might eat the pas@@ sover .
then said Pil@@ ate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great f@@ ishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , sa@@ ith he , ye have heard of me .
beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
then Peter said unto them , Rep@@ ent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the rem@@ is@@ sion of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glori@@ fied God for that which was done .
for of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast ano@@ inted , both Her@@ od , and Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate , with the Genti@@ les , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
saying , Did not we stra@@ itly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man 's blood upon us .
and the next day he sh@@ ew@@ ed himself unto them as they stro@@ ve , and would have set them at one again , saying , S@@ irs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
but he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
and there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named An@@ ani@@ as ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , An@@ ani@@ as . and he said , Be@@ hold , I am here , Lord .
but the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Genti@@ les , and kings , and the children of Israel :
and when he had ap@@ preh@@ ended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four qu@@ ater@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; inten@@ ding after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
and the angel said unto him , G@@ ird thy@@ self , and bind on thy sand@@ als . and so he did . and he sa@@ ith unto him , C@@ ast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
that the resi@@ due of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Genti@@ les , upon whom my name is called , sa@@ ith the Lord , who do@@ eth all these things .
and this did she many days . but Paul , being griev@@ ed , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and the keeper of the prison aw@@ aking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had been fled .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being ferv@@ ent in the spirit , he sp@@ ake and taught dilig@@ ently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
then certain of the vag@@ ab@@ ond Jews , Ex@@ or@@ cists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , We ad@@ j@@ ure you by Jesus whom Paul pre@@ ach@@ eth .
for Paul had determined to sail by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he ha@@ sted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentec@@ ost .
as touching the Genti@@ les which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strang@@ led , and from for@@ n@@ ication .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and bec@@ k@@ oned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he sp@@ ake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and b@@ ade that he should be examined by scour@@ ging ; that he might know where@@ fore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with th@@ ongs , Paul said unto the cent@@ ur@@ ion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and un@@ condemned ?
then said Paul , I w@@ ist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have sl@@ ain Paul .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ k@@ oned unto him to speak , answered , for@@ as@@ much as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheer@@ fully answer for myself :
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
but the cent@@ ur@@ ion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
and the barbar@@ ous people sh@@ ew@@ ed us no little kindness : for they kind@@ led a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
and from th@@ ence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Ap@@ pi@@ i@@ forum , and The three ta@@ vern@@ s : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is un@@ seem@@ ly , and receiving in themselves that re@@ comp@@ ence of their error which was meet .
whom God hath set forth to be a prop@@ iti@@ ation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the rem@@ is@@ sion of sins that are past , through the for@@ bear@@ ance of God ;
and the father of circum@@ cision to them who are not of the circum@@ cision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised .
for if by one man 's offence death re@@ igned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to w@@ it , the redemption of our body .
and be not con@@ formed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renew@@ ing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . wil@@ t thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing un@@ clean of itself : but to him that este@@ em@@ eth any thing to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Genti@@ les , minist@@ ering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Genti@@ les might be acceptable , being sancti@@ fied by the Holy Ghost .
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Genti@@ les have been made part@@ akers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in car@@ nal things .
for who mak@@ eth thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou did@@ st not receive ? now if thou did@@ st receive it , why d@@ ost thou glory , as if thou had@@ st not received it ?
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sancti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liv@@ eth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my gl@@ or@@ ying void .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also sa@@ ith the law .
I bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Step@@ han@@ as , that it is the fir@@ st@@ fruits of Ac@@ ha@@ ia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
but have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of dis@@ honesty , not walking in craft@@ iness , nor handling the word of God dece@@ it@@ fully ; but by manifestation of the truth comm@@ ending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
for though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epist@@ le hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
but I bes@@ e@@ ech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , where@@ with I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cur@@ sed is every one that continu@@ eth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
and this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , C@@ AN@@ NOT dis@@ ann@@ ul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lu@@ sts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
from whom the whole body fit@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint suppl@@ i@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body unto the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
I know both how to be ab@@ ased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
but I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Ep@@ aph@@ ro@@ dit@@ us the things which were sent from you , an od@@ our of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , well@@ pleasing to God .
let no man be@@ gu@@ ile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and wor@@ shipping of angels , intru@@ ding into those things which he hath not seen , v@@ ain@@ ly pu@@ ffed up by his fl@@ esh@@ ly mind ,
but even after that we had suffered before , and were sham@@ efully entre@@ ated , as ye know , at Philipp@@ i , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
W@@ herefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without prefer@@ ring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
thou hast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for the law mak@@ eth men high priests which have in@@ firm@@ ity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , mak@@ eth the Son , who is consec@@ rated for ever@@ more .
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the trans@@ gres@@ sions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that com@@ eth to God must believe that he is , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of them that dilig@@ ently seek him .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of Bar@@ ak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ eph@@ th@@ ae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whi@@ ther@@ soever the governor list@@ eth .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the hus@@ band@@ man wa@@ it@@ eth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very p@@ iti@@ ful , and of tender mercy .
Eli@@ as was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed ear@@ ne@@ stly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
elect according to the fore@@ knowledge of God the Father , through sanc@@ tification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprink@@ ling of the blood of Jesus Christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath be@@ gotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
for@@ as@@ much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who priv@@ ily shall bring in dam@@ n@@ able here@@ sies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of un@@ clean@@ ness , and desp@@ ise government . presu@@ mp@@ tuous are they , self@@ w@@ illed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dig@@ n@@ ities .
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again ent@@ angled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spir@@ its which are before his throne ;
but unto you I say , and unto the rest in T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lam@@ b , having every one of them har@@ ps , and golden vi@@ als full of od@@ ours , which are the prayers of saints .
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were sl@@ ain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and w@@ ast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast re@@ igned .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were light@@ nings , and voices , and thunder@@ ings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old ser@@ pent , called the Devil , and Satan , which decei@@ v@@ eth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
for they are the spirits of dev@@ ils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Th@@ us with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the f@@ ow@@ ls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the sup@@ per of the great God ;
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that de@@ fil@@ eth , neither whatsoever work@@ eth ab@@ om@@ ination , or mak@@ eth a lie : but they which are written in the Lam@@ b 's book of life .
