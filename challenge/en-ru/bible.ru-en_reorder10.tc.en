Moses and Aaron did so , as Yahweh commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , " entreat Yahweh , that he take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may sacrifice to Yahweh . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your rod , and strike the dust of the earth , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt . ' "

Yahweh did so ; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies .
Pharaoh said , " I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness , only you shall not go very far away . pray for me . "
Moses said , " Behold , I go out from you , and I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , tomorrow ; only don 't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh . "
then Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "

Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh . the thunders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh 's .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Yahweh .
the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you , when I strike the land of Egypt .
" ' seven days you shall eat unleavened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leavened , that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
for Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lintel , and on the two doorposts , Yahweh will pass over the door , and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it happened at midnight , that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
Moses said to the people , " Remember this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place . no leavened bread shall be eaten .
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth ; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt .
every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons .
it happened , when Pharaoh had let the people go , that God didn 't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , " Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war , and they return to Egypt " ;
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swear , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you . "
Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled ; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people , and they said , " What is this we have done , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? "
Moses said to the people , " Don 't be afraid . stand still , and see the salvation of Yahweh , which he will work for you today : for the Egyptians whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies , over his chariots , and over his horsemen .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .

these words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more . he wrote them on two tables of stone , and gave them to me .
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
but as for you , stand here by me , and I will tell you all the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which you shall teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it . "
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire . you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them , nor take it for yourself , lest you be snared in it ; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
Yahweh said to me , " Arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image . "
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yahweh gave them to me .
and you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Asherim with fire ; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your needy , and to your poor , in your land .
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
then you shall take an awl , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Levite , and the foreigner , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within your gates .
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire diligently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in Israel ,
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Yahweh has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
this is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , chariots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yahweh your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall tell them , " Hear , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don 't let your heart faint ; don 't be afraid , nor tremble , neither be scared of them ;
what man is there who has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .

and behold , he has accused her of shameful things , saying , ' I didn 't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity ; ' and yet these are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity . " they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
when you reap your harvest in your field , and have forgot a sheaf in the field , you shall not go again to get it : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow ; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
therefore it shall be , when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around , in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it , that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky ; you shall not forget .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
'Cursed is the man who makes an engraved or molten image , an abomination to Yahweh , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and sets it up in secret . ' all the people shall answer and say , ' Amen . '
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
Yahweh will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with blight , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send against you , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck , until he has destroyed you .
it shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick ;
the secret things belong to Yahweh our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse : therefore choose life , that you may live , you and your seed ;
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither forsake you : Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yahweh your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
but Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sleek . then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
" see now that I , even I , am he , There is no god with me . I kill , and I make alive . I wound , and I heal . there is no one who can deliver out of my hand .
" go up into this mountain of Abarim , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and see the land of Canaan , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and she said to the men , " I know that Yahweh has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
for we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you , when you came out of Egypt ; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon and to Og , whom you utterly destroyed .
Joshua said , " Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Hivite , and the Perizzite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Jebusite out from before you .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
he said , " No ; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh 's army . " Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and worshipped , and said to him , " What does my lord say to his servant ? "
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things ; for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yahweh 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
therefore the children of Israel can 't stand before their enemies . they turn their backs before their enemies , because they have become devoted for destruction . I will not be with you any more , unless you destroy the devoted things from among you .
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
you shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king , except its spoil and its livestock , you shall take for a plunder for yourselves . set an ambush for the city behind it . "
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of uncut stones , on which no man had lifted up any iron . they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , and sacrificed peace offerings .
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a covenant with us . "
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the Anakim from the hill country , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the hill country of Judah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
in the hill country , and in the lowland , and in the Arabah , and in the slopes , and in the wilderness , and in the South ; the Hittite , the Amorite , and the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite :
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim , even all the Sidonians ; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
and in the valley , Beth Haram , Beth Nimrah , Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , the Jordan 's bank , to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
she said , " Give me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho , at the waters of Jericho on the east , even the wilderness , going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
they didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh , for he was the firstborn of Joseph . as for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
they came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying , " Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers . " therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .
the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , " Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance , since I am a great people , because Yahweh has blessed me so far ? "
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward . it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven .
out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
the children of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , out of the tribe of Asher , out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh in Bashan .
the children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben , out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun .
they gave to the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Be Eshterah with its suburbs ; two cities .
" the Mighty One , God , Yahweh , the Mighty One , God , Yahweh , he knows ; and Israel shall know : if it was in rebellion , or if in trespass against Yahweh ( don 't save us this day ) ,
" far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh , and turn away this day from following Yahweh , to build an altar for burnt offering , for meal offering , or for sacrifice , besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle ! "
the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and spoke no more of going up against them to war , to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived .
behold , I have allotted to you these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from the Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
" but if you do at all go back , and hold fast to the remnant of these nations , even these who remain among you , and make marriages with them , and go in to them , and they to you ;
Joshua said to all the people , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River , even Terah , the father of Abraham , and the father of Nahor : and they served other gods .
it happened , when she came , that she got him to ask her father for a field : and she alighted from off her donkey ; and Caleb said to her , " What would you like ? "
the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him , " Please show us the entrance into the city , and we will deal kindly with you . "
and they forsook Yahweh , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yahweh to anger .
yet they didn 't listen to their judges ; for they played the prostitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obeying the commandments of Yahweh . they didn 't do so .
when Yahweh raised them up judges , then Yahweh was with the judge , and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them .
but when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised them up a savior , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a man left @-@ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
he said to them , " Follow me ; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . " they followed him , and took the Fords of the Jordan against the Moabites , and didn 't allow any man to pass over .
Barak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don 't be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inquires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Machir . those who handle the marshal 's staff came out of Zebulun .
and I said to you , " I am Yahweh your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
it happened the same night , that Yahweh said to him , " Take your father 's bull , even the second bull seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has , and cut down the Asherah that is by it ;
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
behold , I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and encamped beside the spring of Harod : and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yahweh said to Gideon , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink . "
Yahweh said to Gideon , " By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into your hand . let all the other people go , each to his own place . "
so the people took food in their hand , and their trumpets ; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men : and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the outermost part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
the three companies blew the trumpets , and broke the pitchers , and held the torches in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow ; and they shouted , " The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon ! "
they blew the three hundred trumpets , and Yahweh set every man 's sword against his fellow , and against all the army ; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah , as far as the border of Abel Meholah , by Tabbath .
the men of Ephraim said to him , " Why have you treated us this way , that you didn 't call us , when you went to fight with Midian ? " they rebuked him sharply .
he said to the men of Succoth , " Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me ; for they are faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian . "
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
he came to the men of Succoth , and said , " See Zebah and Zalmunna , concerning whom you taunted me , saying , ' Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are weary ? ' "
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " Listen to me , you men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
" the bramble said to the trees , ' If in truth you anoint me king over you , then come and take refuge in my shade ; and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon . '
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ;
but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech . "
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
then Zebul said to him , " Now where is your mouth , that you said , ' Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? ' isn 't this the people that you have despised ? please go out now and fight with them . "
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
all the people likewise each cut down his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them at the base of the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer , and said to him , " Draw your sword , and kill me , that men not say of me , ' A woman killed him . ' his young man thrust him through , and he died . "
they troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year . for eighteen years , they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
Gilead 's wife bore him sons ; and when his wife 's sons grew up , they drove out Jephthah , and said to him , " You shall not inherit in our father 's house ; for you are the son of another woman . "
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith , even twenty cities , and to Abelcheramim , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
when I saw that you didn 't save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Yahweh delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
the Gileadites took the Fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites . it was so , that when the fugitives of Ephraim said , " Let me go over , " the men of Gilead said to him , " Are you an Ephraimite ? " if he said , " No " ;
but he said to me , ' Behold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death . ' "
then Manoah entreated Yahweh , and said , " Oh , Lord , please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah , " Though you detain me , I won 't eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Yahweh . " for Manoah didn 't know that he was the angel of Yahweh .
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
but his wife said to him , " If Yahweh were pleased to kill us , he wouldn 't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand , neither would he have shown us all these things , nor would at this time have told such things as these . "
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion : and behold , there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
Samson said to them , " Let me tell you a riddle now . if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing ;
they spoke to him , saying , " No ; but we will bind you fast , and deliver you into their hand ; but surely we will not kill you . " they bound him with two new ropes , and brought him up from the rock .
he was very thirsty , and called on Yahweh , and said , " You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? "
she fastened it with the pin , and said to him , " The Philistines are on you , Samson ! " he awakened out of his sleep , and plucked away the pin of the beam , and the web .
she said , " The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! " he awoke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he didn 't know that Yahweh had departed from him .
the Philistines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
it happened , when their hearts were merry , that they said , " Call for Samson , that he may entertain us . " they called for Samson out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
Samson called to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , remember me , please , and strengthen me , please , only this once , God , that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes . "
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engraved image and a molten image : and it was in the house of Micah .
Micah said to him , " Dwell with me , and be to me a father and a priest , and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year , a suit of clothing , and your food . " so the Levite went in .
then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered , and said to their brothers , " Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod , and teraphim , and an engraved image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what you have to do . "
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the donkey ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
it was so , that all who saw it said , " There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day ! consider it , take counsel , and speak . "
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
the children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening ; and they asked of Yahweh , saying , " Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? " Yahweh said , " Go up against him . "
and Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , stood before it in those days ) , saying , " Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother , or shall I cease ? " Yahweh said , " Go up ; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand . "
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant , and commanded them , saying , " Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the little ones .
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
they said , " Behold , there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh , which is on the north of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah . "
it happened in the days when the judges judged , that there was a famine in the land . a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they lived there about ten years .
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , " Let me now go to the field , and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor . " she said to her , " Go , my daughter . "
she said , ' Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves . ' so she came , and has continued even from the morning until now , except that she stayed a little in the house . "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
it shall be , when he lies down , that you shall mark the place where he shall lie , and you shall go in , and uncover his feet , and lay down ; then he will tell you what you shall do . "
now Boaz went up to the gate , and sat down there . behold , the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by ; to whom he said , " Come over here , friend , and sit down ! " he turned aside , and sat down .
then Boaz said , " On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi , you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance . "
now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man took off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was the way of attestation in Israel .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Naomi " ; and they named him Obed . he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim , of the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite :
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a fork of three teeth in his hand ;
yes , before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man who sacrificed , " Give meat to roast for the priest ; for he will not accept boiled meat from you , but raw . "
the man of yours , whom I shall not cut off from my altar , shall consume your eyes , and grieve your heart ; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
therefore Eli said to Samuel , " Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Speak , Yahweh ; for your servant hears . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the people had come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , " Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines ? let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us , that it may come among us , and save us out of the hand of our enemies . "
the man said to Eli , " I am he who came out of the army , and I fled today out of the army . " he said , " How did the matter go , my son ? "
he who brought the news answered , " Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people . your two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God has been captured . "
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
then they said , " What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him ? " they said , " Five golden tumors , and five golden mice , for the number of the lords of the Philistines ; for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and take the ark of Yahweh , and lay it on the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which you return him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by its side ; and send it away , that it may go .
the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh , and the coffer that was with it , in which the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh .
when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and they shall run before his chariots ;
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
then Saul said to his servant , " But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God . what do we have ? "
as for your donkeys who were lost three days ago , don 't set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
" you shall go down before me to Gilgal ; and behold , I will come down to you , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : you shall wait seven days , until I come to you , and show you what you shall do . "
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , " Where did you go ? " he said , " To seek the donkeys . when we saw that they were not found , we came to Samuel . "
Samuel said to all the people , " You see him whom Yahweh has chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? " all the people shouted , and said , " Let the king live ! "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
the elders of Jabesh said to him , " Give us seven day , that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel ; and then , if there is no one to save us , we will come out to you . "
" but they forgot Yahweh their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab ; and they fought against them .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
Samuel said , " What have you done ? " Saul said , " Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that you didn 't come within the days appointed , and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash ;
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled ; and the earth quaked : so there was an exceeding great trembling .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
it happened , while Saul talked to the priest , that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said to the priest , " Withdraw your hand ! "
the men of Israel were distressed that day ; for Saul had adjured the people , saying , " Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening , and I am avenged of my enemies . " so none of the people tasted food .
but Jonathan didn 't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then one of the people answered , and said , " Your father directly commanded the people with an oath , saying , ' Cursed is the man who eats food this day . ' " the people were faint .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
Saul said , " They have brought them from the Amalekites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Yahweh your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh , and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
but Yahweh said to Samuel , " Don 't look on his face , or on the height of his stature ; because I have rejected him : for I see not as man sees ; for man looks at the outward appearance , but Yahweh looks at the heart . "
let our lord now command your servants who are before you , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp . it shall happen , when the evil spirit from God is on you , that he shall play with his hand , and you shall be well . "
David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the place of the wagons , as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
David spoke to the men who stood by him , saying , " What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine , and takes away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ? "
David said , " Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Yahweh shall be with you . "
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine , he said to Abner , the captain of the army , " Abner , whose son is this youth ? " Abner said , " As your soul lives , O king , I can 't tell . "
David went out wherever Saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely : and Saul set him over the men of war , and it was good in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of Saul 's servants .
Saul was very angry , and this saying displeased him ; and he said , " They have ascribed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands . what can he have more but the kingdom ? "
Saul said , " You shall tell David , ' The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king 's enemies . ' " now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
Saul said to Michal , " Why have you deceived me thus , and let my enemy go , so that he is escaped ? " Michal answered Saul , " He said to me , ' Let me go ! why should I kill you ? ' "
David said to Jonathan , " Behold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
it happened on the next day after the new moon , the second day , that David 's place was empty . Saul said to Jonathan his son , " Why doesn 't the son of Jesse come to eat , neither yesterday , nor today ? "
then Saul 's anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said to him , " You son of a perverse rebellious woman , don 't I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame , and to the shame of your mother 's nakedness ?
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kissed one another , and wept one with another , and David wept the most .
the servants of Achish said to him , " isn 't this David the king of the land ? didn 't they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was discontented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , " Who among all your servants is so faithful as David , who is the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law , and is taken into your council , and is honorable in your house ?
he struck Nob , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and donkeys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
David said to Abiathar , " I knew on that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father 's house .
will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as your servant has heard ? Yahweh , the God of Israel , I beg you , tell your servant . " Yahweh said , " He will come down . "
then David said , " Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? " Yahweh said , " They will deliver you up . "
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
she fell at his feet , and said , " On me , my lord , on me be the iniquity ; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears . hear the words of your handmaid .
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " Behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , brother to Joab , saying , " Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? " Abishai said , " I will go down with you . "
this thing isn 't good that you have done . as Yahweh lives , you are worthy to die , because you have not kept watch over your lord , Yahweh 's anointed . now see where the king 's spear is , and the jar of water that was at his head . "
Achish said , " Against whom have you made a raid today ? " David said , " Against the South of Judah , against the South of the Jerahmeelites , and against the South of the Kenites . "
moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines . "
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley , and those who were beyond the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
it happened after this , that David inquired of Yahweh , saying , " Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah ? " Yahweh said to him , " Go up . " David said , " Where shall I go up ? " he said , " To Hebron . "
Abner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
David sent messengers to Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , saying , " Deliver me my wife Michal , whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines . "
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
then Joab came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? behold , Abner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
Saul 's son had two men who were captains of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin ( for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin :
David commanded his young men , and they killed them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron . but they took the head of Ishbosheth , and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron .
David inquired of Yahweh , saying , " Shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to David , " Go up ; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand . "
David arose , and went with all the people who were with him , from Baale Judah , to bring up from there the ark of God , which is called by the Name , even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits above the cherubim .
it was so , as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
David said to Michal , " It was before Yahweh , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men ;
he struck Moab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
of Syria , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , and of Amalek , and of the spoil of Hadadezer , son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba , and they called him to David ; and the king said to him , " Are you Ziba ? " he said , " Your servant is he . "
the king said , " Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may show the kindness of God to him ? " Ziba said to the king , " Jonathan has yet a son , who is lame of his feet . "
the king said to him , " Where is he ? " Ziba said to the king , " Behold , he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , in Lo debar . "
David said to him , " Don 't be afraid of him ; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father 's sake , and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father . you shall eat bread at my table continually . "
then Ziba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so Mephibosheth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob , and the Syrians of Zobah , twenty thousand footmen , and the king of Maacah with one thousand men , and the men of Tob twelve thousand men .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
when they had told David , saying , " Uriah didn 't go down to his house , " David said to Uriah , " Haven 't you come from a journey ? why didn 't you go down to your house ? "
Nathan said to David , " You are the man . this is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says : ' I anointed you king over Israel , and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul .
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bosom , and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
" this is what Yahweh says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and anointed himself , and changed his clothing ; and he came into the house of Yahweh , and worshiped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he ate .
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
I , where would I carry my shame ? and as for you , you will be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , please speak to the king ; for he will not withhold me from you . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
then she said , " Please let the king remember Yahweh your God , that the Avenger of blood destroy not any more , lest they destroy my son . " he said , " As Yahweh lives , not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth . "
for we must die , and are as water split on the ground , which can 't be gathered up again ; neither does God take away life , but devises means , that he who is banished not be an outcast from him .
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
Joab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Joab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
then the king said to Ittai the Gittite , " Why do you also go with us ? return , and stay with the king ; for you are a foreigner , and also an exile . return to your own place .
all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Zadok also came , and all the Levites with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God ; and they set down the ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
the king said to Zadok , " Carry back the ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his habitation ;
when David was a little past the top , behold , Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him , with a couple of donkeys saddled , and on them two hundred loaves of bread , and one hundred clusters of raisins , and one hundred summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
the king said , " Where is your master 's son ? " Ziba said to the king , " Behold , he is staying in Jerusalem ; for he said , ' Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father . ' "
then the king said to Ziba , " Behold , all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours . " Ziba said , " I do obeisance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have reigned ! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son ! behold , you are caught by your own mischief , because you are a man of blood ! "
the king said , " What have I to do with you , you sons of Zeruiah ? because he curses , and because Yahweh has said to him , ' Curse David ; ' who then shall say , ' Why have you done so ? ' "
Hushai said to Absalom , " No ; but whomever Yahweh , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
Ahithophel said to Absalom , " Go in to your father 's concubines , that he has left to keep the house . then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father . then the hands of all who are with you will be strong . "
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , ' Don 't lodge this night at the Fords of the wilderness , but by all means pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people who are with him . ' "
now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel ; and a female servant used to go and tell them ; and they went and told king David . for they might not be seen to come into the city .
Absalom 's servants came to the woman to the house ; and they said , " Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? " the woman said to them , " They have gone over the brook of water . " when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
it happened , after they had departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David ; and they said to David , " Arise and pass quickly over the water ; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you . "
the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain , and outran the Cushite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watchman saw another man running ; and the watchman called to the porter , and said , " Behold , a man running alone ! " the king said , " He also brings news . "
the watchman said , " I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . " the king said , " He is a good man , and comes with good news . "
the king said , " Is it well with the young man Absalom ? " Ahimaaz answered , " When Joab sent the king 's servant , even me your servant , I saw a great tumult , but I don 't know what it was . "
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . they told to all the people , saying , " Behold , the king is sitting in the gate . " all the people came before the king . now Israel had fled every man to his tent .
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
a ferry boat went to bring over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king , when he had come over the Jordan .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said to the king , " Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away , and brought the king , and his household , over the Jordan , and all David 's men with him ? "
they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah , and they cast up a mound against the city , and it stood against the rampart ; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall , to throw it down .
and David said to the Gibeonites , " What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make atonement , that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh ? "
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us , and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul , the chosen of Yahweh . " the king said , " I will give them . "
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
and Ishbibenob , who was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight , he being armed with a new sword , thought to have slain David .
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him , and struck the Philistine , and killed him . then the men of David swore to him , saying , " You shall go no more out with us to battle , that you don 't quench the lamp of Israel . "
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh .
he said , " Be it far from me , Yahweh , that I should do this ! isn 't it the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives ? " therefore he would not drink it . the three mighty men did these things .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spear .
they passed over the Jordan , and encamped in Aroer , on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad , and to Jazer :
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
Araunah said , " Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? " David said , " To buy your threshing floor , to build an altar to Yahweh , that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people . "
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Absalom .
he has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the army ; but he hasn 't called Solomon your servant .
for he is gone down this day , and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the king 's sons , and the captains of the army , and Abiathar the priest . behold , they are eating and drinking before him , and say , ' Long live king Adonijah ! '
most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah . "
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
it was told Solomon , saying , " Behold , Adonijah fears king Solomon ; for , behold , he has laid hold on the horns of the altar , saying , ' Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword . ' "
now therefore don 't hold him guiltless , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood . "
Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon , to speak to him for Adonijah . the king rose up to meet her , and bowed himself to her , and sat down on his throne , and caused a throne to be set for the king 's mother ; and she sat on his right hand .
it was told king Solomon , " Joab has fled to the Tent of Yahweh , and behold , he is by the altar . " then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , " Go , fall on him . "
Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh , and said to him , " Thus says the king , ' Come forth ! ' " he said , " No ; but I will die here . " Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , " Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me . "
the king said to him , " Do as he has said , and fall on him , and bury him ; that you may take away the blood , which Joab shed without cause , from me and from my father 's house .
so shall their blood return on the head of Joab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Yahweh . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath . they told Shimei , saying , " Behold , your servants are in Gath . "

and he said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven above , or on earth beneath ; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sinned , and have done perversely ; we have dealt wickedly ; '
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to Yahweh , two and twenty thousand head of cattle , and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh .

as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .

he said to Jeroboam , " Take ten pieces ; for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Behold , I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to you
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "

when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah , and the tribe of Benjamin , a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .

for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
Jeroboam said to his wife , " Please get up and disguise yourself , that you won 't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam . go to Shiloh . behold , there is Ahijah the prophet , who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people .

for all the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , which they sinned , and with which they made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver ; and he built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Shemer , the owner of the hill , Samaria .

Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .

he said to his servant , " Go up now , look toward the sea . " he went up , and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " he said , " Go again " seven times .

Ahab said to Elijah , " Have you found me , my enemy ? " he answered , " I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh .
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .

the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " Surely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Jehoshaphat cried out .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the ivory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he walked in all the way of Asa his father ; He didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .

Elijah said to Elisha , " Please wait here , for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel . " Elisha said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they went down to Bethel .
the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha , and said to him , " Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today ? " he said , " Yes , I know it ; hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Elisha , please wait here , for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho . " he said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they came to Jericho .

it happened , when they had gone over , that Elijah said to Elisha , " Ask what I shall do for you , before I am taken from you . " Elisha said , " Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me . "
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
the men of the city said to Elisha , " Behold , please , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land miscarries . "

but Jehoshaphat said , " isn 't there here a prophet of Yahweh , that we may inquire of Yahweh by him ? " one of the king of Israel 's servants answered , " Elisha the son of Shaphat is here , who poured water on the hands of Elijah . "

Elisha came again to Gilgal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . "
but he said , " Then bring meal . " he cast it into the pot ; and he said , " Pour out for the people , that they may eat . " there was no harm in the pot .
his servant said , " What , should I set this before a hundred men ? " but he said , " Give the people , that they may eat ; for thus says Yahweh , ' They will eat , and will have some left over . ' "
now Naaman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of valor , but he was a leper .
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
but Naaman was angry , and went away , and said , " Behold , I thought , ' He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Yahweh his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the leper . '
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " Won 't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
when the servant of the man of God had risen early , and gone out , behold , an army with horses and chariots was around the city . his servant said to him , " Alas , my master ! what shall we do ? "
when they came down to him , Elisha prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
it happened , when they had come into Samaria , that Elisha said , " Yahweh , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yahweh opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .

Elisha said , " Hear the word of Yahweh . thus says Yahweh , ' Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the gate of Samaria . ' "
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
the people went out , and plundered the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of Yahweh .
the king said to Hazael , " Take a present in your hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of Yahweh by him , saying , ' Will I recover from this sickness ? ' "

then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said to him , " Is all well ? why did this mad fellow come to you ? " he said to them , " You know the man and what his talk was . "
now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel , and he spied the company of Jehu as he came , and said , " I see a company . " Joram said , " Take a horseman , and send to meet them , and let him say , ' Is it peace ? ' "
then he sent out a second on horseback , who came to them , and said , " Thus says the king , ' Is it peace ? ' " Jehu answered , " What do you have to do with peace ? fall in behind me ! "
therefore they came back , and told him . he said , " This is the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , ' The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel ,
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?

in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard , and brought them to him into the house of Yahweh ; and he made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh , and showed them the king 's son .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
then he brought out the king 's son , and put the crown on him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , " Long live the king ! "
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died : and Joash the king of Israel came down to him , and wept over him , and said , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! "
the man of God was angry with him , and said , " You should have struck five or six times . then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it , whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times . "
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth Shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as his fathers had done : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Menahem exacted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . so the king of Assyria turned back , and didn 't stay there in the land .

in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , " Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the law of the god of the land . "
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Asherah : and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it ; and he called it Nehushtan .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebnah , and Joah , said to Rabshakeh , " Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it . Don 't speak with us in the Jews ' language , in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
Don 't listen to Hezekiah . ' for thus says the king of Assyria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone of you eat of his vine , and everyone of his fig tree , and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern ;
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like grain blasted before it has grown up .
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah , and said to him , " What did these men say ? from where did they come to you ? " Hezekiah said , " They have come from a far country , even from Babylon . "
I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria , and the plummet of the house of Ahab ; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish , wiping it and turning it upside down .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh . "
" thus says Yahweh , ' Behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
he brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh , outside of Jerusalem , to the brook Kidron , and burned it at the brook Kidron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
as Josiah turned himself , he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain ; and he sent , and took the bones out of the tombs , and burned them on the altar , and defiled it , according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these things .
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
Yahweh said , " I will remove Judah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and I will cast off this city which I have chosen , even Jerusalem , and the house of which I said , ' My name shall be there . ' "
Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .

David went up , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kiriath jearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim , that is called by the Name .
and with them their brothers of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , the doorkeepers .

Shebaniah , and Joshaphat , and Nethanel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew the trumpets before the ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ephod of linen .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , with stringed instruments and with harps ; and Asaph with cymbals , sounding aloud ;

this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
King David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Arammaacah , and out of Zobah .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @-@ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .

David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Yahweh your God ! " all the assembly blessed Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king .
they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh , and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bulls , one thousand rams , and one thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
Huram continued , " Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endowed with discretion and understanding , that should build a house for Yahweh , and a house for his kingdom .
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
he made the most holy house : its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and its breadth twenty cubits ; and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
" Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity , saying , ' We have sinned , we have done perversely , and have dealt wickedly ; '
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the set feasts , three times in the year , in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh , and for the king 's house , and harps and stringed instruments for the singers : and there were none like these seen before in the land of Judah .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
'Thus says Yahweh , " You shall not go up , nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house ; for this thing is of me . " ' " so they listened to the words of Yahweh , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam , and to the princes of Judah , who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , ' You have forsaken me , therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak . ' "
when Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves , the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah , saying , " They have humbled themselves . I will not destroy them ; but I will grant them some deliverance , and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .

then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Yahweh your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him , saying , " Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth . let your word therefore , please be like one of theirs , and speak good . "
and say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace . " ' "
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Jehoshaphat cried out , and Yahweh helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
and he said , " Listen , all Judah , and you inhabitants of Jerusalem , and you king Jehoshaphat . thus says Yahweh to you , ' Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .

when he had taken counsel with the people , he appointed those who should sing to Yahweh , and give praise in holy array , as they went out before the army , and say , Give thanks to Yahweh ; for his loving kindness endures forever .

he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , like the house of Ahab did , and also have slain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
thirty @-@ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years : and he departed without being desired ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Bring her out between the ranks ; and whoever follows her , let him be slain with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don 't kill her in the Yahweh 's house . "
he gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to them , " Go out to the cities of Judah , and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year . see that you expedite this matter . " however the Levites didn 't do it right away .
but the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell on the cities of Judah , from Samaria even to Beth Horon , and struck of them three thousand , and took much spoil .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
he built towers in the wilderness , and dug out many cisterns , for he had much livestock ; in the lowland also , and in the plain : and he had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields ; for he loved farming .
moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men , who went out to war by bands , according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king 's captains .
Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a leper . " Jotham his son reigned in his place .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war ,
Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh ; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh 's temple into the court of the house of Yahweh . the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
he set the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals , with stringed instruments , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king 's seer , and Nathan the prophet ; for the commandment was of Yahweh by his prophets .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh . so they ate throughout the feast for the seven days , offering sacrifices of peace offerings , and making confession to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
the children of Israel and Judah , who lived in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep , and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God , and laid them by heaps .
besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males , from three years old and upward , even everyone who entered into the house of Yahweh , as the duty of every day required , for their service in their offices according to their divisions ;
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? "
doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
hasn 't the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , ' You shall worship before one altar , and on it you shall burn incense ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down ; and he reared up altars for the Baals , and made Asheroth , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Asherim , and the engraved images , and the molten images .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of Yahweh his God .
so Hilkiah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Yahweh , ' Behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
his princes gave for a freewill offering to the people , to the priests , and to the Levites . Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , the rulers of God 's house , gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock , and three hundred head of cattle .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yahweh , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
" thus says Cyrus king of Persia , ' Yahweh , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the builders laid the foundation of Yahweh 's temple , they set the priests in their clothing with trumpets , with the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals , to praise Yahweh , according to the directions of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
then Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions , the Dinaites , and the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanchites , the Dehaites , the Elamites ,
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
now the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them .
the elders of the Jews built and prospered , through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo . they built and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the decree of Cyrus , and Darius , and Artaxerxes king of Persia .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy : for Yahweh had made them joyful , and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them , to strengthen their hands in the work of God 's house , the God of Israel .
this Ezra went up from Babylon : and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses , which Yahweh , the God of Israel , had given ; and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of Yahweh his God on him .
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls , rams , lambs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , who were teachers .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass . "
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
it happened in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shouldn 't my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tombs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
I said to the king , " If it pleases the king , and if your servant has found favor in your sight , that you would send me to Judah , to the city of my fathers ' tombs , that I may build it . "
the king said to me ( the queen was also sitting by him ) , " For how long shall your journey be ? and when will you return ? " so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
the rulers didn 't know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
then I said to them , " You see the evil case that we are in , how Jerusalem lies waste , and its gates are burned with fire . come , let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we won 't be disgraced . "
I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me , as also of the king 's words that he had spoken to me . they said , " Let 's rise up and build . " so they strengthened their hands for the good work .
then answered I them , and said to them , " The God of heaven will prosper us . therefore we , his servants , will arise and build ; but you have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem . "
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it , to the tower of Hananel .
next to them , Meremoth the son of Uriah , the son of Hakkoz made repairs . next to them , Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabel made repairs . next to them , Zadok the son of Baana made repairs .
now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , " What they are building , if a fox climbed up it , he would break down their stone wall . "
but it happened that when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabians , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
I said to the nobles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
please restore to them , even this day , their fields , their vineyards , their olive groves , and their houses , also the hundredth part of the money , and of the grain , the new wine , and the oil , that you are charging them . "
then they said , " We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do , even as you say . " then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they would do according to this promise .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can 't come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Judah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
" remember , my God , Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works , and also the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear . "
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday , in the presence of the men and the women , and of those who could understand ; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law .
and Ezra blessed Yahweh , the great God . all the people answered , " Amen , Amen , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground .

and found his heart faithful before you , and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite , and the Girgashite , to give it to his seed , and have performed your words ; for you are righteous .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples , which you allotted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
" so the children went in and possessed the land , and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gave them into their hands , with their kings , and the peoples of the land , that they might do with them as they pleased .
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem ; but in the cities of Judah everyone lived in his possession in their cities : Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @-@ two ; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashhur , the son of Malchijah ,

the overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Mica , of the sons of Asaph , the singers , over the business of God 's house .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest the scribe .
then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate ;
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the Sabbath day . remember to me , my God , this also , and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcass , the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king ,
Memucan answered before the king and the princes , " Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the princes , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she didn 't come . '
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Esther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
if I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king has said . "
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
the king said , " What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this ? " then the king 's servants who attended him said , " Nothing has been done for him . "
the king said , " Who is in the court ? " now Haman had come into the outer court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
then the king said to Haman , " Hurry and take the clothing and the horse , as you have said , and do this for Mordecai the Jew , who sits at the king 's gate . let nothing fail of all that you have spoken . "
then Haman took the clothing and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai , and had him ride through the city square , and proclaimed before him , " Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ! "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a robe of fine linen and purple ; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad .
but the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month ; and on the fifteenth day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
therefore they called these days " Purim , " from the word " Pur . " therefore because of all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and that which had come to them ,
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai , to which the king advanced him , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
haven 't you made a hedge around him , and around his house , and around all that he has , on every side ? you have blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
while he was still speaking , there also came another , and said , " The fire of God has fallen from the sky , and has burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " The Chaldeans made three bands , and swept down on the camels , and have taken them away , yes , and killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
he said , " Naked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Yahweh gave , and Yahweh has taken away . blessed be the name of Yahweh . "
but he said to her , " You speak as one of the foolish women would speak . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? " in all this Job didn 't sin with his lips .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .

if you say , " Behold , we didn 't know this " ; doesn 't he who weighs the hearts consider it ? he who keeps your soul , doesn 't he know it ? shall he not render to every man according to his work ?
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
then I commended mirth , because a man has no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be joyful : for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun .
for man also doesn 't know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .

therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , the Mighty One of Israel , says : " Ah , I will get relief from my adversaries , and avenge myself of my enemies ;
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
in that day , men shall cast away their idols of silver , and their idols of gold , which have been made for themselves to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
as for my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them . my people , those who lead you cause you to err , and destroy the way of your paths .
Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people , and their leaders : " it is you who have eaten up the vineyard . the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
for the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
their roaring will be like a lioness . they will roar like young lions . yes , they shall roar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
then I said , " Woe is me ! for I am undone , because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for my eyes have seen the King , Yahweh of Armies ! "
it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
then Yahweh said to Isaiah , " Go out now to meet Ahaz , you , and Shearjashub your son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool , on the highway of the fuller 's field .
tell him , ' Be careful , and keep calm . Don 't be afraid , neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches , for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
it will sweep onward into Judah . it will overflow and pass through ; it will reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land , Immanuel .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his shoulders . his name will be called Wonderful , Counselor , Mighty God , Everlasting Father , Prince of Peace .

for he has said , " By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom ; for I have understanding : and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples , and have robbed their treasures . like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers .
it will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , says " My people who dwell in Zion , don 't be afraid of the Assyrian , though he strike you with the rod , and lift up his staff against you , as Egypt did .
Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him , as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb . his rod will be over the sea , and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt .
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh 's land for servants and for handmaids . they will take as captives those whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
Don 't rejoice , O Philistia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the serpent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent .
for the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jazer , which wandered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
yet gleanings will be left there , like the shaking of an olive tree , two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough , four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree , " says Yahweh , the God of Israel .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top , which were forsaken from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a desolation .
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebuke them , and they will flee far off , and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whirling dust before the storm .
for Yahweh said to me , " I will be still , and I will see in my dwelling place , like clear heat in sunshine , like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest . "
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors , and he will send them a savior and a defender , and he will deliver them .
Yahweh will be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vow a vow to Yahweh , and will perform it .
he will surely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the chariots of your glory will be , you shame of your lord 's house .
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
" in that day , " says Yahweh of Armies , " the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way . it will be cut down , and fall . the burden that was on it will be cut off , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
Yahweh , you are my God . I will exalt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faithfulness and truth .
he has swallowed up death forever ! the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces . he will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth , for Yahweh has spoken it .

your dead shall live . my dead bodies shall arise . awake and sing , you who dwell in the dust ; for your dew is like the dew of herbs , and the earth will cast forth the dead .

bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
therefore Yahweh will wait , that he may be gracious to you ; and therefore he will be exalted , that he may have mercy on you , for Yahweh is a God of justice . blessed are all those who wait for him .
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when Yahweh stretches out his hand , both he who helps shall stumble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consumed together .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
look at Zion , the city of our appointed festivals . your eyes will see Jerusalem , a quiet habitation , a tent that won 't be removed . its stakes will never be plucked up , nor will any of its cords be broken .

then Eliakim , Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh , " Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , for we understand it ; and don 't speak to us in the Jews ' language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
Don 't listen to Hezekiah , for thus says the king of Assyria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and each of you eat from his vine , and each one from his fig tree , and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern ;
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
Isaiah said to them , " Tell your master , ' Thus says Yahweh , " Don 't be afraid of the words that you have heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
behold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "

the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
in those days was Hezekiah sick and near death . Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
and said , " Remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah , and asked him , " What did these men say ? where did they come from to you ? " Hezekiah said , " They have come from a country far from me , even from Babylon . "
the voice of one saying , " Cry ! " one said , " What shall I cry ? " " all flesh is like grass , and all its glory is like the flower of the field .
he who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot . he seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved .

one will say , ' I am Yahweh 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jacob ; and another will write with his hand ' to Yahweh , ' and honor the name of Israel . "

I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
thus says Yahweh , " In an acceptable time have I answered you , and in a day of salvation have I helped you ; and I will preserve you , and give you for a covenant of the people , to raise up the land , to make them inherit the desolate heritage :

behold , I am against you , you proud one , says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies ; for your day has come , the time that I will visit you .
a sword is on their horses , and on their chariots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
they lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shields : Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Yahweh , the vengeance of his temple .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself , saying , Surely I will fill you with men , as with the canker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
set up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz : appoint a marshal against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the peoples shall labor for vanity , and the nations for the fire ; and they shall be weary .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and pomegranates .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me desolate and faint all the day .
Zion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They hiss and gnash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried to the Lord : wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no respite ; don 't let the apple of your eye cease .
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not pitied .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with fearfulness ; and they shall drink water by measure , and in dismay :
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordinances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
thus shall my anger be accomplished , and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest , and I shall be comforted ; and they shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken in my zeal , when I have accomplished my wrath on them .
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment , to the nations that are around you , when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath , and in wrathful rebukes ; ( I , Yahweh , have spoken it ; )
thus says the Lord Yahweh : strike with your hand , and stamp with your foot , and say , Alas ! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel ; for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your abominations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , do strike .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
mischief shall come on mischief , and rumor shall be on rumor ; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
the king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothed with desolation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled : I will do to them after their way , and according to their own judgments will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , every man with his censer in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up .
then he said to me , Son of man , have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in his rooms of imagery ? for they say , Yahweh doesn 't see us ; Yahweh has forsaken the land .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clothed in linen , who had the writer 's inkhorn by his side .
Yahweh said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst .
the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : whereas I have removed them far off among the nations , and whereas I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
the prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the dark , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , because he shall not see the land with his eyes .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
tell them therefore , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
for I am Yahweh ; I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall be performed ; it shall be no more deferred : for in your days , rebellious house , will I speak the word , and will perform it , says the Lord Yahweh .
so will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows , and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls ! will you hunt the souls of my people , and save souls alive for yourselves ?
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : as the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your vaulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jewels ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a great eagle with great wings and long feathers , full of feathers , which had various colors , came to Lebanon , and took the top of the cedar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me .
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
yet you say , Why doesn 't the son bear the iniquity of the father ? when the son has done that which is lawful and right , and has kept all my statutes , and has done them , he shall surely live .
but it was plucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit : its strong rods were broken off and withered ; the fire consumed them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
while they see for you false visions , while they divine lies to you , to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded , whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
I , Yahweh , have spoken it : it shall happen , and I will do it : I will not go back , neither will I spare , neither will I repent ; according to your ways , and according to your doings , shall they judge you , says the Lord Yahweh .
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their encampments in you , and make their dwellings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
they shall make a spoil of your riches , and make a prey of your merchandise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleasant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters .
they shall take up a lamentation over you , and tell you , How you are destroyed , who were inhabited by seafaring men , the renowned city , who was strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , who caused their terror to be on all who lived there !
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall make you a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
and tell Tyre , you who dwell at the entry of the sea , who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands , thus says the Lord Yahweh : you , Tyre , have said , I am perfect in beauty .
when your wares went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
by the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you with violence , and you have sinned : therefore I have cast you as profane out of the mountain of God ; and I have destroyed you , covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Sidon ; and I will be glorified in the midst of you ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sanctified in her .
for I will send pestilence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
there shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel , nor a hurting thorn of any that are around them , that scorned them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
I will put hooks in your jaws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales ; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales .
thus says Yahweh : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
the cedars in the garden of God could not hide it ; the fir trees were not like its boughs , and the plane trees were not as its branches ; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty .
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
yes , I will make many peoples amazed at you , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you , when I shall brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of your fall .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
as for you , son of man , the children of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another , everyone to his brother , saying , Please come and hear what is the word that comes forth from Yahweh .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don 't do them .
as a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad , so will I seek out my sheep ; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the watercourses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good pasture ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
I will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was desolate , so will I do to you : you shall be desolate , Mount Seir , and all Edom , even all of it ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I don 't do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my holy name , which you have profaned among the nations , where you went .
I will sanctify my great name , which has been profaned among the nations , which you have profaned in their midst ; and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , says the Lord Yahweh , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Yahweh , have built the ruined places , and planted that which was desolate : I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
therefore prophesy , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all ;
and I will turn you around , and put hooks into your jaws , and I will bring you forth , with all your army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed in full armor , a great company with Buckler and shield , all of them handling swords ;
with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hordes , and on the many peoples who are with him , an overflowing shower , and great hailstones , fire , and sulfur .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , the Holy One in Israel .
they shall know that I am Yahweh their God , in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me there .
every lodge was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed .
the windows of it , and its arches , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arches were before them .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok , who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him .
then he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cubits ; and the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
he measured it on the four sides : it had a wall around it , the length five hundred , and the breadth five hundred , to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Yahweh .
Yahweh said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having oversight at the gates of the house , and ministering in the house : they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister to them .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @-@ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
and one lamb of the flock , out of two hundred , from the well @-@ watered pastures of Israel--for a meal offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make atonement for them , says the Lord Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fifteenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
you shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning , the sixth part of an ephah , and the third part of a Hin of oil , to moisten the fine flour ; a meal offering to Yahweh continually by a perpetual ordinance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
the east side , between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead , and the land of Israel , shall be the Jordan ; from the [ north ] border to the east sea you shall measure . this is the east side .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
the five thousand that are left in the breadth , in front of the twenty @-@ five thousand , shall be for common use , for the city , for dwelling and for suburbs ; and the city shall be in its midst .
the remainder in the length , answerable to the holy offering , shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand westward ; and it shall be answerable to the holy offering ; and its increase shall be for food to those who labor in the city .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
I thank you , and praise you , you God of my fathers , who have given me wisdom and might , and have now made known to me what we desired of you ; for you have made known to us the king 's matter .
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen hereafter ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps , the deputies , and the governors , the judges , the treasurers , the counselors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished , and rose up in haste : he spoke and said to his counselors , didn 't we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered the king , True , O king .
then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace : he spoke and said , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , you servants of the Most High God , come forth , and come here . then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
Belshazzar , while he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , might drink from them .
now the wise men , the enchanters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
when he came near to the den to Daniel , he cried with a lamentable voice ; the king spoke and said to Daniel , Daniel , servant of the living God , is your God , whom you serve continually , able to deliver you from the lions ?
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal , which was diverse from all of them , exceedingly terrible , whose teeth were of iron , and its nails of brass ; which devoured , broke in pieces , and stamped the residue with its feet ;

when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .

therefore don 't yield to them , for more than forty men lie in wait for him , who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him . now they are ready , looking for the promise from you . "

but the free gift isn 't like the trespass . for if by the trespass of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God , and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound to the many .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? may it never be ! however , I wouldn 't have known sin , except through the law . for I wouldn 't have known coveting , unless the law had said , " You shall not covet . "
did then that which is good become death to me ? may it never be ! but sin , that it might be shown to be sin , by working death to me through that which is good ; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful .
for what the law couldn 't do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don 't know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can 't be uttered .
for the Scripture says to Pharaoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
Don 't seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " Vengeance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
for it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . every tongue will confess to God . ' "

to the assembly of God which is at Corinth ; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both theirs and ours :
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . but let each man be careful how he builds on it .
now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be puffed up against one another .
or don 't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Don 't be deceived . neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosexuals ,
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
" foods for the belly , and the belly for foods , " but God will bring to nothing both it and them . but the body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .

yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we live through him .
if others partake of this right over you , don 't we yet more ? nevertheless we did not use this right , but we bear all things , that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ .
for if I preach the Good News , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but woe is to me , if I don 't preach the Good News .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
but if one of those who don 't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
for , " He put all things in subjection under his feet . " but when he says , " All things are put in subjection , " it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him .
now I beg you , brothers ( you know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have set themselves to serve the saints ) ,
when I therefore was thus determined , did I show fickleness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be the " Yes , yes " and the " No , no ? "
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " Amen , " to the glory of God through us .
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
but if the service of death , written engraved on stones , came with glory , so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face ; which was passing away :
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
for we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
what agreement has a temple of God with idols ? for you are a temple of the living God . even as God said , " I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people . "
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ;
I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I don 't know , or whether out of the body , I don 't know ; God knows ) , such a one caught up into the third heaven .
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
and when they perceived the grace that was given to me , James and Cephas and John , they who were reputed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , that we should go to the Gentiles , and they to the circumcision .

but now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles , to which you desire to be in bondage all over again ?
for it is written , " Rejoice , you barren who don 't bear . break forth and shout , you that don 't travail . for more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband . "
envyings , murders , drunkenness , orgies , and things like these ; of which I forewarn you , even as I also forewarned you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
it is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you , because I have you in my heart , because , both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News , you all are partakers with me of grace .
only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ , that , whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your state , that you stand firm in one spirit , with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News ;
yes , I beg you also , true yokefellow , help these women , for they labored with me in the Good News , with Clement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
I know how to be humbled , and I know also how to abound . in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in need .
let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels , dwelling in the things which he has not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord forever .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God 's house , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
but if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
for this cause I also suffer these things . yet I am not ashamed , for I know him whom I have believed , and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day .
from now on , there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give to me on that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing .
no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much rather to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
you have put all things in subjection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don 't see all things subjected to him , yet .
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
who doesn 't need , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices daily , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . for he did this once for all , when he offered up himself .
for finding fault with them , he said , " Behold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant , that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
by faith , Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous , God testifying with respect to his gifts ; and through it he , being dead , still speaks .
by faith , Enoch was taken away , so that he wouldn 't see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with godly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead .
they were stoned . they were sawn apart . they were tempted . they were slain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill @-@ treated
listen , my beloved brothers . didn 't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
Don 't speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
behold , we call them blessed who endured . you have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the Lord in the outcome , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he predicted the sufferings of Christ , and the glories that would follow them .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
you husbands , in the same way , live with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor to the woman , as to the weaker vessel , as being also joint heirs of the grace of life ; that your prayers may not be hindered .
if you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement , and despise authority . daring , self @-@ willed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries ;
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world doesn 't know us , because it didn 't know him .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who doesn 't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
having many things to write to you , I don 't want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
for there are certain men who crept in secretly , even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation : ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into indecency , and denying our only Master , God , and Lord , Jesus Christ .
and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . to him who loves us , and washed us from our sins by his blood ;
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
one of the elders said to me , " Don 't weep . behold , the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has overcome ; he who opens the book and its seven seals . "
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @-@ four elders fell down before the Lamb , each one having a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
another came forth , a red horse . to him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another . there was given to him a great sword .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenix of barley for a denarius ! Don 't damage the oil and the wine ! "
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the fourth angel sounded , and one third of the sun was struck , and one third of the moon , and one third of the stars ; so that one third of them would be darkened , and the day wouldn 't shine for one third of it , and the night in the same way .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
and swore by him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , that there will no longer be delay ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
these have the power to shut up the sky , that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy . they have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as wouldn 't worship the image of the beast to be killed .
I saw , and behold , the Lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their foreheads .
they sing a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , those who had been redeemed out of the earth .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sickle , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
they sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , " Great and marvelous are your works , Lord God , the Almighty ! righteous and true are your ways , you King of the nations .
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
however much she glorified herself , and grew wanton , so much give her of torment and mourning . for she says in her heart , ' I sit a queen , and am no widow , and will in no way see mourning . '
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Thus with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived .
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Give praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty thunders , saying , " Hallelujah ! for the Lord our God , the Almighty , reigns !
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
but for the cowardly , unbelieving , sinners , abominable , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls , who were loaded with the seven last plagues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the Lamb 's bride . "
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the Bright and Morning Star . "
and God said , Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . and he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
and the LORD said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that I have made them .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and the LORD smelled a sweet savour ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
and Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou comest unto Zoar .
and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
and he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
and when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
and I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .

and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Peradventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the LORD being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are thine .

and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave it unto Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Beer @-@ sheba .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth : and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of Ephron , which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field , and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
and he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
and I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bare unto him : and I put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a Vail , and covered herself .
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
sojourn in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
and they said , We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee : and we said , Let there be now an oath betwixt us , even betwixt us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed :
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
and these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , Behold , thy brother Esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
and Rebekah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
and he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and , behold , the LORD stood above it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ;
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks : and a great stone was upon the well 's mouth .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Laban all these things .
and it came to pass , that in the morning , behold , it was Leah : and he said to Laban , What is this thou hast done unto me ? did not I serve with thee for Rachel ? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ?
and Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . then Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son 's mandrakes .
and Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son 's mandrakes . and he lay with her that night .
and Laban said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes , tarry : for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . and he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
and the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were grieved , and they were very wroth , because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
these men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
and it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
and these are the sons of Reuel Esau 's son ; duke Nahath , duke Zerah , duke Shammah , duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau 's wife .
and these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau 's wife ; duke Jeush , duke Jaalam , duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
and Baal @-@ Hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pau ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
for , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flocks ; and bring me word again . so he sent him out of the vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first ,
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
and it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
that she called unto the men of her house , and spake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
and he said unto his brethren , My money is restored ; and , lo , it is even in my sack : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to another , What is this that God hath done unto us ?
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews ; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
and when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his steward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
and Judah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord 's servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Judah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as Pharaoh .
and we said unto my lord , We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;
that ye shall say , Thy servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
they said moreover unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath ; the same is Bethlehem .
the Angel which redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of Atad , they said , This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians : Wherefore the name of it was called Abel @-@ mizraim , which is beyond Jordan .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's brink .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and he said , Certainly I will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain .
and God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ?
and the tale of the bricks , which they did make heretofore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
and they said unto them , The LORD look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and thou shalt say unto him , The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the LORD spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , Intreat the LORD , that he may take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth .
and Pharaoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for me .
and Moses said , Behold , I go out from thee , and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , to morrow : but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD .
behold , the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the LORD .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
and Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the LORD 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt .
and the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
and they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the LORD , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
and he cried unto the LORD ; and the LORD shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
and they took their journey from Elim , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
and when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is manna : for they wist not what it was . and Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat .
this is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , Gather of it every man according to his eating , an Omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
see , for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and Moses said , This is the thing which the LORD commandeth , Fill an Omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chide ye with me ? Wherefore do ye tempt the LORD ?
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and Jethro said , Blessed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
and Moses went up unto God , and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled .
and the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul ; and he shall serve him for ever .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye afar off .
and Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the LORD hath said will we do .
and Moses wrote all the words of the LORD , and rose up early in the morning , and builded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the LORD hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Come up to me into the mount , and be there : and I will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments which I have written ; that thou mayest teach them .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the candlestick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side :
and there shall be a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick .

and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : Wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body , or be in a journey afar off , yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
and so it was , when the cloud abode from even unto the morning , and that the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they journeyed : whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up , they journeyed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of Israel abode in their tents , and journeyed not : but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and Moses said unto Hobab , the son of Raguel the Midianite , Moses ' father in law , We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said , I will give it you : come thou with us , and we will do thee good : for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
and the LORD came down in a cloud , and spake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chewed , the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people , and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague .
and the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses , and unto Aaron , and unto Miriam , Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation . and they three came out .
and he said , Hear now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
the LORD is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD , and their sin offering before the LORD , for their ignorance :
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
so they Gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
but if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD .
the censers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar : for they offered them before the LORD , therefore they are hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the LORD ; the plague is begun .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the LORD , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD , I have given to the Levites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus speak unto the Levites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD , even a tenth part of the tithe .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sinned , for we have spoken against the LORD , and against thee ; pray unto the LORD , that he take away the serpents from us . and Moses prayed for the people .
and Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon : for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
and Moab said unto the elders of Midian , Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . and Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time .
and Balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
and they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
and God came unto Balaam at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was zealous for my sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy .
and the sons of Eliab ; Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . this is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the LORD :
and if his father have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment , as the LORD commanded Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even : as the meat offering of the morning , and as the drink offering thereof , thou shalt offer it , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish :
these things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts , beside your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meat offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings .
and they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
and levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
we have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD , what every man hath gotten , of jewels of gold , chains , and bracelets , rings , earrings , and tablets , to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD .
for when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them .
and the LORD 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the LORD , was consumed .
and Moses said unto them , If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan , every man armed to battle , before the LORD , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession :
and Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh @-@ barnea , and shall go on to Hazar @-@ addar , and pass on to Azmon :
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him .
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was anointed with the holy oil .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land CANNOT be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
and when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
this is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
so I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us .
and ye murmured in your tents , and said , Because the LORD hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , through the way of the plain from Elath , and from Ezion @-@ gaber , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon : behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God giveth thee , for ever .
on this side Jordan , in the valley over against Beth @-@ peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote , after they were come forth out of Egypt :
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
and the LORD heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the LORD said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
but as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers ,
but because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein : for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God .
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
understand therefore this day , that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the LORD hath said unto thee .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the LORD said unto me , Arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image .
and I fell down before the LORD , as at the first , forty days and forty nights : I did neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all your sins which ye sinned , in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GOD , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the LORD gave them unto me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and then the LORD 's wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and ye shall overthrow their altars , and break their pillars , and burn their groves with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the LORD thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the Coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they are unclean unto you .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
according to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken , but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously : thou shalt not be afraid of him .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall say unto them , Hear , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
and , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity . and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
when thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands .
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets :
therefore it shall be , when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about , in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the LORD thy God , that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over , that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , a land that floweth with milk and honey ; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image , an abomination unto the LORD , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and putteth it in a secret place . and all the people shall answer and say , Amen .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
and the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
the LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee ,
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the LORD thy God , he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and the LORD said unto Moses , Behold , thy days approach that thou must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge . and Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
but Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
see now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will avenge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be merciful unto his land , and to his people .
get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
and this is the blessing of Judah : and he said , Hear , LORD , the voice of Judah , and bring him unto his people : let his hands be sufficient for him ; and be thou an help to him from his enemies .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
happy art thou , O Israel : who is like unto thee , O people saved by the LORD , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excellency ! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon their high places .
and the LORD said unto him , This is the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto thy seed : I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
for we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you , when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites , that were on the other side Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom ye utterly destroyed .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the LORD , since I have shewed you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father 's house , and give me a true token :
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
and Joshua said unto them , Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel :
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
and he said , Nay ; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come . and Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , What saith my lord unto his servant ?
and Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Beth @-@ Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed Ai .
and the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men : for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim , and smote them in the going down : Wherefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
up , sanctify the people , and say , Sanctify yourselves against to morrow : for thus saith the LORD God of Israel , There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemies , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
and he brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
and Joshua said unto Achan , My son , give , I pray thee , glory to the LORD God of Israel , and make confession unto him ; and tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me .
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of whole stones , over which no man hath lift up any iron : and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD , and sacrificed peace offerings .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God .
and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
so Joshua took all that land , the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of Goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and the valley of the same ;
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon , and all the plain on the east :
and from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east , and unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea on the east , the way to Beth @-@ jeshimoth ; and from the south , under Ashdoth @-@ pisgah :
and reigned in mount Hermon , and in Salcah , and in all Bashan , unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
in the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ Shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ Shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
and they came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying , The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren . therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
and the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En @-@ tappuah .
and the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
but the mountain shall be thine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the outgoings of it shall be thine : for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they be strong .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
but the Levites have no part among you ; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance : and Gad , and Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh , have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them .
and the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Ataroth @-@ adar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth @-@ horon .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ Shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
and the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
and out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Hammoth @-@ DOR with her suburbs , and Kartan with her suburbs ; three cities .
and now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren , as he promised them : therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents , and unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan .
now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
and when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD .
and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the LORD to anger .
and the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the LORD ; but they did not so .
and when the LORD raised them up judges , then the LORD was with the judge , and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them .
namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal @-@ Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan @-@ rishathaim .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
and he said unto them , Follow after me : for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . and they went down after him , and took the Fords of Jordan toward Moab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
and Barak said unto her , If thou wilt go with me , then I will go : but if thou wilt not go with me , then I will not go .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
and Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
and he said unto her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
curse ye Meroz , said the angel of the LORD , curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the LORD , to the help of the LORD against the mighty .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and there came an angel of the LORD , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abi @-@ ezrite : and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
behold , I will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pitched beside the well of Harod : so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gilead . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
and the LORD said unto Gideon , By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
so the people took victuals in their hand , and their trumpets : and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
and the three companies blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal : and they cried , The sword of the LORD , and of Gideon .
and the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the LORD set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @-@ shittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abel @-@ meholah , unto Tabbath .
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
and he went unto his father 's house at Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hearken unto me , ye men of Shechem , that God may hearken unto you .
and the bramble said unto the trees , If in truth ye anoint me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon .
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ; )
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smote them .
and Abimelech , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel : eighteen years , all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
and Gilead 's wife bare him sons ; and his wife 's sons grew up , and they thrust out Jephthah , and said unto him , Thou shalt not inherit in our father 's house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , Therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
and it came to pass at the end of two months , that she returned unto her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she knew no man . and it was a custom in Israel ,
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the LORD delivered them into my hand : Wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead , and fought with Ephraim : and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim , because they said , Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites , and among the Manassites .
and the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites : and it was so , that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said , Let me go over ; that the men of Gilead said unto him , Art thou an Ephraimite ? if he said , Nay ;
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no rasor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
but he said unto me , Behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Though thou detain me , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the LORD . for Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD .
but his wife said unto him , If the LORD were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion .
and Samson said unto them , I will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments :
and she wept before him the seven days , while their feast lasted : and it came to pass on the seventh day , that he told her , because she lay sore upon him : and she told the riddle to the children of her people .
then the Philistines said , Who hath done this ? and they answered , Samson , the son in law of the Timnite , because he had taken his wife , and given her to his companion . and the Philistines came up , and burnt her and her father with fire .
and they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines . and Samson said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and they spake unto him , saying , No ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee . and they bound him with two new cords , and brought him up from the rock .
and he was sore athirst , and called on the LORD , and said , Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
and she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
and she said , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson . and he awoke out of his sleep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he wist not that the LORD was departed from him .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a graven image and a molten image : and they were in the house of Micah .
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish , and said unto their brethren , Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod , and teraphim , and a graven image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
and these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image . then said the priest unto them , What do ye ?
and he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?
and they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : Howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the graven image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
and they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
and he said unto him , We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim ; from thence am I : and I went to Bethlehemjudah , but I am now going to the house of the LORD ; and there is no man that receiveth me to house .
behold , here is my daughter a maiden , and his concubine ; them I will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing .
( and the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even , and asked counsel of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? and the LORD said , Go up against him . )
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of God , and wept , and sat there before the LORD , and fasted that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah .
then they said , Behold , there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah .
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . and a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her HAP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and she said , I pray you , let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and Boaz said unto her , At mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . and she sat beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corn , and she did eat , and was sufficed , and left .
and when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
then went Boaz up to the gate , and sat him down there : and , behold , the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by ; unto whom he said , Ho , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here . and he turned aside , and sat down .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Naomi ; and they called his name Obed : he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim @-@ zophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephrathite :
but Hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the LORD , and there abide for ever .
and when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh : and the child was young .
and the man of thine , whom I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eyes , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and the messenger answered and said , Israel is fled before the Philistines , and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God is taken .
then said they , What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him ? they answered , Five golden emerods , and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the Philistines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and take the ark of the LORD , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which ye return him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
and it came to pass , while the ark abode in Kirjath @-@ jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD .
and they gathered together to Mizpeh , and drew water , and poured it out before the LORD , and fasted on that day , and said there , We have sinned against the LORD . and Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel : but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were smitten before Israel .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
then said Saul to his servant , But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God : what have we ?
and they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make haste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not thy mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine :
and thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal ; and , behold , I will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seven days shalt thou tarry , till I come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt do .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ?
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and the elders of Jabesh said unto him , Give us seven days ' respite , that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel : and then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee .
and when they forgat the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
and Ahiah , the son of Ahitub , I @-@ chabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the LORD 's priest in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled , and the earth quaked : so it was a very great trembling .
and it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said unto the priest , Withdraw thine hand .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishui , and Melchi @-@ Shua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and Saul said unto the Kenites , Go , depart , get you down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them : for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel , when they came up out of Egypt . so the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
then he said , I have sinned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
but the LORD said unto Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for the LORD seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the LORD looketh on the heart .
and it came to pass , when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took an harp , and played with his hand : so Saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
and David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the trench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battle .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the armies of the Philistines , and spake according to the same words : and David heard them .
and David spake to the men that stood by him , saying , What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine , and taketh away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the LORD be with thee .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commune with David secretly , and say , Behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and Saul 's servants spake those words in the ears of David . and David said , seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ?
and Saul said , Thus shall ye say to David , The king desireth not any dowry , but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king 's enemies . but Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
and David said unto Jonathan , Behold , to morrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
then Saul 's anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said unto him , Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother 's nakedness ?
and as soon as the lad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until David exceeded .
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , Hear now , ye Benjamites ; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds ;
then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?
and the king said to Doeg , Turn thou , and fall upon the priests . and Doeg the Edomite turned , and he fell upon the priests , and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod .
will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? O LORD God of Israel , I beseech thee , tell thy servant . and the LORD said , He will come down .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
and David said unto his men , Gird ye on every man his sword . and they girded on every man his sword ; and David also girded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Belial , that a man CANNOT speak to him .
then Abigail made haste , and took two hundred loaves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and an hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on asses .
and it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , brother to Joab , saying , Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? and Abishai said , I will go down with thee .
this thing is not good that thou hast done . as the LORD liveth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the LORD 's anointed . and now see where the king 's spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
and Achish said , whither have ye made a road to day ? and David said , Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites .
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had invaded the south , and Ziklag , and smitten Ziklag , and burned it with fire ;
and David inquired at the LORD , saying , Shall I pursue after this troop ? shall I overtake them ? and he answered him , Pursue : for thou shalt surely overtake them , and without fail recover all .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and it came to pass after this , that David inquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up . and David said , whither shall I go up ? and he said , Unto Hebron .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ Gilead , and said unto them , Blessed be ye of the LORD , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : Wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
and , Behold , the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Abner was not with David in Hebron ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
and Saul 's son had two men that were captains of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin : ( for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin :
and they brought the head of Ish @-@ bosheth unto David to Hebron , and said to the king , Behold the head of Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul , and of his seed .
and David commanded his young men , and they slew them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron . but they took the head of Ish @-@ bosheth , and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron .
and David inquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up to the Philistines ? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto David , Go up : for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
and David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
and they brought in the ark of the LORD , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
and David said unto Michal , It was before the LORD , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD , over Israel : therefore will I play before the LORD .
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel :
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , O Lord GOD , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
of Syria , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , and of Amalek , and of the spoil of Hadadezer , son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
and the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may shew the kindness of God unto him ? and Ziba said unto the king , Jonathan hath yet a son , which is lame on his feet .
and the king said unto him , Where is he ? and Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he is in the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , in Lo @-@ debar .
and when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth @-@ rehob , and the Syrians of Zoba , twenty thousand footmen , and of king Maacah a thousand men , and of Ish @-@ tob twelve thousand men .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city . so Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
and when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
and David said to Uriah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and I gave thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take thy wives before thine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and anointed himself , and changed his apparel , and came into the house of the LORD , and worshipped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he did eat .
and I , whither shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
for we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which CANNOT be gathered up again ; neither doth God respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that his banished be not expelled from him .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
and Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Joab said , To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
and it came to pass after forty years , that Absalom said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed unto the LORD , in Hebron .
and lo Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God : and they set down the ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and the king said unto Zadok , Carry back the ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD , he will bring me again , and shew me both it , and his habitation :
and David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
and one told David , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness .
but if thou return to the city , and say unto Absalom , I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father 's servant hitherto , so will I now also be thy servant : then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel .
and the king said , And where is thy master 's son ? and Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he abideth at Jerusalem : for he said , To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth . and Ziba said , I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
and the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah ? so let him curse , because the LORD hath said unto him , Curse David . who shall then say , Wherefore hast thou done so ?
and it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , was come unto Absalom , that Hushai said unto Absalom , God save the king , God save the king .
and Hushai said unto Absalom , Nay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
and when Absalom 's servants came to the woman to the house , they said , Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? and the woman said unto them , They be gone over the brook of water . and when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , after they were departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David , and said unto David , Arise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you .
and it came to pass , when David was come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo @-@ debar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim ,
and the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
and Joab said unto the man that told him , And , behold , thou sawest him , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground ? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver , and a girdle .
then said Joab , I may not tarry thus with thee . and he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and Joab said unto him , Thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king 's son is dead .
and the watchman said , Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . and the king said , He is a good man , and cometh with good tidings .
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . and they told unto all the people , saying , Behold , the king doth sit in the gate . and all the people came before the king : for Israel had fled every man to his tent .
and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . and Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king , as he was come over Jordan ;
for thy servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , Wherefore wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ?
for all of my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table . what right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and , behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said unto the king , Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away , and have brought the king , and his household , and all David 's men with him , over Jordan ?
and when he was come near unto her , the woman said , Art thou Joab ? and he answered , I am he . then she said unto him , Hear the words of thine handmaid . and he answered , I do hear .
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose . and the king said , I will give them .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bare unto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite :
and there was again a battle in GOB with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaare @-@ oregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
and David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the LORD .
and he said , Be it far from me , O LORD , that I should do this : is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives ? therefore he would not drink it . these things did these three mighty men .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of Kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of Moab : he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .
and they passed over Jordan , and pitched in Aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad , and toward Jazer :
and Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
and David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people , and said , Lo , I have sinned , and I have done wickedly : but these sheep , what have they done ? let thine hand , I pray thee , be against me , and against my father 's house .
and Araunah said , Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant ? and David said , To buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build an altar unto the LORD , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Araunah said unto David , Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood .
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
and while he yet spake , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule :
and it was told Solomon , saying , Behold , Adonijah feareth king Solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword .
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not nay . and the king said unto her , Ask on , my mother : for I will not say thee nay .
and it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
and Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD , and said unto him , Thus saith the king , Come forth . and he said , Nay ; but I will die here . and Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me .
and the king said unto him , Do as he hath said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood , which Joab shed , from me , and from the house of my father .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the LORD .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath . and they told Shimei , saying , Behold , thy servants be in Gath .
and Solomon awoke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and the other woman said , Nay ; but the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . and this said , No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . thus they spake before the king .
then said the king , The one saith , This is my son that liveth , and thy son is the dead : and the other saith , Nay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living .
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
and , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD spake unto David my father , saying , Thy son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar : he even built them for it within , even for the oracle , even for the most holy place .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the basons . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD :
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
and I have set there a place for the ark , wherein is the covenant of the LORD , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , O LORD my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant prayeth before thee to day :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ; )
for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant , when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord GOD .
blessed be the LORD , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
and Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the LORD , two and twenty thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant , and for Israel his people .
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
and this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the LORD , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
and three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD , and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD . so he finished the house .
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel , and his cupbearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as was the heart of David his father .
and they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran : and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
and when hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
then Pharaoh said unto him , But what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ? and he answered , Nothing : Howbeit let me go in any wise .
and it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and he said to Jeroboam , Take thee ten pieces : for thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , Behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah , with the tribe of Benjamin , an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt incense .
now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
and also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook Kidron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had builded ; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
for all the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , by which they sinned , and by which they made Israel to sin , in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
and he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill , Samaria .
in his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho : he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn , and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel , and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the groves four hundred , which eat at Jezebel 's table .
and call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the LORD : and the God that answereth by fire , let him be God . and all the people answered and said , It is well spoken .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
and he said , I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts : for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and Ahab said , By whom ? and he said , Thus saith the LORD , Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces . then he said , Who shall order the battle ? and he answered , Thou .
and the prophet came to the king of Israel , and said unto him , Go , strengthen thy self , and mark , and see what thou doest : for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee .
then said he unto him , Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD , behold , as soon as thou art departed from me , a lion shall slay thee . and as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and slew him .
and he said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for his life , and thy people for his people .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , Surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the ivory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and there came down fire from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
and Elijah said unto Elisha , Tarry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel . and Elisha said unto him , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . so they went down to Bethel .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he said , Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Elisha , tarry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho . and he said , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . so they came to Jericho .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he answered , Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Tarry , I pray thee , here ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan . and he said , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . and they two went on .
and it came to pass , when they were gone over , that Elijah said unto Elisha , Ask what I shall do for thee , before I be taken away from thee . and Elisha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
and Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
but Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD , that we may inquire of the LORD by him ? and one of the king of Israel 's servants answered and said , Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat , which poured water on the hands of Elijah .
for thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
and Gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . Wherefore he went again to meet him , and told him , saying , The child is not awaked .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
and Elisha came again to Gilgal : and there was a dearth in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets .
and the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
and it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
but Naaman was wroth , and went away , and said , Behold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the leper .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
and the man of God said , Where fell it ? and he shewed him the place . and he cut down a stick , and cast it in thither ; and the iron did swim .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . and his servant said unto him , Alas , my master ! how shall we do ?
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Behold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who spake when the king came down to him .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that he took a thick cloth , and dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Hazael reigned in his stead .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the LORD .
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the LORD , at the hand of Jezebel .
and he said , Throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
Wherefore they came again , and told him . and he said , This is the word of the LORD , which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel :
and there came a messenger , and told him , saying , They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . and he said , Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Ye be righteous : behold , I conspired against my master , and slew him : but who slew all these ?
and the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the captains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the LORD , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD , and shewed them the king 's son .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and he brought forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , God save the king .
then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD :
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died . and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof .
and Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael the cities , which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war . three times did Joash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
thou hast indeed smitten Edom , and thine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tarry at home : for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
and Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth @-@ Shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and the LORD smote the king , so that he was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house . and Jotham the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
this was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu , saying , Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
and Menahem exacted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . so the king of Assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Pharoah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the groves , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan .
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebna , and Joah , unto Rab @-@ shakeh , Speak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the Jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :
hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern :
then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rab @-@ shakeh .
and he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
and they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say to your master , Thus saith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
now therefore , O LORD our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God , even thou only .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . and he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
and as Josiah turned himself , he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount , and sent , and took the bones out of the sepulchres , and burned them upon the altar , and polluted it , according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
surely there was not Holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
and the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
and he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits , and the chapiter upon it was brass : and the height of the chapiter three cubits ; and the wreathen work , and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about , all of brass : and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah .
now the sons of Keturah , Abraham 's concubine : she bare Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah . and the sons of Jokshan ; Sheba , and Dedan .
and when Baal @-@ Hanan was dead , hadad reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pai ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
and he took Geshur , and Aram , with the towns of Jair , from them , with Kenath , and the towns thereof , even threescore cities . all these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead .
and their brethren of the house of their fathers were , Michael , and Meshullam , and Sheba , and Jorai , and Jachan , and Zia , and Heber , seven .
and to the sons of Gershom throughout their families out of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
all these were the children of Asher , heads of their father 's house , choice and mighty men of valour , chief of the princes . and the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
and the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour , archers , and had many sons , and sons ' sons , an hundred and fifty . all these are of the sons of Benjamin .
and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pashur , the son of Malchijah , and Maasiai the son of Adiel , the son of Jahzerah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Meshillemith , the son of Immer ;
and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of Asa , the son of Elkanah , that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the LORD thy God said unto thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
he was with David at Pas @-@ dammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where was a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
and the three brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the LORD ,
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts ; he slew two lionlike men of Moab : also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day .
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh .
and of the children of Issachar , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and David went up , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kirjath @-@ jearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD , that dwelleth between the cherubims , whose name is called on it .
and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
and with them their brethren of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , the porters .
and Shebaniah , and Jehoshaphat , and Nethaneel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites that bare the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ephod of linen .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
Asaph the chief , and next to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom : and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps ; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals ;
to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD , which he commanded Israel ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the LORD , because his mercy endureth for ever ;
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
them also king David dedicated unto the LORD , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with saws , and with harrows of iron , and with axes . even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon . and David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
and David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people , Go , number Israel from Beer @-@ sheba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
and Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword .
and David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
then David said to Ornan , Grant me the place of this threshingfloor , that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD : thou shalt grant it me for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Ornan said unto David , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes : lo , I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; I give it all .
behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days .
is not the LORD your God with you ? and hath he not given you rest on every side ? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand ; and the land is subdued before the LORD , and before his people .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths , in the new moons , and on the set feasts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the LORD :
of Jeduthun : the sons of Jeduthun ; Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun , who prophesied with a harp , to give thanks and to praise the LORD .
and all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated ; and whosoever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shelomith , and of his brethren .
and of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brethren , men of valour , a thousand and seven hundred , were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD , and in the service of the king .
and over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah :
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every candlestick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the candlesticks of silver by weight , both for the candlestick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every candlestick .
thine , O LORD , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the LORD , and the king .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD , on the morrow after that day , even a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
Huram said moreover , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endued with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
and he made the most holy house , the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits : and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon thy land , which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance .
and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the LORD upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement , and worshipped , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
and the LORD appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sanctified for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations .
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
and Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us ?
thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam , and to the princes of Judah , that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said unto them , Thus saith the LORD , Ye have forsaken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak .
and when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah , saying , They have humbled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet , and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ? and there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden calves , which Jeroboam made you for gods .
and Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
and at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the LORD thy God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , Shall we go to Ramoth @-@ Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? and they said , Go up ; for God will deliver it into the king 's hand .
and the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him , saying , Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent ; let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good .
and the LORD said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ Gilead ? and one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the LORD helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and said , O LORD God of our fathers , art not thou God in heaven ? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen ? and in thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
and he said , hearken ye , all Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou king Jehoshaphat , Thus saith the LORD unto you , Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
and when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the LORD , and that should praise the beauty of holiness , as they went out before the army , and to say , Praise the LORD ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring , like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab , and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than thyself :
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . Howbeit they buried him in the city of David , but not in the sepulchres of the kings .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , Behold , the king 's son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
but let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , God save the king .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
but the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Judah , from Samaria even unto Beth @-@ horon , and smote three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ?
then Amaziah king of Judah took advice , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us see one another in the face .
thou sayest , Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed @-@ Edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
and he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and brake down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod , and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king 's captains .
and Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon him , and , behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence ; yea , himself hasted also to go out , because the LORD had smitten him .
and Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a leper : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
and said unto them , Hear me , ye Levites , sanctify now yourselves , and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD , and turned their backs .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king , and said , We have cleansed all the house of the LORD , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread table , with all the vessels thereof .
and they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for Judah . and he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD .
and he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals , with psalteries , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king 's seer , and Nathan the prophet : for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets .
now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the LORD , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the LORD your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
and Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers .
and all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
and concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God , and laid them by heaps .
and next him were Eden , and Miniamin , and Jeshua , and Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small :
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and when he had broken down the altars and the groves , and had beaten the graven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the LORD his God .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah :
behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
and his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Levites : Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle , and three hundred oxen .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the LORD , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the oxen .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , with all them whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren the priests , and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and his brethren , and builded the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings thereon , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD , they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets , and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals , to praise the LORD , after the ordinance of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
then wrote Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions ; the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Susanchites , the Dehavites , and the Elamites ,
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
at the same time came to them Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and their companions , and said thus unto them , Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
this Ezra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses , which the LORD God of Israel had given : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of Ahava , that we might afflict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the LORD .
then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
now when Ezra had prayed , and when he had confessed , weeping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people wept very sore .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
and the king said unto me , ( the queen also sitting by him , ) For how long shall thy journey be ? and when wilt thou return ? so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
then said I unto them , Ye see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they builded the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it , unto the tower of Hananeel .
and next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . and next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . and next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
but the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Beth @-@ haccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
then said they , We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do as thou sayest . then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , beside forty shekels of silver ; yea , even their servants bare rule over the people : but so did not I , because of the fear of God .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Judah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and Ezra blessed the LORD , the great God . and all the people answered , Amen , Amen , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Sihon , and the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
and the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem : but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities , to wit , Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashur , the son of Malchiah ,
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
the overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micha . of the sons of Asaph , the singers were over the business of the house of God .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath @-@ arba , and in the villages thereof , and at Dibon , and in the villages thereof , and at Jekabzeel , and in the villages thereof ,
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
and I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath day . remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven Chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king ,
and Memucan answered before the king and the princes , Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's Chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's Chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
and the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
if I have found favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
then the king said to Haman , Make haste , and take the apparel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to Mordecai the Jew , that sitteth at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken .
then took Haman the apparel and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai , and brought him on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
and the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , queen Esther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
for we are sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be slain , and to perish . but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen , I had held my tongue , although the enemy could not countervail the king 's damage .
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
and Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
and Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a garment of fine linen and purple : and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad .
therefore the Jews of the villages , that dwelt in the unwalled towns , made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , whereunto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The fire of God is fallen from heaven , and hath burned up the sheep , and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The Chaldeans made out three bands , and fell upon the camels , and have carried them away , yea , and slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
and , behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and smote the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
and said , Naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thither : the LORD gave , and the LORD hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the LORD .
but he said unto her , Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? in all this did not Job sin with his lips .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
they are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let them say continually , Let the LORD be magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
rebuke the company of spearmen , the multitude of the bulls , with the calves of the people , till every one submit himself with pieces of silver : scatter thou the people that delight in war .
if thou sayest , Behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
thine own friend , and thy father 's friend , forsake not ; neither go into thy brother 's house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
who hath ascended up into heaven , or descended ? who hath gathered the wind in his fists ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? what is his name , and what is his son 's name , if thou canst tell ?
I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how Dieth the wise man ? as the fool .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
so I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it .
then I commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry : for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God giveth him under the sun .
for man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of Amana , from the top of Shenir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , I CANNOT away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
as for my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them . O my people , they which lead thee cause thee to err , and destroy the way of thy paths .
the LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people , and the princes thereof : for ye have eaten up the vineyard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
and the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the LORD , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
then said I , Woe is me ! for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the LORD of hosts .
and it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is confederate with Ephraim . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
then said the LORD unto Isaiah , Go forth now to meet Ahaz , thou , and Shear @-@ jashub thy son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field ;
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria .
and he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel .
for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Wonderful , Counseller , The mighty God , The everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
Wherefore it shall come to pass , that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria , and the glory of his high looks .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts , O my people that dwellest in Zion , be not afraid of the Assyrian : he shall smite thee with a rod , and shall lift up his staff against thee , after the manner of Egypt .
and the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb : and as his rod was upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab ; and the children of Ammon shall obey them .
and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from Assyria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
behold , the day of the LORD cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
and the people shall take them , and bring them to their place : and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids : and they shall take them captives , whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve ,
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming : it stirreth up the dead for thee , even all the chief ones of the earth ; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations .
for thou hast said in thine heart , I will ascend into heaven , I will exalt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north :
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch , and as the raiment of those that are slain , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stones of the pit ; as a carcase trodden under feet .
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall slay thy remnant .
the burden of Moab . because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
we have heard of the pride of Moab ; he is very proud : even of his haughtiness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
but now the LORD hath spoken , saying , Within three years , as the years of an hireling , and the glory of Moab shall be contemned , with all that great multitude ; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble .
the fortress also shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , saith the LORD of hosts .
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn , and reapeth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim .
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
and behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains ; and when he bloweth a trumpet , hear ye .
the burden of Egypt . behold , the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , saith the Lord , the LORD of hosts .
surely the princes of Zoan are fools , the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish : how say ye unto Pharaoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
and the LORD shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the LORD , and perform it .
therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
and , behold , here cometh a chariot of men , with a couple of horsemen . and he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock ?
and I will clothe him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy girdle , and I will commit thy government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
in that day , saith the LORD of hosts , shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the LORD hath spoken it .
behold the land of the Chaldeans ; this people was not , till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof ; and he brought it to ruin .
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
for thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the needy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall .
and in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
and it shall be said in that day , Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the LORD ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the LORD .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
and your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
and thou shalt be brought down , and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be , as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver , and the ornament of thy molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven days , in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people , and healeth the stroke of their wound .
and his breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the LORD shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
for Tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the LORD shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
because the palaces shall be forsaken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ;
look upon Zion , the city of our solemnities : thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation , a tabernacle that shall not be taken down ; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed , neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hearken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
and the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army . and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh , Speak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern ;

and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Maaseiah , in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase , before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the Great , the Mighty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
and the Chaldeans , that fight against this city , shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the houses , upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods , to provoke me to anger .
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the LORD .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and now therefore thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning this city , whereof ye say , It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
they come to fight with the Chaldeans , but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city .
then will I cast away the seed of Jacob , and David my servant , so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will cause their captivity to return , and have mercy on them .
thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
that every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a Jew his brother .
thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
and Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
behold , I will command , saith the LORD , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant .
but it came to pass , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spake unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the LORD 's house , in the ears of all the people .
so the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elishama the scribe 's chamber . and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
and it came to pass , that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
and I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity ; and I will bring upon them , and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and upon the men of Judah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them ; but they hearkened not .
thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me ; Behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
and when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he took Jeremiah the prophet , saying , Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the LORD ? and Jeremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Jeremiah sunk in the mire .
now when Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuchs which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
so Ebed @-@ melech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD : and the king said unto Jeremiah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
so Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah , saying , As the LORD liveth , that made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the LORD , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD , after that Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
and Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men , saying , Fear not to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah .
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , and upon all the cities of Judah ; and , behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein ,
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven , and poured out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her , without our men ?
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah , and all the remnant of Judah , that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or theirs .
the word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
thus shalt thou say unto him , The LORD saith thus ; Behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pluck up , even this whole land .
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the LORD .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
he made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , Arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saith ; Behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Pharaoh , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the LORD .
thus saith the LORD ; Behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines , and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth : for the LORD will spoil the Philistines , the remnant of the country of Caphtor .
there shall be no more praise of Moab : in Heshbon they have devised evil against it ; come , and let us cut it off from being a nation . also thou shalt be cut down , O madmen ; the sword shall pursue thee .

thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jazer : the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage .
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon it , even upon Moab , the year of their visitation , saith the LORD .
howl , O Heshbon , for Ai is spoiled : cry , ye daughters of Rabbah , gird you with sackcloth ; lament , and run to and fro by the hedges ; for their king shall go into captivity , and his priests and his princes together .
for I have sworn by myself , saith the LORD , that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
for I will cause ELAM to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger , saith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them :
declare ye among the nations , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , Babylon is taken , Bel is confounded , Merodach is broken in pieces ; her idols are confounded , her images are broken in pieces .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
in those days , and in that time , saith the LORD , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , saith the Lord GOD of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
for Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the LORD 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reacheth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shields : the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the LORD , the vengeance of his temple .
set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watchmen , prepare the ambushes : for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , saith the LORD , which destroyest all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashchenaz ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
and I will make drunk her princes , and her wise men , her captains , and her rulers , and her mighty men : and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ Adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD , the Chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
and the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
and a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .

how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion : he poured out his fury like fire .
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they hiss and gnash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
and under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with astonishment :
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comforted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Smite with thine hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
so will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath , in all their habitations : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancients .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
then said he unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , The LORD seeth us not ; the LORD hath forsaken the earth .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer 's inkhorn by his side ;
and it came to pass , while they were slaying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GOD ! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
then said he unto me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perverseness : for they say , The LORD hath forsaken the earth , and the LORD seeth not .
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the LORD ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord GOD .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
tell them therefore , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
for I am the LORD : I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in your days , O rebellious house , will I say the word , and will perform it , saith the Lord GOD .
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and of thy garments thou didst take , and deckedst thy high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
behold , therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee , and have diminished thine ordinary food , and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the Philistines , which are ashamed of thy lewd way .
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; A great eagle with great wings , longwinged , full of feathers , which had divers colours , came unto Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the cedar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
say now to the rebellious house , Know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , Behold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it : and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
yet say ye , Why ? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
but she was plucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Are ye come to inquire of me ? as I live , saith the Lord GOD , I will not be inquired of by you .
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O ye house of Israel , saith the Lord GOD .
and say to the land of Israel , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon thy thigh .
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I recompensed upon their heads , saith the Lord GOD .
girded with girdles upon their loins , exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea , the land of their nativity :
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that whereupon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword .
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses : and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the LORD have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
and they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and say to thee , How art thou destroyed , that wast inhabited of seafaring men , the renowned city , which wast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it !
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
and say unto Tyrus , O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many isles , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; O Tyrus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
for I will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel , nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them , that despised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
but I will put hooks in thy jaws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
behold , therefore I am against thee , and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance , when they shall look after them : but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
thus saith the LORD ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord GOD .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
the cedars in the garden of God could not hide him : the fir trees were not like his boughs , and the chestnut trees were not like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
yea , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee , when I shall brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her : the daughters of the nations shall lament her : they shall lament for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , saith the Lord GOD .
there is Meshech , tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten .
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was desolate , so will I do unto thee : thou shalt be desolate , O mount Seir , and all Idumea , even all of it : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , saith the Lord GOD .
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
and I will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the heathen , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD , saith the Lord GOD , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen , whither they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore .
and I will turn thee back , and put hooks into thy jaws , and I will bring thee forth , and all thine army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed with all sorts of armour , even a great company with bucklers and shields , all of them handling swords :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord GOD , that my fury shall come up in my face .
and I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an overflowing rain , and great hailstones , fire , and brimstone .
so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more : and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD , the Holy One in Israel .
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me , and brought me thither .
and he brought me thither , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , which come near to the LORD to minister unto him .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
and the breadth of the door was ten cubits ; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side , and five cubits on the other side : and he measured the length thereof , forty cubits : and the breadth , twenty cubits .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , saith the Lord GOD .
then said the LORD unto me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the LORD , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD : and I fell upon my face .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house , and ministering to the house : they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the oblation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
and one lamb out of the flock , out of two hundred , out of the fat pastures of Israel ; for a meat offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make reconciliation for them , saith the Lord GOD .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
and the east side ye shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
and the five thousand , that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a profane place for the city , for dwelling , and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst thereof .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates northward ; one gate of Reuben , one gate of Judah , one gate of Levi .
but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
the king answered and said to the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king 's matter .
as for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellers , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied , and rose up in haste , and spake , and said unto his counsellers , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
he answered and said , Lo , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
Belshazzar , whiles he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , might drink therein .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , drank in them .
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thyself , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
and when he came to the den , he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel : and the king spake and said to Daniel , O Daniel , servant of the living God , is thy God , whom thou servest continually , able to deliver thee from the lions ?
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
and behold another beast , a second , like to a bear , and it raised up itself on one side , and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it : and they said thus unto it , Arise , devour much flesh .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
and there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and his nails of brass ; which devoured , brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with his feet ;
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
and he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of ELAM ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
yea , all Israel have transgressed thy law , even by departing , that they might not obey thy voice ; therefore the curse is poured upon us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God , because we have sinned against him .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he spake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel , whose name was called Belteshazzar ; and the thing was true , but the time appointed was long : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
but his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stirred up , even to his fortress .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
the word of the LORD that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
the beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea . and the LORD said to Hosea , Go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms : for the land hath committed great whoredom , departing from the LORD .
and the LORD said unto him , Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel .
and she conceived again , and bare a daughter . and God said unto him , Call her name Lo @-@ ruhamah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
for their mother hath played the harlot : she that conceived them hath done shamefully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the LORD .
and I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
and I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Thou art my people ; and they shall say , Thou art my God .
and I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills , under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and your spouses shall commit adultery .
hear ye this , O priests ; and hearken , ye house of Israel ; and give ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a snare on Mizpah , and a net spread upon Tabor .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their congregation hath heard .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
the days of visitation are come , the days of recompence are come ; Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred .
the high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , Cover us ; and to the hills , Fall on us .
and Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught , and loveth to tread out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make Ephraim to ride ; Judah shall plow , and Jacob shall break his clods .

sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God , and cry unto the LORD ,
blow ye the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land tremble : for the day of the LORD cometh , for it is nigh at hand ;
and the LORD shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
gather the people , sanctify the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts : let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
yea , the LORD will answer and say unto his people , Behold , I will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith : and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen :
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered : for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance , as the LORD hath said , and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call .
yea , and what have ye to do with me , O Tyre , and Zidon , and all the coasts of Palestine ? will ye render me a recompence ? and if ye recompence me , swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head ;
the LORD also shall roar out of Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the LORD will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
and he said , The LORD will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of Carmel shall wither .
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to Edom :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Tyrus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly covenant :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Moab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
publish in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria , and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
for , lo , he that formeth the mountains , and createth the wind , and declareth unto man what is his thought , that maketh the morning darkness , and treadeth upon the high places of the earth , The LORD , The God of hosts , is his name .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
and the LORD said unto me , Amos , what seest thou ? and I said , A plumbline . then said the Lord , Behold , I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more :
and he said , Amos , what seest thou ? and I said , A basket of summer fruit . then said the LORD unto me , The end is come upon my people of Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , saith the Lord GOD : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord GOD , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD :
they that swear by the sin of Samaria , and say , Thy god , O Dan , liveth ; and , The manner of Beer @-@ sheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent , and he shall bite them :
and the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mourn : and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
and I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
the vision of Obadiah . thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom ; We have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen , Arise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle .
thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
but Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD , and went down to Joppa ; and he found a ship going to Tarshish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD .
then the mariners were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea , to lighten it of them . but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep .
and they said every one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
then said they unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ; What is thine occupation ? and whence comest thou ? what is thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
and the LORD God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
and it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that God prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah , that he fainted , and wished in himself to die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
for the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the transgression of Jacob ? is it not Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? are they not Jerusalem ?
pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Saphir , having thy shame naked : the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @-@ ezel ; he shall receive of you his standing .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the LORD , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
and the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD , as the showers upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sons of men .
for the statutes of Omri are kept , and all the works of the house of Ahab , and ye walk in their counsels ; that I should make thee a desolation , and the inhabitants thereof an hissing : therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people .

God is jealous , and the LORD revengeth ; the LORD revengeth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth wrath for his enemies .

but to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
after the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
but by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
for our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you @-@ ward .
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
but if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
for though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
but I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I CANNOT tell ; or whether out of the body , I CANNOT tell : God knoweth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
for though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
I told you before , and foretell you , as if I were present , the second time ; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned , and to all other , that , if I come again , I will not spare :
and when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
and this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , CANNOT disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
but I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
for by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; whereof I Paul am made a minister ;
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
but even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
but if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
for unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? and again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
by faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
if ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
( for the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
for there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
but I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
but unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
and they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
and the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Give me the little book . and he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were redeemed from the earth .
saying with a loud voice , Fear God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
and the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
and they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and wailing , saying , Alas , alas , that great city , wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is she made desolate .

and I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
but the fearful , and unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death .
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
in the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
