God called the light " day , " and the darkness he called " night . " there was evening and there was morning , one day .
God said , " Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters . "
God called the dry land " earth , " and the gathering together of the waters he called " seas . " God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the earth yield grass , herbs yielding seed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with its seed in it , on the earth " ; and it was so .
God said , " Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days and years ;
and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth " ; and it was so .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky . "
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
and the gold of that land is good . there is aromatic resin and the onyx stone .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "

Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man , and he slept ; and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
he made the rib , which Yahweh God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
the man said , " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . she will be called ' woman , ' because she was taken out of Man . "
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made . he said to the woman , " Has God really said , ' You shall not eat of any tree of the garden ? ' "
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
the man said , " I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself . "
Yahweh God said to the woman , " What is this you have done ? " the woman said , " The serpent deceived me , and I ate . "
to the woman he said , " I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth . in pain you will bear children . your desire will be for your husband , and he will rule over you . "
it will yield thorns and thistles to you ; and you will eat the herb of the field .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
again she gave birth , to Cain 's brother Abel . Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don 't do well , sin crouches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
Yahweh said to Cain , " Where is Abel , your brother ? " he said , " I don 't know . am I my brother 's keeper ? "
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
Zillah also gave birth to tubal Cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron . tubal Cain 's sister was Naamah .

make a ship of gopher wood . you shall make rooms in the ship , and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch .
take with you of all food that is eaten , and gather it to yourself ; and it will be for food for you , and for them . "
you shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you , the male and his female . of the animals that are not clean , take two , the male and his female .
also of the birds of the sky , seven and seven , male and female , to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
he sent out a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground ,
the dove came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
" go out of the ship , you , and your wife , and your sons , and your sons ' wives with you .
while the earth remains , seed time and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease . "
" as for me , behold , I establish my covenant with you , and with your offspring after you ,
I set my rainbow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth .
it will happen , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud ,
the rainbow will be in the cloud . I will look at it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . "
God said to Noah , " This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth . "
Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they didn 't see their father 's nakedness .
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as you go toward Gerar , to Gaza ; as you go toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , to Lasha .
to Eber were born two sons . the name of the one was Peleg , for in his days the earth was divided . his brother 's name was Joktan .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations . of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
they said one to another , " Come , let 's make bricks , and burn them thoroughly . " they had brick for stone , and they used tar for mortar .
Yahweh said , " Behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be withheld from them , which they intend to do .
so Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Babel , because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth . from there , Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
Abram and Nahor took wives . the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah .
now Yahweh said to Abram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
Yahweh appeared to Abram and said , " I will give this land to your seed . " he built an altar there to Yahweh , who appeared to him .
there was a famine in the land . Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
please say that you are my sister , that it may be well with me for your sake , and that my soul may live because of you . "
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Abram called on the name of Yahweh .
there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .
Abram lived in the land of Canaan , and Lot lived in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as Sodom .
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
it happened in the days of Amraphel , king of Shinar , Arioch , king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer , king of ELAM , and Tidal , king of Goiim ,
that they made war with Bera , king of Sodom , and with Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , and Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) .
all these joined together in the valley of Siddim ( the same is the Salt Sea ) .
they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their food , and went their way .
the king of Sodom said to Abram , " Give me the people , and take the goods to yourself . "
Abram said to the king of Sodom , " I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh , God Most High , possessor of heaven and earth ,
that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours , lest you should say , ' I have made Abram rich . '
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men who went with me : Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . let them take their portion . "
after these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision , saying , " Don 't be afraid , Abram . I am your shield , your exceedingly great reward . "
Abram said , " Lord Yahweh , what will you give me , since I go childless , and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus ? "
Abram said , " Behold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
he said to him , " I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give you this land to inherit it . "
he said to Abram , " Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs , and will serve them . they will afflict them four hundred years .
in the fourth generation they will come here again , for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full . "
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
in that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram , saying , " To your seed I have given this land , from the river of Egypt to the great river , the river Euphrates :
now Sarai , Abram 's wife , bore him no children . she had a handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
but Abram said to Sarai , " Behold , your maid is in your hand . do to her whatever is good in your eyes . " Sarai dealt harshly with her , and she fled from her face .
the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
he said , " Hagar , Sarai 's handmaid , where did you come from ? where are you going ? " she said , " I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai . "
he will be like a wild donkey among men . his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him . he will live opposite all of his brothers . "
when Abram was ninety @-@ nine years old , Yahweh appeared to Abram , and said to him , " I am God Almighty . walk before me , and be blameless .
neither will your name any more be called Abram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will give to you , and to your seed after you , the land where you are traveling , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession . I will be their God . "
he who is born in your house , and he who is bought with your money , must be circumcised . my covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my covenant . "
all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
and said , " My lord , if now I have found favor in your sight , please don 't go away from your servant .
Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah , and said , " Quickly prepare three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes . "
they asked him , " Where is Sarah , your wife ? " he said , " See , in the tent . "
is anything too hard for Yahweh ? at the set time I will return to you , when the season comes round , and Sarah will have a son . "
since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him ?
I will go down now , and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me . if not , I will know . "
Yahweh said , " If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sake . "
Abraham answered , " See now , I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord , who am but dust and ashes .
he spoke to him yet again , and said , " What if there are forty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it for the forty 's sake . "
the two angels came to Sodom at evening . lot sat in the gate of Sodom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bowed himself with his face to the earth ,
when the morning came , then the angels hurried Lot , saying , " Get up ! take your wife , and your two daughters who are here , lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city . "
but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
he said to him , " Behold , I have granted your request concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken .
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived .
the younger also bore a son , and called his name Ben Ammi . he is the father of the children of Ammon to this day .
Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South , and lived between Kadesh and Shur . he lived as a foreigner in Gerar .
Sarah conceived , and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid , because he is your seed . "
get up , lift up the boy , and hold him in your hand . for I will make him a great nation . "
he lived in the wilderness of Paran . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
he said , " You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand , that it may be a witness to me , that I have dug this well . "
so they made a covenant at Beersheba . Abimelech rose up with Phicol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba , and called there on the name of Yahweh , the Everlasting God .
it happened after these things , that God tested Abraham , and said to him , " Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Abraham said , " God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering , my son . " so they both went together .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
the angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky , and said , " Abraham , Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
it happened after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , " Behold , Milcah , she also has borne children to your brother Nahor :
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a burying @-@ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
" my lord , listen to me . what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you ? therefore bury your dead . "
the field , and the cave that is in it , were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth .
but you shall go to my country , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son Isaac . "
if the woman isn 't willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the servant took ten camels , of his master 's camels , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
the servant ran to meet her , and said , " Please give me a drink , a little water from your pitcher . "
she said , " Drink , my lord . " she hurried , and let down her pitcher on her hand , and gave him drink .
when she had done giving him drink , she said , " I will also draw for your camels , until they have done drinking . "
it happened , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
and said , " Whose daughter are you ? please tell me . is there room in your father 's house for us to lodge in ? "
the man came into the house , and he unloaded the camels . he gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
Yahweh has blessed my master greatly . he has become great . he has given him flocks and herds , silver and gold , male servants and female servants , and camels and donkeys .
my master made me swear , saying , ' You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I live ,
but you shall go to my father 's house , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son . '
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don 't give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
and she will tell me , " Drink , and I will also draw for your camels , " --let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master 's son . '
now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left . "
behold , Rebekah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yahweh has spoken . "
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
her brother and her mother said , " Let the young lady stay with us a few days , at least ten . after that she will go . "
he said to them , " Don 't hinder me , since Yahweh has prospered my way . send me away that I may go to my master . "
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
she said to the servant , " Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? " the servant said , " It is my master . " she took her veil , and covered herself .
Jokshan became the father of Sheba , and Dedan . the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , Letushim , and Leummim .
the sons of Midian : ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . all these were the children of Keturah .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
Yahweh said to her , " Two nations are in your womb . two peoples will be separated from your body . the one people will be stronger than the other people . the elder will serve the younger . "
Esau said , " Behold , I am about to die . what good is the birthright to me ? "
Abimelech said , " What is this you have done to us ? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife , and you would have brought guilt on us ! "
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
the herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac 's herdsmen , saying , " The water is ours . " he called the name of the well Esek , because they contended with him .
that you will do us no harm , as we have not touched you , and as we have done to you nothing but good , and have sent you away in peace . ' you are now the blessed of Yahweh . "
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison .
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them savory food for your father , such as he loves .
you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . "
Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
he came to his father , and said , " My father ? " he said , " Here I am . who are you , my son ? "
Jacob said to his father , " I am Esau your firstborn . I have done what you asked me to do . please arise , sit and eat of my venison , that your soul may bless me . "
Isaac said to his son , " How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? " he said , " Because Yahweh your God gave me success . "
Isaac said to Jacob , " Please come near , that I may feel you , my son , whether you are really my son Esau or not . "
he said , " Are you really my son Esau ? " he said , " I am . "
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
he also made savory food , and brought it to his father . he said to his father , " Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that your soul may bless me . "
when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " Bless me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac his father answered him , " Behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
until your brother 's anger turn away from you , and he forgets what you have done to him . then I will send , and get you from there . why should I be bereaved of you both in one day ? "
and give you the blessing of Abraham , to you , and to your seed with you , that you may inherit the land where you travel , which God gave to Abraham . "
Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
Jacob awakened out of his sleep , and he said , " Surely Yahweh is in this place , and I didn 't know it . "
he was afraid , and said , " How dreadful is this place ! this is none other than God 's house , and this is the gate of heaven . "
Jacob said to them , " My relatives , where are you from ? " they said , " We are from Haran . "
he said to them , " Is it well with him ? " they said , " It is well . see , Rachel , his daughter , is coming with the sheep . "
Laban said , " It is better that I give her to you , than that I should give her to another man . stay with me . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
she conceived again , and bore a son , and said , " Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated , he has therefore given me this son also . " she named him Simeon .
she said , " Behold , my maid Bilhah . go in to her , that she may bear on my knees , and I also may obtain children by her . "
Rachel said , " God has judged me , and has also heard my voice , and has given me a son . " therefore called she his name Dan .
when Leah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zilpah , her handmaid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
it happened , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
he said , " What shall I give you ? " Jacob said , " You shall not give me anything . if you will do this thing for me , I will again feed your flock and keep it .
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were feeble , he didn 't put them in . so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
the man increased exceedingly , and had large flocks , female servants and male servants , and camels and donkeys .
he heard the words of Laban 's sons , saying , " Jacob has taken away all that was our father 's . from that which was our father 's , has he gotten all this wealth . "
Yahweh said to Jacob , " Return to the land of your fathers , and to your relatives , and I will be with you . "
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a pillar , where you vowed a vow to me . now arise , get out from this land , and return to the land of your birth . ' "
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead .
now that you have felt around in all my stuff , what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven 't eaten the rams of your flocks .
that which was torn of animals , I didn 't bring to you . I bore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
this was my situation : in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep fled from my eyes .
may this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
when he saw them , Jacob said , " This is God 's army . " he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , the field of Edom .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks , and the herds , and the camels , into two companies ;
and he said , " If Esau comes to the one company , and strikes it , then the company which is left will escape . "
please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded the foremost , saying , " When Esau , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' Whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Esau , when you find him .
when he saw that he didn 't prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was strained , as he wrestled .
the man said , " Let me go , for the day breaks . " Jacob said , " I won 't let you go , unless you bless me . "
he said , " Your name will no longer be called Jacob , but Israel ; for you have fought with God and with men , and have prevailed . "
Jacob asked him , " Please tell me your name . " he said , " Why is it that you ask what my name is ? " he blessed him there .
Esau said , " What do you mean by all this company which I met ? " Jacob said , " To find favor in the sight of my lord . "
please take the gift that I brought to you , because God has dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . " he urged him , and he took it .
Esau said , " Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me . " he said , " Why ? let me find favor in the sight of my lord . "
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan Aram ; and encamped before the city .
Dinah , the daughter of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
ask me a great amount for a dowry , and I will give whatever you ask of me , but give me the young lady as a wife . "
and said to them , " We can 't do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised ; for that is a reproach to us .
then will we give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if you will not listen to us , to be circumcised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man didn 't wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor , and to Shechem his son ; and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
it happened on the third day , when they were sore , that two of Jacob 's sons , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brothers , each took his sword , came upon the unsuspecting city , and killed all the males .
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
God said to Jacob , " Arise , go up to Bethel , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " Put away the foreign gods that are among you , purify yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they traveled , and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them , and they didn 't pursue the sons of Jacob .
God said to him , " I am God Almighty . be fruitful and multiply . a nation and a company of nations will be from you , and kings will come out of your body .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
when she was in hard labor , the midwife said to her , " Don 't be afraid , for now you will have another son . "
Jacob set up a pillar on her grave . the same is the Pillar of Rachel 's grave to this day .
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon , the Hittite ; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , the Hivite ;
Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jalam , and Korah . these are the sons of Esau , who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
Timna was concubine to Eliphaz , Esau 's son ; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek . these are the sons of Adah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Reuel : Nahath , Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah . these were the sons of Basemath , Esau 's wife .
these were the sons of Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : she bore to Esau Jeush , Jalam , and Korah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau : chief Teman , chief Omar , chief Zepho , chief Kenaz ,
these are the sons of Oholibamah , Esau 's wife : chief Jeush , chief Jalam , chief Korah : these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the children of Zibeon : Aiah and Anah . this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness , as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father .
these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before any king reigned over the children of Israel .
Husham died , and hadad , the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . the name of his city was Avith .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
chief Magdiel , and chief Iram . these are the chiefs of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession . this is Esau , the father of the Edomites .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age , and he made him a coat of many colors .
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
Israel said to Joseph , " aren 't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send you to them . " he said to him , " Here I am . "
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Reuben heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , " Let 's not take his life . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
come , and let 's sell him to the Ishmaelites , and not let our hand be on him ; for he is our brother , our flesh . " his brothers listened to him .
Midianites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
he returned to his brothers , and said , " The child is no more ; and I , where will I go ? "
they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a male goat , and dipped the coat in the blood .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard .
it happened at that time , that Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
Judah said to Onan , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
he said , " I will send you a young goat from the flock . " she said , " Will you give me a pledge , until you send it ? "
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
then he asked the men of her place , saying , " Where is the prostitute , that was at Enaim by the road ? " they said , " There has been no prostitute here . "
he returned to Judah , and said , " I haven 't found her ; and also the men of the place said , ' There has been no prostitute here . ' "
Judah acknowledged them , and said , " She is more righteous than I , because I didn 't give her to Shelah , my son . " he knew her again no more .
it happened in the time of her travail , that behold , twins were in her womb .
when she travailed , one put out a hand , and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand , saying , " This came out first . "
afterward his brother came out , that had the scarlet thread on his hand , and his name was called Zerah .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mock me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand . "
but remember me when it will be well with you , and please show kindness to me , and make mention of me to Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon . "
in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head . "
behold , seven heads of grain , thin and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
it happened , as he interpreted to us , so it was : he restored me to my office , and he hanged him . "
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . he shaved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Pharaoh .
and behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , fat and sleek . they fed in the marsh grass ,
and behold , seven heads of grain , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
Joseph said to Pharaoh , " The dream of Pharaoh is one . what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh .
that is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh .
there will arise after them seven years of famine , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt . the famine will consume the land ,
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , " Why do you look at one another ? "
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them , and said to them , " You are spies ! you have come to see the nakedness of the land . "
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
we are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan . '
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
he asked them of their welfare , and said , " Is your father well , the old man of whom you spoke ? is he yet alive ? "
they said , " Your servant , our father , is well . he is still alive . " they bowed down humbly .
he washed his face , and came out . he controlled himself , and said , " Serve the meal . "
he commanded the steward of his house , saying , " Fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
isn 't this that from which my lord drinks , and by which he indeed divines ? you have done evil in so doing . ' "
they said to him , " Why does my lord speak such words as these ? far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing !
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
with whomever of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondservants . "
he searched , beginning with the eldest , and ending at the youngest . the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
Joseph said to them , " What deed is this that you have done ? Don 't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine ? "
you said to your servants , ' Bring him down to me , that I may set my eyes on him . '
we said to my lord , ' The boy can 't leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " Surely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven 't seen him since .
now therefore when I come to your servant my father , and the boy is not with us ; since his life is bound up in the boy 's life ;
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bondservant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
Joseph said to his brothers , " Come near to me , please . " they came near . " he said , I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
for these two years the famine has been in the land , and there are yet five years , in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
he gave each one of them changes of clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing .
he sent the following to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
he said , " I am God , the God of your father . Don 't be afraid to go down into Egypt , for there I will make of you a great nation .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
these are the sons of Rachel , who were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
all the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt , who were his direct descendants , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were sixty @-@ six .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
Israel said to Joseph , " Now let me die , since I have seen your face , that you are still alive . "
Pharaoh said to his brothers , " What is your occupation ? " they said to Pharaoh , " Your servants are shepherds , both we , and our fathers . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh , for every man of the Egyptians sold his field , because the famine was severe on them , and the land became Pharaoh 's .
they said , " You have saved our lives ! let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone didn 't become Pharaoh 's .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @-@ seven years .
he said , " swear to me , " and he swore to him . Israel bowed himself on the bed 's head .
it happened after these things , that someone said to Joseph , " Behold , your father is sick . " he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
someone told Jacob , and said , " Behold , your son Joseph comes to you , " and Israel strengthened himself , and sat on the bed .
Joseph said to his father , " They are my sons , whom God has given me here . " he said , " Please bring them to me , and I will bless them . "
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he couldn 't see . he brought them near to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
Israel said to Joseph , " I didn 't think I would see your face , and behold , God has let me see your seed also . "
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
Israel said to Joseph , " Behold , I am dying , but God will be with you , and bring you again to the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . "
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
" Reuben , you are my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength ; excelling in dignity , and excelling in power .
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
" Judah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleasant . he bows his shoulder to the burden , and becomes a servant doing forced labor .
he instructed them , and said to them , " I am to be gathered to my people . bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place .
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
forty days were fulfilled for him , for that is how many the days it takes to embalm . the Egyptians wept for him for seventy days .
when the days of weeping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation . he mourned for his father seven days .
when Joseph 's brothers saw that their father was dead , they said , " It may be that Joseph will hate us , and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him . "
now therefore don 't be afraid . I will nourish you and your little ones . " he comforted them , and spoke kindly to them .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
and they made their lives bitter with hard service , in mortar and in brick , and in all kinds of service in the field , all their service , in which they ruthlessly made them serve .
the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said to them , " Why have you done this thing , and have saved the boys alive ? "
the woman conceived , and bore a son . when she saw that he was a fine child , she hid him three months .
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
Pharaoh 's daughter came down to bathe at the river . her maidens walked along by the riverside . she saw the basket among the reeds , and sent her handmaid to get it .
then his sister said to Pharaoh 's daughter , " Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for you ? "
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
he said to his daughters , " Where is he ? why is it that you have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread . "
Moses said , " I will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt . "
Yahweh said , " I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters , for I know their sorrows .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
he said , " Certainly I will be with you . this will be the token to you , that I have sent you : when you have brought the people out of Egypt , you shall serve God on this mountain . "
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
Moses answered , " But , behold , they will not believe me , nor listen to my voice ; for they will say , ' Yahweh has not appeared to you . ' "
he said , " Throw it on the ground . " he threw it on the ground , and it became a snake ; and Moses ran away from it .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand , and take it by the tail . " he stretched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a rod in his hand .
" that they may believe that Yahweh , the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has appeared to you . "
Yahweh said to him , " Who made man 's mouth ? or who makes one mute , or deaf , or seeing , or blind ? isn 't it I , Yahweh ?
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a donkey , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
it happened on the way at a lodging place , that Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him .
then Zipporah took a flint , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet ; and she said , " Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me . "
so he let him alone . then she said , " You are a bridegroom of blood , " because of the circumcision .
Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him , and all the signs with which he had instructed him .
the people believed , and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Pharaoh , " This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
Pharaoh said , " Who is Yahweh , that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go ? I don 't know Yahweh , and moreover I will not let Israel go . "
the king of Egypt said to them , " Why do you , Moses and Aaron , take the people from their work ? get back to your burdens ! "
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
but he said , " You are idle ! you are idle ! therefore you say , ' Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh . '
I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
" go in , speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land . "
Moses spoke before Yahweh , saying , " Behold , the children of Israel haven 't listened to me . how then shall Pharaoh listen to me , who am of uncircumcised lips ? "
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
the sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . these are the families of the Levites according to their generations .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Yahweh said , " Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
Moses said before Yahweh , " Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh listen to me ? "
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , " This is what Yahweh says , ' Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the frogs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments , and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt .
the frogs shall depart from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth .
I will put a division between my people and your people : by tomorrow shall this sign be . " ' "
Yahweh did so ; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies .
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
then Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron , " Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go , just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses .
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh . "
not so ! go now you who are men , and serve Yahweh ; for that is what you desire ! " they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste , and he said , " I have sinned against Yahweh your God , and against you .
now therefore please forgive my sin again , and pray to Yahweh your God , that he may also take away from me this death . "
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
Moses said , " You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God .
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
but against any of the children of Israel a dog won 't even bark or move its tongue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Pharaoh won 't listen to you , that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt . "
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh , and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
Don 't eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
this day shall be to you for a memorial , and you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh : throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said to them , " Draw out , and take lambs according to your families , and kill the Passover .
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in haste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . they despoiled the Egyptians .
the children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot who were men , besides children .
seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh .
" it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , as he swore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons .
it shall be for a sign on your hand , and for symbols between your eyes : for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt . "
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over all of them .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
the angel of God , who went before the camp of Israel , moved and went behind them ; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them , and stood behind them .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the sea , that the waters may come again on the Egyptians , on their chariots , and on their horsemen . "
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
your right hand , Yahweh , is glorious in power . your right hand , Yahweh , dashes the enemy in pieces .
in the greatness of your excellency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stubble .
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Yahweh , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances .
Miriam answered them , " Sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea . "
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
and in the morning , then you shall see the glory of Yahweh ; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh . who are we , that you murmur against us ? "
Moses said to Aaron , " Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel , ' Come near before Yahweh , for he has heard your murmurings . ' "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the frost on the ground .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one , and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it didn 't become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
Moses said , " Eat that today , for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh . today you shall not find it in the field .
behold , because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
all the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
therefore the people quarreled with Moses , and said , " Give us water to drink . " Moses said to them , " Why do you quarrel with me ? why do you test Yahweh ? "
the people were thirsty for water there ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
Moses said to Joshua , " Choose men for us , and go out , fight with Amalek . tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God 's rod in my hand . "
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , received Zipporah , Moses ' wife , after he had sent her away ,
and her two sons . the name of one son was Gershom , for Moses said , " I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land . "
the name of the other was Eliezer , for he said , " My father 's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh 's sword . "
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro said , " Blessed be Yahweh , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
Moses said to his father @-@ in @-@ law , " Because the people come to me to inquire of God .
when they have a matter , they come to me , and I judge between a man and his neighbor , and I make them know the statutes of God , and his laws . "
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
all the people answered together , and said , " All that Yahweh has spoken we will do . " Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh .
and be ready against the third day ; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai .
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain .
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day ; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day , and made it holy .
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
Moses said to the people , " Don 't be afraid , for God has come to test you , and that his fear may be before you , that you won 't sin . "
" if you buy a Hebrew servant , he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything .
but if the servant shall plainly say , ' I love my master , my wife , and my children . I will not go out free ; '
" if a man sells his daughter to be a female servant , she shall not go out as the male servants do .
if a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him , you shall take him from my altar , that he may die .
" if men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone , or with his fist , and he doesn 't die , but is confined to bed ;
" if a man strikes his servant 's eye , or his maid 's eye , and destroys it , he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter , according to this judgment it shall be done to him .
if the bull Gores a male servant or a female servant , thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master , and the ox shall be stoned .
" if a man opens a pit , or if a man digs a pit and doesn 't cover it , and a bull or a donkey falls into it ,
" if one man 's bull injures another 's , so that it dies , then they shall sell the live bull , and divide its price ; and they shall also divide the dead animal .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of GORING in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
if the thief is found breaking in , and is struck so that he dies , there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
" you shall not wrong an alien , neither shall you oppress him , for you were aliens in the land of Egypt .
and my wrath will grow hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
" you shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses . " you shall give the firstborn of your sons to me .
you shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep . seven days it shall be with its mother , then on the eighth day you shall give it to me .
" you shall be holy men to me , therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field . you shall cast it to the dogs .
" you shall not follow a crowd to do evil ; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice ;
" if you meet your enemy 's ox or his donkey going astray , you shall surely bring it back to him again .
if you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under his burden , don 't leave him , you shall surely help him with it .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don 't invoke the name of other gods , neither let them be heard out of your mouth .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread , neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning .
" behold , I send an angel before you , to keep you by the way , and to bring you into the place which I have prepared .
but if you indeed listen to his voice , and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy to your enemies , and an adversary to your adversaries .
you shall serve Yahweh your God , and he will bless your bread and your water , and I will take sickness away from your midst .
I will not drive them out from before you in one year , lest the land become desolate , and the animals of the field multiply against you .
he said to Moses , " Come up to Yahweh , you , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship from a distance .
Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh , and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do . "
Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh , and rose up early in the morning , and built an altar under the mountain , and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel .
he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Yahweh has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
the glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days . the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up on the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .

he said , " My presence will go with you , and I will give you rest . "
then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back ; but my face shall not be seen . "
he chiseled two tablets of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount Sinai , as Yahweh had commanded him , and took in his hand two stone tablets .
Yahweh passed by before him , and proclaimed , " Yahweh ! Yahweh , a merciful and gracious God , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness and truth ,
observe that which I command you this day . behold , I drive out before you the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .

" six days you shall work , but on the seventh day you shall rest : in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Write you these words : for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel . "
he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights ; he neither ate bread , nor drank water . he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
afterward all the children of Israel came near , and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
but when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
the children of Israel saw Moses ' face , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
'Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you , a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh : whoever does any work in it shall be put to death .

in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship .

Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab , and every wise @-@ hearted man , in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom , even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it :
and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , with which to make it . they brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning .
they spoke to Moses , saying , " The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make . "

the cherubim spread out their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , with their faces toward one another . the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat .
he made a border of a handbreadth around it , and made a golden molding on its border around it .
the rings were close by the border , the places for the poles to carry the table .
he made the vessels which were on the table , its dishes , its spoons , its bowls , and its pitchers with which to pour out , of pure gold .
he made the lampstand of pure gold . he made the lampstand of beaten work . its base , its shaft , its cups , its buds , and its flowers were of one piece with it .
there were six branches going out of its sides : three branches of the lampstand out of its one side , and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side :
he made the altar of incense of acacia wood . it was square : its length was a cubit , and its breadth a cubit . its height was two cubits . its horns were of one piece with it .
he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood . it was square . its length was five cubits , its breadth was five cubits , and its height was three cubits .
he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , the shovels , the basins , the forks , and the fire pans . he made all its vessels of brass .
he cast four rings for the four ends of brass grating , to be places for the poles .
he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar , with which to carry it . he made it hollow with planks .
the sockets around the court , the sockets of the gate of the court , all the pins of the tabernacle , and all the pins around the court .

a bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , around the skirts of the robe , to minister in , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote on it a writing , like the engravings of a signet : " Holy TO Yahweh . "

Moses raised up the tabernacle , and laid its sockets , and set up its boards , and put in its bars , and raised up its pillars .
he spread the covering over the tent , and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it , as Yahweh commanded Moses .

which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh , in the wilderness of Sinai .
" take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the anointing oil , and the bull of the sin offering , and the two rams , and the basket of unleavened bread ;

he also killed the bull and the ram , the sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons delivered to him the blood , which he sprinkled around on the altar ,
Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people , and blessed them ; and he came down from offering the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and the peace offerings .
Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people .
there came forth fire from before Yahweh , and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar : and when all the people saw it , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
so they drew near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp , as Moses had said .
and you shall eat it in a holy place , because it is your portion , and your sons ' portion , of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire : for so I am commanded .
Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burned : and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar , the sons of Aaron who were left , saying ,
" why haven 't you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary , since it is most holy , and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before Yahweh ?
behold , its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary : you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary , as I commanded . "

you shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps , neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them , that you should be defiled thereby .
for I am Yahweh your God . sanctify yourselves therefore , and be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall you defile yourselves with any kind of creeping thing that moves on the earth .
for I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God . you shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .

Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp , and stoned him with stones . the children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land which I give you , then the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh .
six years you shall sow your field , and six years you shall prune your vineyard , and gather in its fruits ;
but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land , a Sabbath to Yahweh . you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard .
what grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap , and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather . it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land .
the Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you ; for yourself , for your servant , for your maid , for your hired servant , and for your stranger , who lives as a foreigner with you .
" ' you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years , seven times seven years ; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years , even forty @-@ nine years .
then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month . on the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land .
according to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor . according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you .
" ' therefore you shall do my statutes , and keep my ordinances and do them ; and you shall dwell in the land in safety .
then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years .
you shall sow the eighth year , and eat of the fruits , the old store ; until the ninth year , until its fruits come in , you shall eat the old store .
then let him reckon the years since its sale , and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it ; and he shall return to his property .
but the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall be released in the Jubilee .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
" ' if your brother has grown poor among you , and sells himself to you ; you shall not make him to serve as a slave .
as a hired servant , and as a temporary resident , he shall be with you ; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee :
" ' as for your male and your female slaves , whom you may have ; of the nations that are around you , from them you may buy male and female slaves .
" ' if an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich , and your brother beside him has grown poor , and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you , or to a member of the stranger 's family ;
if he isn 't redeemed by these means , then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee , he , and his children with him .
for to me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt . I am Yahweh your God .
then I will give you your rains in their season , and the land shall yield its increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand ; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that you should not be their slaves ; and I have broken the bars of your yoke , and made you go upright .
" ' but if you will not listen to me , and will not do all these commandments ;
and your strength will be spent in vain ; for your land won 't yield its increase , neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit .
" ' if you walk contrary to me , and won 't listen to me , then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins .
I will send the wild animals among you , which will rob you of your children , destroy your livestock , and make you few in number ; and your roads will become desolate .
then I will walk contrary to you in wrath ; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins .
I will destroy your high places , and cut down your incense altars , and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols ; and my soul will abhor you .
as long as it lies desolate it shall have rest , even the rest which it didn 't have in your sabbaths , when you lived on it .
you will perish among the nations , and the land of your enemies will eat you up .
I also walked contrary to them , and brought them into the land of their enemies : if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled , and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity ;
then I will remember my covenant with Jacob ; and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham ; and I will remember the land .
" ' when a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh , then the priest shall evaluate it , whether it is good or bad : as the priest shall evaluate it , so shall it stand .
but if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee , then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee ; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation .
if he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it , and it shall remain his .
if he will not redeem the field , or if he has sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more ;
but the field , when it goes out in the Jubilee , shall be holy to Yahweh , as a field devoted ; it shall be owned by the priests .
then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee ; and he shall give your valuation on that day , as a holy thing to Yahweh .
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the Tent of Meeting , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
from twenty years old and upward , all who are able to go out to war in Israel . you and Aaron shall number them by their divisions .
these are those who were numbered , whom Moses and Aaron numbered , and the princes of Israel , being twelve men : they were each one for his fathers ' house .
so all those who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers ' houses , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war in Israel ;
" only the tribe of Levi you shall not number , neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel ;
when the tabernacle is to move , the Levites shall take it down ; and when the tabernacle is to be set up , the Levites shall set it up . the stranger who comes near shall be put to death .
but the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony , that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of the Testimony . "
all who were numbered of the camp of Judah were one hundred eighty @-@ six thousand four hundred , according to their divisions . they shall set out first .
" all who were numbered of the camp of Reuben were one hundred fifty @-@ one thousand four hundred fifty , according to their armies . they shall set out second .
" all who were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred eight thousand one hundred , according to their divisions . they shall set out third .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were forty @-@ one thousand and five hundred .
" all who were numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred fifty @-@ seven thousand six hundred . they shall set out last by their standards . "
these are those who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers ' houses . all who were numbered of the camps according to their armies were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty .
thus the children of Israel did . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so they encamped by their standards , and so they set out , everyone by their families , according to their fathers ' houses .
" bring the tribe of Levi near , and set them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister to him .
they shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting , and the obligations of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
you shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons . they are wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel .
" count the children of Levi by their fathers ' houses , by their families . you shall count every male from a month old and upward . "
according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , there were eight thousand six hundred , keeping the requirements of the sanctuary .
Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the princes of the Levites , with the oversight of those who keep the requirements of the sanctuary .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons , according to the word of Yahweh , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old , all who enter into the service , to do the work in the Tent of Meeting .
when the camp moves forward , Aaron shall go in , and his sons , and they shall take down the veil of the screen , and cover the ark of the Testimony with it ,
" they shall take a blue cloth , and cover the lampstand of the light , and its lamps , and its snuffers , and its snuff dishes , and all its oil vessels , with which they minister to it .
" they shall take all the vessels of ministry , with which they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a blue cloth , and cover them with a covering of sealskin , and shall put them on the frame .
but thus do to them , that they may live , and not die , when they approach to the most holy things : Aaron and his sons shall go in , and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden ;
they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle , and the Tent of Meeting , its covering , and the covering of sealskin that is above on it , and the screen for the door of the Tent of Meeting ,
at the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burden , and in all their service ; and you shall appoint their duty to them in all their responsibilities .
this is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the Tent of Meeting : and their duty shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
you shall count them from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old , everyone who enters on the service , to do the work of the Tent of Meeting .
this is the duty of their burden , according to all their service in the Tent of Meeting : the tabernacle 's boards , its bars , its pillars , its sockets ,
from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old , everyone who entered into the service , for work in the Tent of Meeting .
these are those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites , all who served in the Tent of Meeting , whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .
from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old , everyone who entered into the service , for work in the Tent of Meeting ,
from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old , everyone who entered into the service , for work in the Tent of Meeting ,
these are those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari , whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .
all those who were numbered of the Levites , whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered , by their families , and by their fathers ' houses ,
every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they present to the priest , shall be his .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them : ' if any man 's wife goes astray , and is unfaithful to him ,
but if you have gone astray , being under your husband , and if you are defiled , and some man has lain with you besides your husband : "
and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels , and make your body swell , and your thigh fall away . " the woman shall say , " Amen , Amen . "
he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse ; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter .
the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh , and bring it to the altar .
the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering , as its memorial , and burn it on the altar , and afterward shall make the woman drink the water .
the priest shall offer one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make atonement for him , because he sinned by reason of the dead , and shall make his head holy that same day .
he shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation , and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering ; but the former days shall be void , because his separation was defiled .
" so they shall put my name on the children of Israel ; and I will bless them . "
and they brought their offering before Yahweh , six covered wagons , and twelve oxen ; a wagon for every two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they presented them before the tabernacle .
and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari , according to their service , under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but to the sons of Kohath he gave none , because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them ; they carried it on their shoulders .
the princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes gave their offerings before the altar .
Yahweh said to Moses , " They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedication of the altar . "
he who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah ,
one young bull , one ram , one male lamb a year old , for a burnt offering ;
this was the dedication of the altar , on the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve silver platters , twelve silver bowls , twelve golden ladles ;
the twelve golden ladles , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; all the gold of the ladles weighed one hundred twenty shekels ;
all the cattle for the burnt offering twelve bulls , the rams twelve , the male lambs a year old twelve , and their meal offering ; and the male goats for a sin offering twelve ;
" speak to Aaron , and tell him , ' When you light the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand . ' "
Aaron did so . he lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lampstand , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
you shall do this to them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of cleansing on them , let them shave their whole bodies with a razor , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves .
" after that , the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting : and you shall cleanse them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for myself .
Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so the children of Israel did to them .
the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh ; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them .
after that , the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron , and before his sons : as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so they did to them .
but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
there were certain men , who were unclean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
" say to the children of Israel , ' If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body , or is on a journey far away , he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh .
in the second month , on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it ; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it .
whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent , then after that the children of Israel traveled ; and in the place where the cloud remained , there the children of Israel encamped .
sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle ; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped , and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled .
sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning ; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning , they traveled : or by day and by night , when the cloud was taken up , they traveled .
at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped , and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled . they kept Yahweh 's command , at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .
when you blow an alarm the second time , the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward . they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
" the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets . this shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations .
the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran .
the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies . Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
he said to him , " I will not go ; but I will depart to my own land , and to my relatives . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days ' journey . the ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the ark went forward , that Moses said , " Rise up , Yahweh , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh . when Yahweh heard it , his anger was kindled ; and Yahweh 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly : and the children of Israel also wept again , and said , " Who will give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
but now we have lost our appetite . there is nothing at all except this manna to look at . "
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in mortars , and boiled it in pots , and made cakes of it . its taste was like the taste of fresh oil .
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they weep to me , saying , ' Give us meat , that we may eat . '
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don 't let me see my wretchedness . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Has Yahweh 's hand grown short ? now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not . "
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the quails . he who gathered least gathered ten homers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people , and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague .
Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses , to Aaron , and to Miriam , " You three come out to the Tent of Meeting ! " the three of them came out .
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the Tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forward .
he said , " Hear now my words . if there is a prophet among you , I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
they came to the valley of Eshcol , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , " Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it . "
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said to them , " Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who spied out the land , tore their clothes :
only don 't rebel against Yahweh , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Yahweh is with us . Don 't fear them . "
but all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Yahweh appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
Yahweh said to Moses , " How long will this people despise me ? and how long will they not believe in me , for all the signs which I have worked among them ?
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
tell them , ' As I live , says Yahweh , surely as you have spoken in my ears , so will I do to you :
surely you shall not come into the land , concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
I , Yahweh , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
Moses said , " Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh , since it shall not prosper ?
then the Amalekite came down , and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain , and struck them and beat them down , even to Hormah .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habitations , which I give to you ,
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a Hin of oil :
when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or for peace offerings to Yahweh ;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a Hin of oil :
for the assembly , there shall be one statute for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner , a statute forever throughout your generations : as you are , so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh .
one law and one ordinance shall be for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you . ' "
of the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations .
" ' if one person sins unwittingly , then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering .
the priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs , when he sins unwittingly , before Yahweh , to make atonement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue :
and that he has brought you near , and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you ? and do you seek the priesthood also ?
therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh : and Aaron , what is he that you murmur against him ? "
Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab ; and they said , " We won 't come up :
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
moreover you haven 't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : will you put out the eyes of these men ? we won 't come up . "
Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation .
he spoke to the congregation , saying , " Depart , please , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest you be consumed in all their sins ! "
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who appertained to Korah , and all their goods .
so they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into Sheol : and the earth closed on them , and they perished from among the assembly .
Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers , which those who were burnt had offered ; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar ,
it happened , when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Yahweh appeared .
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the incense , and made atonement for the people .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .
you shall write Aaron 's name on the rod of Levi ; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers ' houses .
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
everyone who comes near , who comes near to the tabernacle of Yahweh , dies ! will we all perish ? "
they shall be joined to you , and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting , for all the service of the Tent : and a stranger shall not come near to you .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Yahweh , to do the service of the Tent of Meeting .
you shall eat of it like the most holy things . every male shall eat of it . it shall be holy to you .
everything that opens the womb , of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh , both of man and animal shall be yours : nevertheless you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man , and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals .
their flesh shall be yours , as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh , it shall be yours .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
" to the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the Tent of Meeting .
but the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes , which you receive of the children of Israel ; and of it you shall give Yahweh 's wave offering to Aaron the priest .
you shall eat it in every place , you and your households : for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting .
" this is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded : speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red heifer without spot , in which is no blemish , and which was never yoked .
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times .
one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the evening .
" whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month : and the people stayed in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness , that we should die there , we and our animals ?
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them .
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock , and he said to them , " Hear now , you rebels ; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you ? "
and when we cried to Yahweh , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth out of Egypt : and behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of your border .
Edom said to him , " You shall not pass through me , lest I come out with the sword against you . "
they traveled from Kadesh : and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came to Mount Hor .
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah .
when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they wept for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them captive .
Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities . "
Moses made a serpent of brass , and set it on the standard : and it happened , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he looked to the serpent of brass , he lived .
from there they traveled to Beer : that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses , " Gather the people together , and I will give them water . "
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looks down on the desert .
Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Jahaz ; and he fought against Israel .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even to the Arnon .
we have shot at them . Heshbon has perished even to Dibon . we have laid waste even to Nophah , Which reaches to Medeba . "
they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came to Balaam , and spoke to him the words of Balak .
he said to them , " Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as Yahweh shall speak to me . " the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
'Behold , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the surface of the earth : now , come curse me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
God said to Balaam , " You shall not go with them . you shall not curse the people ; for they are blessed . "
Balaam rose up in the morning , and said to the princes of Balak , " Go to your land ; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you . "
they came to Balaam , and said to him , " Thus says Balak the son of Zippor , ' Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me :
for I will promote you to very great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . please come therefore , and curse this people for me . ' "
then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she lay down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , " What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? "
the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
Balak said to Balaam , " didn 't I earnestly send to you to call you ? why didn 't you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? "
God met Balaam : and he said to him , " I have prepared the seven altars , and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar . "
Yahweh put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , " Return to Balak , and thus you shall speak . "
who can count the dust of Jacob , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous ! let my last end be like his ! "
he came to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . Balak said to him , " What has Yahweh spoken ? "
he took up his parable , and said , " Rise up , Balak , and hear ! listen to me , you son of Zippor .
surely there is no enchantment with Jacob ; Neither is there any divination with Israel . now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What has God done !
when Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel , he didn 't go , as at the other times , to meet with enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came on him .
water shall flow from his buckets . his seed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than Agag . his kingdom shall be exalted .
therefore now flee you to your place ! I thought to promote you to great honor ; but , behold , Yahweh has kept you back from honor . "
he looked at Amalek , and took up his parable , and said , " Amalek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods ; and the people ate , and bowed down to their gods .
Moses said to the judges of Israel , " Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor . "
it happened after the plague , that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , saying ,
these are those who were numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
notwithstanding , the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , who was born to Levi in Egypt : and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
these are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
for Yahweh had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . there was not left a man of them , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go up into this mountain of Abarim , and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel .
" let Yahweh , the God of the spirits of all flesh , appoint a man over the congregation ,
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
you shall put of your honor on him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey .
with the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with the fourth part of a Hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
" ' on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish , and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , and the drink offering of it :
this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath , besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for each bull ; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb ; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
one male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh ; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : two young bulls , one ram , seven male lambs a year old ;
besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , you shall offer them ( they shall be to you without blemish ) , and their drink offerings .
you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : one young bull , one ram , seven male lambs a year old without blemish ;
" ' on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation ; and you shall afflict your souls : you shall do no kind of work ;
but you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh for a pleasant aroma : one young bull , one ram , seven male lambs a year old ; they shall be to you without blemish ;
and one male goat for a sin offering , besides the continual burnt offering , the meal offering of it , and the drink offering of it .
" ' on the second day you shall offer twelve young bulls , two rams , fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and one male goat for a sin offering ; besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , and their drink offerings .
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
" ' on the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly : you shall do no servile work ;
Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded .
" but the vow of a widow , or of her who is divorced , everything with which she has bound her soul , shall stand against her .
so there were delivered , out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their flocks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their encampments , they burnt with fire .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor , and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh .
" Encamp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred ; of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys , and of the flocks .
and thirty @-@ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
the donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred ; of which Yahweh 's tribute was sixty @-@ one .
Moses gave the tribute , which was Yahweh 's wave offering , to Eleazar the priest , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the Tent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh .
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don 't bring us over the Jordan . "
Moses said to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , " Shall your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them ?
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
" behold , you have risen up in your fathers ' place , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel .
for if you turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and you will destroy all this people . "
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
Moses said to them , " If you will do this thing , if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war ,
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
build cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth . "
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying , " Your servants will do as my lord commands .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our livestock , shall be there in the cities of Gilead ;
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , " As Yahweh has said to your servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan . "
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
you shall take possession of the land , and dwell therein ; for I have given given the land to you to possess it .
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
" ' for the western border , you shall have the great sea and its border : this shall be your west border .
and the border shall go forth to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
these are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Levites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @-@ two cities .
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the Avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
and the Avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the Avenger of blood kill the manslayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Yahweh , saying , " The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
for Mahlah , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married to their father 's brothers ' sons .
they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness , in the Arabah over against Suph , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
I spoke to you at that time , saying , " I am not able to bear you myself alone :
I commanded your judges at that time , saying , " Hear cases between your brothers , and judge righteously between a man and his brother , and the foreigner who is living with him .
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which Yahweh our God gives to us .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
Joshua the son of Nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yahweh spoke to me ; and we encircled Mount Seir many days .
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and called them , even Bashan , after his own name , Havvoth Jair , to this day . )
but Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and didn 't listen to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " Let it suffice you ; speak no more to me of this matter .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you .
you came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
but Yahweh has taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be to him a people of inheritance , as at this day .
but I must die in this land , I must not go over the Jordan ; but you shall go over , and possess that good land .
did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as you have heard , and live ?
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , for the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , for the Manassites .
beyond the Jordan , in the valley over against Beth Peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel struck , when they came forth out of Egypt .
they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , even to Mount Sion ( the same is Hermon ) ,
Yahweh didn 't make this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
you shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
you shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples who are around you ;
you shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he swore to our fathers .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God : Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Yahweh didn 't set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fewest of all peoples :
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
it shall be , if you shall forget Yahweh your God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish .
hear , Israel : you are to pass over the Jordan this day , to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself , cities great and fortified up to the sky ,
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sinned against Yahweh your God ; you had made yourselves a molten calf : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
at that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , to stand before Yahweh to minister to him , and to bless in his name , to this day .
Yahweh said to me , " Arise , take your journey before the people ; and they shall go in and possess the land , which I swore to their fathers to give to them . "
for Yahweh your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who doesn 't respect persons , nor takes reward .
you shall fear Yahweh your God ; you shall serve him ; and you shall cling to him , and you shall swear by his name .
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
a land which Yahweh your God cares for : the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them , as the days of the heavens above the earth .
for if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Yahweh your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
only you shall not eat the blood ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
only be sure that you don 't eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
you shall walk after Yahweh your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and you shall serve him , and cling to him .
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you .
certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you , and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city , saying , " Let us go and serve other gods , " which you have not known ;
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
but these are they of which you shall not eat : the eagle , and the vulture , and the osprey ,
you shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
then you shall take an awl , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
you shall eat it within your gates : the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gazelle , and as the hart .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
six days you shall eat unleavened bread . on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God ; you shall do no work .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress :
you shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
you shall prepare you the way , and divide the borders of your land , which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , into three parts , that every manslayer may flee there .
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there , and deliver him into the hand of the Avenger of blood , that he may die .
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
those who remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you .
and shall tell them , " Hear , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don 't let your heart faint ; don 't be afraid , nor tremble , neither be scared of them ;
for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you . "
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated ;
but he shall acknowledge the firstborn , the son of the hated , by giving him a double portion of all that he has ; for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
you shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
and the young lady 's father shall tell the elders , " I gave my daughter to this man to wife , and he hates her ;
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
he who is wounded in the stones , or has his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
a bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever :
you shall not abhor an Edomite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abhor an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleases him best : you shall not oppress him .
there shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel , neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
you shall not deprive the foreigner , or the fatherless of justice , nor take a widow 's clothing in pledge ;
but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
if there is a controversy between men , and they come to judgment , and the judges judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked ;
it shall be , that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blotted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don 't want to take her " ;
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
and we cried to Yahweh , the God of our fathers , and Yahweh heard our voice , and saw our affliction , and our toil , and our oppression ;
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
there you shall build an altar to Yahweh your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel , saying , " Keep silence , and listen , Israel : this day you have become the people of Yahweh your God .
you shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command you this day . "
'Cursed is he who the foreigner , fatherless , and widow of justice . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with his father 's wife , because he has uncovered his father 's skirt . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who doesn 't confirm the words of this law to do them . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . ' "
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself , as he has sworn to you ; if you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and walk in his ways .
Yahweh will make you plenteous for good , in the fruit of your body , and in the fruit of your livestock , and in the fruit of your ground , in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you .
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
you shall become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away .
you shall carry much seed out into the field , and shall gather little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil ; for your olives shall drop off .
Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far , from the end of the earth , as the eagle flies ; a nation whose language you shall not understand ;
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , Yahweh YOUR GOD ;
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Yahweh will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
these are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
you stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God ; your heads , your tribes , your elders , and your officers , even all the men of Israel ,
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law .
even all the nations shall say , " Why has Yahweh done thus to this land ? what does the heat of this great anger mean ? "
and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
the secret things belong to Yahweh our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
for this commandment which I command you this day , it is not too hard for you , neither is it far off .
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse : therefore choose life , that you may live , you and your seed ;
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , saying ,
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall condense as the dew , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the herb .
they have dealt corruptly with him . they are not his children , because of their defect . they are a perverse and crooked generation .
he found him in a desert land , in the waste howling wilderness . he surrounded him . he cared for him . he kept him as the apple of his eye .
as an eagle that stirs up her nest , that flutters over her young , he spread abroad his wings , he took them , he bore them on his feathers .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faithfulness .
for a fire is kindled in my anger , Burns to the lowest Sheol , devours the earth with its increase , and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , of the fields of Gomorrah . their grapes are grapes of gall , Their clusters are bitter .
which ate the fat of their sacrifices , And drank the wine of their drink offering ? let them rise up and help you ! let them be your protection .
if I whet my glittering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will recompense those who hate me .
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will avenge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make expiation for his land , for his people .
he said to them , " Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day , which you shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
he was king in Jeshurun , When the heads of the people were gathered , All the tribes of Israel together .
they shall teach Jacob your ordinances , and Israel your law . they shall put incense before you , and whole burnt offering on your altar .
Yahweh , bless his substance . accept the work of his hands . strike through the hips of those who rise up against him , of those who hate him , that they not rise again . "
of Benjamin he said , " The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him . he covers him all the day long . he dwells between his shoulders . "
of Naphtali he said , " Naphtali , satisfied with favor , full of the blessing of Yahweh , possess the west and the south . "
of Asher he said , " Asher is blessed with children . let him be acceptable to his brothers . let him dip his foot in oil .
" there is none like God , Jeshurun , who rides on the heavens for your help , In his excellency on the skies .
the eternal God is your dwelling place . underneath are the everlasting arms . he thrust out the enemy from before you , and said , ' Destroy ! '
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead , to Dan ,
and the South , and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees , to Zoar .
so Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of Yahweh .
the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended .
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel .
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
" remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , saying , ' Yahweh your God gives you rest , and will give you this land .
whoever rebels against your commandment , and doesn 't listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
the woman took the two men and hid them . then she said , " Yes , the men came to me , but I didn 't know where they came from .
and she said to the men , " I know that Yahweh has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
now therefore , please swear to me by Yahweh , since I have dealt kindly with you , that you also will deal kindly with my father 's house , and give me a true token ;
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
she said to them , " Go to the mountain , lest the pursuers find you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers have returned . afterward , you may go your way . "
they said to Joshua , " Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land . moreover , all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us . "
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " Come here , and hear the words of Yahweh your God . "
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people ,
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
about forty thousand men , ready and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle , to the plains of Jericho .
on that day , Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the east border of Jericho .
he spoke to the children of Israel , saying , " When your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ' What do these stones mean ? '
then you shall let your children know , saying , ' Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh , that it is mighty ; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever . ' "
at that time , Yahweh said to Joshua , " Make flint knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time . "
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circumcised by Joshua ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circumcising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal . they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho .
they ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover , in the same day .
the prince of Yahweh 's army said to Joshua , " Take your shoes off of your feet ; for the place on which you stand is holy . " Joshua did so .
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the dawning of the day , and marched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they marched around the city seven times .
it happened at the seventh time , when the priests blew the trumpets , Joshua said to the people , " Shout , for Yahweh has given you the city !
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
the men of Ai struck about thirty @-@ six men of them , and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
Joshua tore his clothes , and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening , he and the elders of Israel ; and they put dust on their heads .
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
Achan answered Joshua , and said , " I have truly sinned against Yahweh , the God of Israel , and this is what I have done .
they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day . Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger . therefore the name of that place was called " The valley of Achor " to this day .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to Ai . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
he commanded them , saying , " Behold , you shall lie in ambush against the city , behind the city . Don 't go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
and you shall rise up from the ambush , and take possession of the city ; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and killed the men of Ai .
all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of Ai .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua .
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a covenant with us . "
the men of Israel said to the Hivites , " What if you live among us . how could we make a covenant with you ? "
they said to him , " Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God ; for we have heard of his fame , all that he did in Egypt ,
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
these wineskins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel didn 't strike them , because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel . all the congregation murmured against the princes .
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they didn 't kill them .
" come up to me , and help me , and let us strike Gibeon ; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel . "
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace . none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
Joshua said to them , " Don 't be afraid , nor be dismayed . be strong and courageous , for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight . "
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
Joshua turned back at that time , and took Hazor , and struck its king with the sword : for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breathed . he burnt Hazor with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
from Mount Halak , that goes up to Seir , even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon . he took all their kings , struck them , and put them to death .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , except the Hivites , the inhabitants of Gibeon . they took all in battle .
there were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , did some remain .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . the land had rest from war .
and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth , eastward , and to the sea of the Arabah , even the Salt Sea , eastward , the way to Beth Jeshimoth ; and on the south , under the slopes of Pisgah :
and the border of Og king of Bashan , of the remnant of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
and ruled in Mount Hermon , and in Salecah , and in all Bashan , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them . Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
the king of Dor in the height of Dor , one ; the king of Goiim in Gilgal , one ;
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel didn 't drive out the Geshurites , nor the Maacathites : but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
their border was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , to Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
these are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan at Jericho , eastward .
but to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance . Yahweh , the God of Israel , is their inheritance , as he spoke to them .
by the lot of their inheritance , as Yahweh commanded by Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half @-@ tribe .
for Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half @-@ tribe beyond the Jordan ; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;
and it passed along to Azmon , went out at the brook of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . this shall be your south border .
the east border was the Salt Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward ; and the border extended to Shikkeron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out at Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
she said , " Give me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
the farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel , Eder , Jagur ,
as for the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah couldn 't drive them out ; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day .
and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites , to the border of Beth Horon the lower , even to Gezer ; and ended at the sea .
this was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families . the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar , to Beth Horon the upper .
the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north . the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh , and passed along it on the east of Janoah .
it went down from Janoah to Ataroth , to Naarah , reached to Jericho , and went out at the Jordan .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
they didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , which is before Shechem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
the land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh ; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
yet the children of Manasseh couldn 't drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , " Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance , since I am a great people , because Yahweh has blessed me so far ? "
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land , which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you ?
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
you shall survey the land into seven parts , and bring the description here to me ; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God .
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward . it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven .
it extended northward , went out at En Shemesh , and went out to Geliloth , which is over against the ascent of Adummim . it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
Zelah , Eleph , the Jebusite ( the same is Jerusalem ) , Gibeath , and Kiriath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath Beer , Ramah of the South . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families . the border of their inheritance was to Sarid .
their border went up westward , even to Maralah , and reached to Dabbesheth . it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam .
the border turned around it on the north to Hannathon ; and it ended at the valley of Iphtah El ;
the border turned to Ramah , to the fortified city of Tyre ; and the border turned to Hosah . it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib ;
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families .
me Jarkon , and Rakkon , with the border over against Joppa .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
according to the commandment of Yahweh , they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim ; and he built the city , and lived there .
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Yahweh , these cities with their suburbs .
the children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben , out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun .
but they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession .
to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Libnah with its suburbs ,
all the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country of Ephraim , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Gezer with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Hammothdor with its suburbs , and Kartan with its suburbs ; three cities .
to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of Gad , Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Mahanaim with its suburbs ,
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh ,
didn 't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel ? that man didn 't perish alone in his iniquity . ' "
for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you , you children of Reuben and children of Gad . you have no portion in Yahweh . " ' so your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh .
that Joshua called for all Israel , for their elders and for their heads , and for their judges and for their officers , and said to them , " I am old and well advanced in years .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you , as he spoke to you .
" but if you do at all go back , and hold fast to the remnant of these nations , even these who remain among you , and make marriages with them , and go in to them , and they to you ;
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave to Esau Mount Seir , to possess it . Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
" now therefore fear Yahweh , and serve him in sincerity and in truth . put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River , in Egypt ; and serve Yahweh .
Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples , even the Amorites who lived in the land . therefore we also will serve Yahweh ; for he is our God . "
Joshua said to the people , " You can 't serve Yahweh ; for he is a holy God . he is a jealous God . he will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins .
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh .
they found Adoni @-@ Bezek in Bezek ; and they fought against him , and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the lowland .
from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir . ( now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher . )
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel . ( now the name of the city before was Luz . )
the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him , " Please show us the entrance into the city , and we will deal kindly with you . "
the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Zebulun didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their altars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
therefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare to you . "
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing of it :
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years .
when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel , who saved them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
the Spirit of Yahweh came on him , and he judged Israel ; and he went out to war , and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand : and his hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he didn 't draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , when Ehud was dead .
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
I will draw to you , to the river Kishon , Sisera , the captain of Jabin 's army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into your hand . ' "
Barak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
Yahweh confused Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his army , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera alighted from his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
" Yahweh , when you went forth out of Seir , when you marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
" the kings came and fought , then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo . they took no plunder of silver .
" Jael shall be blessed above women , the wife of Heber the Kenite ; blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , until you come to Gaza , and left no sustenance in Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor donkey .
and I said to you , " I am Yahweh your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
Yahweh looked at him , and said , " Go in this your might , and save Israel from the hand of Midian . haven 't I sent you ? "
he said to him , " If now I have found favor in your sight , then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me .
please don 't go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
the angel of God said to him , " Take the meat and the unleavened cakes , and lay them on this rock , and pour out the broth . " he did so .
then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh , and called it " Yahweh is Peace . " to this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and encamped in the valley of Jezreel .
he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , ' Whoever is fearful and trembling , let him return and depart from Mount Gilead . ' " twenty @-@ two thousand of the people returned , and ten thousand remained .
it happened the same night , that Yahweh said to him , " Arise , go down into the camp ; for I have delivered it into your hand .
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
his fellow answered , " This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel . God has delivered Midian into his hand , with all the army . "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets , and empty pitchers , with torches within the pitchers .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the outermost part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
he said to them , " What have I now done in comparison with you ? isn 't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer ?
God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb ! what was I able to do in comparison with you ? " then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
the princes of Succoth said , " Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your army ? "
he went up there to Penuel , and spoke to them in the same way ; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered .
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna , " What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor ? " they answered , " They were like you . each one resembled the children of a king . "
he said to Jether his firstborn , " Get up , and kill them ! " but the youth didn 't draw his sword ; for he was afraid , because he was yet a youth .
Gideon said to them , " I would make a request of you , that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil . " ( for they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites . )
Gideon made an ephod of it , and put it in his city , even in Ophrah : and all Israel played the prostitute after it there ; and it became a snare to Gideon , and to his house .
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , Gideon , according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel .
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
" now therefore , if you have dealt truly and righteously , in that you have made Abimelech king , and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands
( for my father fought for you , and risked his life , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
Abimelech rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it , they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith .
Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads : and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim .
they troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year . for eighteen years , they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was very distressed .
the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , saying , " We have sinned against you , even because we have forsaken our God , and have served the Baals . "
the Sidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , oppressed you ; and you cried to me , and I saved you out of their hand .
the children of Israel said to Yahweh , " We have sinned : do you to us whatever seems good to you ; only deliver us , please , this day . "
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Yahweh ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpah .
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
and they said to Jephthah , " Come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of Ammon . "
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , " If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon , and Yahweh deliver them before me , shall I be your head ? "
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Yahweh shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea , and came to Kadesh ;
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said to him , ' Please let us pass through your land to my place . '
so now Yahweh , the God of Israel , has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel , and should you possess them ?
now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ?
I therefore have not sinned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yahweh , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon . "
however the king of the children of Ammon didn 't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand ,
he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith , even twenty cities , and to Abelcheramim , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
Jephthah said to them , " I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , you didn 't save me out of their hand .
Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the hill country of the Amalekites .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and didn 't bear .
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " What is your name , that when your words happen , we may honor you ? "
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
but the angel of Yahweh didn 't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more . then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
his father went down to the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
he said to them , " Out of the eater came forth food . out of the strong came forth sweetness . " they couldn 't in three days declare the riddle .
her father said , " I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to your companion . isn 't her younger sister more beautiful than she ? please take her , instead . "
Samson said to them , " If you behave like this , surely I will be avenged of you , and after that I will cease . "
the men of Judah said , " Why have you come up against us ? " they said , " We have come up to bind Samson , to do to him as he has done to us . "
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
Samson said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
Delilah said to Samson , " Behold , you have mocked me , and told me lies : now please tell me with which you might be bound . "
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
she fastened it with the pin , and said to him , " The Philistines are on you , Samson ! " he awakened out of his sleep , and plucked away the pin of the beam , and the web .
the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women , who saw while Samson performed .
then his brothers and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father . he judged Israel twenty years .
then Micah said , " Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me , since I have a Levite to my priest . "
he said to them , " Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me , and he has hired me , and I am become his priest . "
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
his concubine played the prostitute against him , and went away from him to her father 's house to Bethlehem Judah , and was there the space of four months .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , to Yahweh at Mizpah .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , " What wickedness is this that is happen among you ?
the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty @-@ six thousand men who drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , who were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
the children of Israel asked of Yahweh ( for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar : and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place , even out of Maareh Geba .
Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty @-@ five thousand one hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , why has this happened in Israel , that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel ? "
it happened on the next day that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
how shall we provide wives for those who remain , since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ? "
the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant , and commanded them , saying , " Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the little ones .
this is the thing that you shall do : you shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman who has lain with a man . "
the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon , and proclaimed peace to them .
the people grieved for Benjamin , because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
they said , " There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , " Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they lived there about ten years .
they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother @-@ in @-@ law , but Ruth joined with her .
she said , " Behold , your sister @-@ in @-@ law has gone back to her people , and to her god . follow your sister @-@ in @-@ law . "
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Naomi ? "
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech , and his name was Boaz .
she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , " Yahweh be with you . " they answered him , " Yahweh bless you . "
then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers , " Whose young lady is this ? "
she said , ' Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves . ' so she came , and has continued even from the morning until now , except that she stayed a little in the house . "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
also pull out some for her from the bundles , and leave it , and let her glean , and don 't rebuke her . "
so she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz , to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Naomi her mother @-@ in @-@ law said to her , " My daughter , shall I not seek rest for you , that it may be well with you ?
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
it happened at midnight , that the man was startled and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
she said , " He gave me these six measures of barley ; for he said , ' Don 't go empty to your mother @-@ in @-@ law . ' "
then she said , " Sit still , my daughter , until you know how the matter will fall ; for the man will not rest , until he has finished the thing this day . "
he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , " Sit down here . " they sat down .
so the near kinsman said to Boaz , " Buy it for yourself . " he took off his shoe .
the women said to Naomi , " Blessed be Yahweh , who has not left you this day without a near kinsman ; and let his name be famous in Israel .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Naomi " ; and they named him Obed . he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh . the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , priests to Yahweh , were there .
but to Hannah he gave a double portion ; for he loved Hannah , but Yahweh had shut up her womb .
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yahweh , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and didn 't eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh 's temple .
Eli said to her , " How long will you be drunken ? put away your wine from you . "
Don 't count your handmaid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
it happened , when the time had come , that Hannah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Yahweh . "
the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
but Hannah didn 't go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yahweh , and stay there forever . "
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh . as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh . " he worshiped Yahweh there .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don 't let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Yahweh is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a fork of three teeth in his hand ;
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
the man of yours , whom I shall not cut off from my altar , shall consume your eyes , and grieve your heart ; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he didn 't restrain them .
therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Eli 's house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever . "
then Eli called Samuel , and said , " Samuel , my son ! " he said , " Here I am . "
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
woe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
be strong , and behave like men , O you Philistines , that you not be servants to the Hebrews , as they have been to you . strengthen yourselves like men , and fight ! "
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any who come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod , to this day .
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , " What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no yoke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
the men of Beth Shemesh said , " Who is able to stand before Yahweh , this holy God ? to whom shall he go up from us ? "
when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and struck them , until they came under Beth Kar .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abijah : they were judges in Beersheba .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
you shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you ; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day . "
but the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel ; and they said , " No ; but we will have a king over us ,
that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles . "
Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
then Saul said to his servant , " Well said . come , let us go . " so they went to the city where the man of God was .
as they went up the ascent to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said to them , " Is the seer here ? "
when Samuel saw Saul , Yahweh said to him , " Behold , the man of whom I spoke to you ! this same shall have authority over my people . "
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , " Please tell me where the seer 's house is . "
then Samuel took the vial of oil , and poured it on his head , and kissed him , and said , " isn 't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance ?
and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you , and you shall prophesy with them , and shall be turned into another man .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
when they came there to the hill , behold , a band of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him , and he prophesied among them .
Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , " Where did you go ? " he said , " To seek the donkeys . when we saw that they were not found , we came to Samuel . "
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then Nahash the Ammonite came up , and encamped against Jabesh Gilead : and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash , " Make a covenant with us , and we will serve you . "
behold , Saul came following the oxen out of the field ; and Saul said , " What ails the people that they weep ? " they told him the words of the men of Jabesh .
he numbered them in Bezek ; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , " Tomorrow we will come out to you , and you shall do with us all that seems good to you . "
the people said to Samuel , " Who is he who said , ' Shall Saul reign over us ? ' bring those men , that we may put them to death ! "
Saul said , " There shall not a man be put to death this day ; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel . "
all the people went to Gilgal ; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal ; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly .
he said to them , " Yahweh is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that you have not found anything in my hand . " they said , " He is witness . "
Samuel said to the people , " It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
" when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yahweh your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Yahweh has set a king over you .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
all the people said to Samuel , " Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God , that we not die ; for we have added to all our sins this evil , to ask us a king . "
for Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba : and the Philistines heard of it . Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , " Let the Hebrews hear ! "
all Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines , and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines . the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
Samuel said to Saul , " You have done foolishly . you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God , which he commanded you ; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever .
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel ; for the Philistines said , " Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears " ;
Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people who were with him were about six hundred men ;
and Ahijah , the son of Ahitub , Ichabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . the people didn 't know that Jonathan was gone .
his armor bearer said to him , " Do all that is in your heart . turn and , behold , I am with you according to your heart . "
but if they say this , ' Come up to us ! ' then we will go up ; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand . this shall be the sign to us . "
both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , " Behold , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled ; and the earth quaked : so there was an exceeding great trembling .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
Saul said to Ahijah , " Bring the ark of God here . " for the ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time .
then Jonathan said , " My father has troubled the land . please look how my eyes have been enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey .
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
Saul asked counsel of God , " Shall I go down after the Philistines ? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel ? " but he didn 't answer him that day .
Saul said , " Draw near here , all you chiefs of the people ; and know and see in which this sin has been this day .
he did valiantly , and struck the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
Samuel said to Saul , " Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people , over Israel . now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , ' I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Samuel said , " Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears , and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean ? "
Saul said , " They have brought them from the Amalekites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Yahweh your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
then Samuel said to Saul , " Stay , and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night . " he said to him , " Say on . "
Samuel said , " Though you were little in your own sight , weren 't you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel ;
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh , and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
then Samuel said , " Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites ! " Agag came to him cheerfully . Agag said , " Surely the bitterness of death is past . "
Samuel said , " How can I go ? if Saul hears it , he will kill me . " Yahweh said , " Take a heifer with you , and say , I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh .
he said , " peaceably ; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh . sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . " he sanctified Jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
it happened , when they had come , that he looked at Eliab , and said , " Surely Yahweh 's anointed is before him . "
then Jesse made Shammah to pass by . he said , " Neither has Yahweh chosen this one . "
then Samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
it happened , when the spirit from God was on Saul , that David took the harp , and played with his hand : so Saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle ; and they were gathered together at Socoh , which belongs to Judah , and encamped between Socoh and Azekah , in Ephesdammim .
the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and his shield bearer went before him .
the Philistine said , " I defy the armies of Israel this day ! give me a man , that we may fight together ! "
Jesse said to David his son , " Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain , and these ten loaves , and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers ;
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
David said to Saul , " Your servant was keeping his father 's sheep ; and when a lion or a bear came , and took a lamb out of the flock ,
when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and withal of a fair face .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
Saul was very angry , and this saying displeased him ; and he said , " They have ascribed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands . what can he have more but the kingdom ? "
and Saul threw the spear ; for he said , " I will pin David even to the wall ! " David escaped from his presence twice .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
but it happened at the time when Merab , Saul 's daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
when the messengers came in , behold , the teraphim was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
then went he also to Ramah , and came to the great well that is in Secu : and he asked , " Where are Samuel and David ? " one said , " Behold , they are at Naioth in Ramah . "
he also stripped off his clothes , and he also prophesied before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . therefore they say , " Is Saul also among the prophets ? "
then Jonathan said to David , " Whatever your soul desires , I will even do it for you . "
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
you shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh , that I not die ;
Jonathan caused David to swear again , for the love that he had to him ; for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started , and shall remain by the stone Ezel .
but if I say this to the boy , ' Behold , the arrows are beyond you ; ' then go your way ; for Yahweh has sent you away .
nevertheless Saul didn 't say anything that day : for he thought , " Something has happened to him . he is not clean . surely he is not clean . "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don 't delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
now therefore what is under your hand ? give me five loaves of bread in my hand , or whatever there is present . "
the priest answered David , and said , " There is no common bread under my hand , but there is holy bread ; if only the young men have kept themselves from women . "
so the priest gave him holy bread ; for there was no bread there but the show bread , that was taken from before Yahweh , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
he changed his behavior before them , and pretended to be mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down on his beard .
then Achish said to his servants , " Look , you see the man is mad . why then have you brought him to me ?
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Adullam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was discontented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
the prophet Gad said to David , " Don 't stay in the stronghold . depart , and go into the land of Judah . " then David departed , and came into the forest of Hereth .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
the king said to Doeg , " Turn and attack the priests ! " Doeg the Edomite turned , and he attacked the priests , and he killed on that day eighty @-@ five people who wore a linen ephod .
David was told , " Behold , the Philistines are fighting against Keilah , and are robbing the threshing floors . "
David 's men said to him , " Behold , we are afraid here in Judah : how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ? "
then David inquired of Yahweh yet again . Yahweh answered him , and said , " Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand . "
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . Saul said , " God has delivered him into my hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that has gates and bars . "
then David said , " O Yahweh , the God of Israel , your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
then David said , " Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? " Yahweh said , " They will deliver you up . "
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . Saul sought him every day , but God didn 't deliver him into his hand .
they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah on the south of the desert .
but a messenger came to Saul , saying , " Hurry and come ; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land ! "
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " Behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
David swore to Saul . Saul went home ; but David and his men went up to the stronghold .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my shearers , and give it to men who I don 't know where they come from ? "
now therefore know and consider what you will do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his house ; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can 't speak to him . "
it was so , as she rode on her donkey , and came down by the covert of the mountain , that behold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
now David had said , " Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him . he has returned me evil for good .
when Abigail saw David , she hurried , and alighted from her donkey , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
David said to Abigail , " Blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me !
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " Behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Abigail hurried , and arose , and rode on a donkey , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David said to Abishai , " Don 't destroy him ; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh 's anointed , and be guiltless ? "
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of the mountain afar off ; a great space being between them ;
and David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , " Don 't you answer , Abner ? " then Abner answered , " Who are you who cries to the king ? "
Saul knew David 's voice , and said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " David said , " It is my voice , my lord , O king . "
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
then Saul said to David , " You are blessed , my son David . you shall both do mightily , and shall surely prevail . " so David went his way , and Saul returned to his place .
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
Achish believed David , saying , " He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him . therefore he shall be my servant forever . "
Saul swore to her by Yahweh , saying , " As Yahweh lives , no punishment shall happen to you for this thing . "
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , and didn 't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek , therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day .
moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines . "
then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth , and was terrified , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
the woman had a fattened calf in the house . she hurried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread of it .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
Achish answered David , " I know that you are good in my sight , as an angel of God . notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , ' He shall not go up with us to the battle . '
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they didn 't kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
so David went , he and the six hundred men who were with him , and came to the brook Besor , where those who were left behind stayed .
but David pursued , he and four hundred men ; for two hundred stayed behind , who were so faint that they couldn 't go over the brook Besor .
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage : they shall share alike . "
when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , " Behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh . "
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
he said to me , ' Please stand beside me , and kill me ; for anguish has taken hold of me , because my life is yet whole in me . '
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
David said to him , " How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh 's anointed ? "
Don 't tell it in Gath . Don 't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon , lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swifter than eagles . they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " Blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them . "
now Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's army , had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and he reigned two years . but the house of Judah followed David .
Abner said to Joab , " Please let the young men arise and play before us ! " Joab said , " Let them arise ! "
then they arose and went over by number : twelve for Benjamin , and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
the battle was very severe that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
then Abner looked behind him , and said , " Is it you , Asahel ? " he answered , " It is I. "
but Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one band , and stood on the top of a hill .
Joab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
so Joab blew the trumpet ; and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and came to Mahanaim .
Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
they took up Asahel , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Joab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at Hebron .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and the sixth , Ithream , of Eglah , David 's wife . these were born to David in Hebron .
David sent messengers to Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , saying , " Deliver me my wife Michal , whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines . "
her husband went with her , weeping as he went , and followed her to Bahurim . then Abner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
when Joab and all the army who was with him had come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
you know Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
afterward , when David heard it , he said , " I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
they buried Abner in Hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
the king said to his servants , " Don 't you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel ?
David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said to them , " As Yahweh lives , who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron , and spoke , saying , " Behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stronghold .
David came to Baal Perazim , and David struck them there ; and he said , " Yahweh has broken my enemies before me , like the breach of waters . " therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim .
they set the ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon , Uzzah reached for the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stumbled .
David was afraid of Yahweh that day ; and he said , " How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me ? "
the ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite three months : and Yahweh blessed Obed @-@ Edom , and all his house .
they brought in the ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
David said to Michal , " It was before Yahweh , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh .
I will be yet more vile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
it happened , when the king lived in his house , and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around ,
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men ;
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
for you , Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , even eighteen thousand men .
David said , " Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul , that I may show him kindness for Jonathan 's sake ? "
Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , came to David , and fell on his face , and showed respect . David said , " Mephibosheth . " he answered , " Behold , your servant ! "
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
Hadadezer sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Helam , with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers , and forty thousand horsemen , and struck Shobach the captain of their army , so that he died there .
David sent and inquired after the woman . one said , " isn 't this Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ? "
the woman conceived ; and she sent and told David , and said , " I am with child . "
David said to Uriah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and didn 't go down to his house .
the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab . some of the people fell , even of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for .
the messenger said to David , " The men prevailed against us , and came out to us into the field , and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate .
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . "
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it ; lest I take the city , and it be called after my name . "
she answered him , " No , my brother , do not force me ! for no such thing ought to be done in Israel . Don 't you do this folly .
I , where would I carry my shame ? and as for you , you will be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , please speak to the king ; for he will not withhold me from you . "
then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . Amnon said to her , " Arise , be gone ! "
she said to him , " Not so , because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me ! " but he would not listen to her .
then he called his servant who ministered to him , and said , " Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don 't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead . "
King David longed to go forth to Absalom : for he was comforted concerning Amnon , since he was dead .
when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , showed respect , and said , " Help , O king ! "
your handmaid had two sons , and they both fought together in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other , and killed him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
the king said to Joab , " Behold now , I have done this thing . go therefore , bring the young man Absalom back . "
the king said , " Let him return to his own house , but let him not see my face . " so Absalom returned to his own house , and didn 't see the king 's face .
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
then Joab arose , and came to Absalom to his house , and said to him , " Why have your servants set my field on fire ? "
so Joab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to Yahweh , in Hebron .
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
a messenger came to David , saying , " The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom . "
the king 's servants said to the king , " Behold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses . "
the king said to Zadok , " Carry back the ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his habitation ;
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
then the king said to Ziba , " Behold , all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours . " Ziba said , " I do obeisance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
Shimei said when he cursed , " Be gone , be gone , you man of blood , and base fellow !
then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , " Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? please let me go over and take off his head . "
Absalom , and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
it happened , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , had come to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
Hushai said to Absalom , " No ; but whomever Yahweh , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
and I will bring back all the people to you . the man whom you seek is as if all returned . all the people shall be in peace . "
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
but I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that you go to battle in your own person .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
but a boy saw them , and told Absalom . then they both went away quickly , and came to the house of a man in Bahurim , who had a well in his court ; and they went down there .
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
it happened , when David had come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim ,
the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom .
so the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim .
a certain man saw it , and told Joab , and said , " Behold , I saw Absalom hanging in an oak . "
Joab said to the man who told him , " Behold , you saw it , and why didn 't you strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver , and a sash . "
otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
then Joab said to the Cushite , " Go , tell the king what you have seen ! " the Cushite bowed himself to Joab , and ran .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain , and outran the Cushite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watchman said , " I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . " the king said , " He is a good man , and comes with good news . "
the king said , " Turn aside , and stand here . " he turned aside , and stood still .
the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , " My son Absalom , Absalom , my son , my son ! "
Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why don 't you speak a word of bringing the king back ? "
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
a ferry boat went to bring over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king , when he had come over the Jordan .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
he has slandered your servant to my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God . do therefore what is good in your eyes .
Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim ; and he went over the Jordan with the king , to conduct him over the Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
the king said to Barzillai , " Come over with me , and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gilgal , and Chimham went over with him . all the people of Judah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
then the king said to Amasa , " Call me the men of Judah together within three days , and be here present . "
there stood by him one of Joab 's young men , and said , " He who favors Joab , and he who is for David , let him follow Joab ! "
he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth Maacah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then a wise woman cried out of the city , " Hear , hear ! please say to Joab , ' Come near here , that I may speak with you . ' "
I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel . you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel . why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh ? "
and David said to the Gibeonites , " What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make atonement , that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh ? "
they said to the king , " The man who consumed us , and who devised against us , that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel ,
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us , and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul , the chosen of Yahweh . " the king said , " I will give them . "
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
there was again war with the Philistines at GOB ; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite 's brother , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
these four were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my savior , you save me from violence .
he rode on a cherub , and flew . yes , he was seen on the wings of the wind .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me , for they were too mighty for me .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righteously , who rules in the fear of God ,
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite , against eight hundred slain at one time .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh worked a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David longed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he moved David against them , saying , " Go , number Israel and Judah . "
they passed over the Jordan , and encamped in Aroer , on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad , and to Jazer :
" go and speak to David , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
Gad came that day to David , and said to him , " Go up , build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite . "
Araunah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . so Yahweh was entreated for the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
so they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel , and found Abishag the Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
the young lady was very beautiful ; and she cherished the king , and ministered to him ; but the king didn 't know her intimately .
his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Absalom .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth , which is beside En Rogel ; and he called all his brothers , the king 's sons , and all the men of Judah , the king 's servants :
Bathsheba went in to the king into the room . the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king .
Bathsheba bowed , and showed respect to the king . the king said , " What would you like ? "
she said to him , " My lord , you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne . '
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders . "
the king swore , and said , " As Yahweh lives , who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and showed respect to the king , and said , " Let my lord king David live forever ! "
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
as Yahweh has been with my lord the king , even so may he be with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David . "
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent , and anointed Solomon . they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , " Long live king Solomon ! "
all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
while he yet spoke , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said , " Come in ; for you are a worthy man , and bring good news . "
the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mule .
Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon . they have come up from there rejoicing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that you have heard .
also thus said the king , ' Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
Solomon said , " If he shows himself a worthy man , not a hair of him shall fall to the earth ; but if wickedness be found in him , he shall die . "
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . he came and bowed down to king Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , " Go to your house . "
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
do therefore according to your wisdom , and don 't let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace .
but show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those who eat at your table ; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother .
now I ask one petition of you . Don 't deny me . " she said to him , " Say on . "
he said , " Please speak to Solomon the king ( for he will not tell you ' no ' ) , that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife . "
then she said , " I ask one small petition of you ; don 't deny me . " the king said to her , " Ask on , my mother ; for I will not deny you . "
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh , that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh , which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army ; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar .
the king sent and called for Shimei , and said to him , " Build yourself a house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and don 't go out from there anywhere .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
Shimei said to the king , " The saying is good . as my lord the king has said , so will your servant do . " Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days .
why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh , and the commandment that I have instructed you with ? "
the king said moreover to Shimei , " You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head .
only the people sacrificed in the high places , because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days .
in Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night ; and God said , " Ask what I shall give you . "
behold , I have done according to your word . behold , I have given you a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there has been none like you before you , neither after you shall any arise like you .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
the king said , " Get me a sword . " they brought a sword before the king .
all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do justice .
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers ; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister , the king 's friend ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merry .
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and roebucks , and fattened fowl .
those officers provided food for king Solomon , and for all who came to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month ; they let nothing be lacking .
barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were , every man according to his duty .
there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , who had heard of his wisdom .
Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , " I have heard the message which you have sent to me . I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
the king commanded , and they cut out great stones , costly stones , to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone .
Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders and the Gebalites cut them , and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar .
he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling : he built them for it within , for an oracle , even for the most holy place .
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh .
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in its height ; and he overlaid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
the whole house he overlaid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and two doors of fir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers ; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work .
for he built the house of the forest of Lebanon ; its length was one hundred cubits , and its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits , on four rows of cedar pillars , with cedar beams on the pillars .
he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of cedar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh , and the porch of the house .
there were nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
so he made the pillars ; and there were two rows around on the one network , to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars : and he did so for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the ledges ;
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubim ; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
there were four supports at the four corners of each base : its supports were of the base itself .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
Hiram made the basins , and the shovels , and the basins . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh :
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hiram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yahweh , were of burnished brass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh : the golden altar , and the table whereupon the show bread was , of gold ;
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
they brought up the ark of Yahweh , and the Tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent ; even these the priests and the Levites brought up .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh .
he said , " Blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set a place for the ark , in which is the covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant , and to the supplication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh , he is God . there is none else .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yahweh and the king 's house
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her : then he built Millo .
Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh three times a year , burning incense with them , on the altar that was before Yahweh . so he finished the house .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
Hiram sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
blessed is Yahweh your God , who delighted in you , to set you on the throne of Israel . because Yahweh loved Israel forever , therefore made he you king , to do justice and righteousness . "
she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones . there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , that he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in droves , each drove at a price .
now king Solomon loved many foreign women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Sidonians , and Hittites ;
then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he didn 't keep that which Yahweh commanded .
notwithstanding I will not do it in your days , for David your father 's sake ; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon , hadad the Edomite : he was of the king 's seed in Edom .
for it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain , and had struck every male in Edom
hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam ; but Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . ' "
so Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king asked , saying , " Come to me again the third day . "
the king answered the people roughly , and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him ,
then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and lived in it ; and he went out from there , and built Penuel .
he made houses of high places , and made priests from among all the people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
he gave a sign the same day , saying , " This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken : behold , the altar will be split apart , and the ashes that are on it will be poured out . "
the king said to the man of God , " Come home with me , and refresh yourself , and I will give you a reward . "
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
their father said to them , " Which way did he go ? " now his sons had seen which way the man of God went , who came from Judah .
he said to his sons , " Saddle the donkey for me . " so they saddled the donkey for him ; and he rode on it .
for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back ;
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
he laid his body in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , " Alas , my brother ! "
go , tell Jeroboam , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " because I exalted you from among the people , and made you prince over my people Israel ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam . this is day ! what ? even now .
and there were also sodomites in the land : they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel .
it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ;
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and his mother 's name was Naamah the Ammonitess . Abijam his son reigned in his place .
now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah .
nevertheless for David 's sake , Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem ;
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
he put away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and Asa cut down her image , and burnt it at the brook Kidron .
he brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben hadad listened to king Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him . now he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household in Tirzah :
and Zimri went in and struck him , and killed him , in the twenty @-@ seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
for all the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , which they sinned , and with which they made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
in the twenty @-@ seventh year of Asa king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah . now the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and dealt wickedly above all who were before him .
" go away from here , turn eastward , and hide yourself by the brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
so he went and did according to the word of Yahweh ; for he went and lived by the brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
the jar of meal didn 't empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Elijah .
he stretched himself on the child three times , and cried to Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh my God , please let this child 's soul come into him again . "
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " Behold , your son lives . "
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
now you say , ' Go , tell your lord , " Behold , Elijah is here " ; ' and he will kill me . "
Elijah said , " As Yahweh of Armies lives , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself to him today . "
it happened , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said to him , " Is that you , you troubler of Israel ? "
he answered , " I have not troubled Israel ; but you , and your father 's house , in that you have forsaken the commandments of Yahweh , and you have followed the Baals .
Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
with the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh . he made a trench around the altar , large enough to contain two measures of seed .
then the fire of Yahweh fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Yahweh , he is God ! Yahweh , he is God ! "
Elijah said to them , " Seize the prophets of Baal ! Don 't let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon , and killed them there .
Elijah said to Ahab , " Get up , eat and drink ; for there is the sound of abundance of rain . "
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
he said to his servant , " Go up now , look toward the sea . " he went up , and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " he said , " Go again " seven times .
the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah ; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
he lay down and slept under a juniper tree ; and behold , an angel touched him , and said to him , " Arise and eat ! "
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the coals , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
the angel of Yahweh came again the second time , and touched him , and said , " Arise and eat , because the journey is too great for you . "
he came there to a cave , and lodged there ; and behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , and he said to him , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
Yahweh said to him , " Go , return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus . when you arrive , you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria .
Ben hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together ; and there were thirty @-@ two kings with him , and horses and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and fought against it .
the king of Israel answered , " It is according to your saying , my lord , O king . I am yours , and all that I have . "
the messengers came again , and said , " Ben hadad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wives , and your children ;
Ben hadad sent to him , and said , " The gods do so to me , and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me . "
he said , " If they have come out for peace , take them alive ; or if they have come out for war , take them alive . "
but the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @-@ seven thousand men who were left . Ben hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh , " Please strike me ! " the man refused to strike him .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
he hurried , and took the headband away from his eyes ; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets .
it happened after these things , that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard , which was in Jezreel , hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria .
Naboth said to Ahab , " May Yahweh forbid me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you ! "
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
Ahab said to Elijah , " Have you found me , my enemy ? " he answered , " I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh .
Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel , saying , " The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel .
the dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
he did very abominably in following idols , according to all that the Amorites did , whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
the king of Israel said to his servants , " You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours , and we are still , and don 't take it out of the hand of the king of Syria ? "
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
all the prophets prophesied so , saying , " Go up to Ramoth Gilead , and prosper ; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king . "
the king said to him , " How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh ? "
now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son .
say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace . " ' "
Micaiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Yahweh has not spoken by me . " he said , " Listen , all you people ! "
the battle increased that day . the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians , and died at evening . the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot .
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
Jehoshaphat was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
the remnant of the sodomites , that remained in the days of his father Asa , he put away out of the land .
he served Baal , and worshiped him , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
now therefore thus says Yahweh , " You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but shall surely die . " ' " Elijah departed .
the messengers returned to him , and he said to them , " Why is it that you have returned ? "
he said to them , " What kind of man was he who came up to meet you , and told you these words ? "
they answered him , " He was a hairy man , and wearing a leather belt around his waist . " he said , " It is Elijah the Tishbite . "
again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty . he answered him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down quickly ! ' "
the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah , " Go down with him . Don 't be afraid of him . " he arose , and went down with him to the king .
fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood opposite them at a distance ; and they both stood by the Jordan .
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
they came back to him , while he stayed at Jericho ; and he said to them , " didn 't I tell you , ' Don 't go ? ' "
he said , " Bring me a new jar , and put salt in it . " they brought it to him .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs , and of one hundred thousand rams .
the king of Israel said , " Alas ! for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab . "
Jehoshaphat said , " The word of Yahweh is with him . " so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
but now bring me a minstrel . " it happened , when the minstrel played , that the hand of Yahweh came on him .
you shall strike every fortified city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all springs of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ' "
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
Elisha said to her , " What shall I do for you ? tell me : what do you have in the house ? " she said , " Your handmaid has nothing in the house , except a pot of oil . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
he said , " What then is to be done for her ? " Gehazi answered , " Most certainly she has no son , and her husband is old . "
when the child was grown , it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers .
he said , " Why would you want go to him today ? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath . " she said , " It 's alright . "
the mother of the child said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " he arose , and followed her .
he called Gehazi , and said , " Call this Shunammite ! " so he called her . when she had come in to him , he said , " Take up your son . "
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
so he set it before them , and they ate , and left some of it , according to the word of Yahweh .
Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
aren 't Abanah and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? couldn 't I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . when Naaman saw one running after him , he came down from the chariot to meet him , and said , " Is all well ? "
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . Elisha said to him , " Where did you come from , Gehazi ? " he said , " Your servant went nowhere . "
the sons of the prophets said to Elisha , " See now , the place where we dwell before you is too small for us .
therefore he sent horses , chariots , and a great army there . they came by night , and surrounded the city .
when they came down to him , Elisha prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
he said , " If Yahweh doesn 't help you , from where could I help you ? from of the threshing floor , or from the winepress ? "
while he was still talking with them , behold , the messenger came down to him . then he said , " Behold , this evil is from Yahweh . why should I wait for Yahweh any longer ? "
now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate . they said one to another , " Why do we sit here until we die ?
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
the people went out , and plundered the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of Yahweh .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , " Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done . "
it happened on the next day , that he took a thick cloth , dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Hazael reigned in his place .
in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
twenty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when you come there , find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
then they hurried , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew the trumpet , saying , " Jehu is king . "
it happened , when Joram saw Jehu , that he said , " Is it peace , Jehu ? " he answered , " What peace , so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound ? "
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
when he had come in , he ate and drink ; and he said , " See now to this cursed woman , and bury her ; for she is a king 's daughter . "
now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , to the rulers of Jezreel , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab , saying ,
but they were exceedingly afraid , and said , " Behold , the two kings didn 't stand before him ! how then shall we stand ? "
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh , which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab . for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
Jehu gathered all the people together , and said to them , " Ahab served Baal a little ; but Jehu will serve him much .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
from the Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , even Gilead and Bashan .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
in the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah of Beersheba .
however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;
moreover they didn 't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the trespass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Yahweh : it was the priests ' .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
he said , " Take the arrows " ; and he took them . he said to the king of Israel , " Strike the ground " ; and he struck three times , and stopped .
Elisha died , and they buried him . now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen . so Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
for Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any helper for Israel .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty @-@ ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned for a month in Samaria .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and struck him , and killed him , and reigned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places . he built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh .
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria listened to him ; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried its people captive to Kir , and killed Rezin .
Urijah the priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger ;
and they served idols , of which Yahweh had said to them , " You shall not do this thing . "
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
for he tore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh , and made them sin a great sin .
so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they didn 't fear Yahweh : therefore Yahweh sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared Yahweh , and served their own gods , after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away .
but you shall fear Yahweh your God ; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies . "
now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
he trusted in Yahweh , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among them that were before him .
at the end of three years they took it : in the sixth year of Hezekiah , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah , and took them .
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Say now to Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
but the people held their peace , and answered him not a word ; for the king 's commandment was , " Don 't answer him . "
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
incline your ear , Yahweh , and hear . open your eyes , Yahweh , and see . hear the words of Sennacherib , with which he has sent to defy the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us , I beg you , out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you , Yahweh , are God alone . "
then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria , I have heard you .
this is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him : " the virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt . '
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day ? "
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
Hezekiah answered , " It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps . nay , but let the shadow return backward ten steps . "
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hephzibah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
to the carpenters , and to the builders , and to the masons , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house .
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , " Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me . " Shaphan read it before the king .
the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' Behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
nevertheless the priests of the high places didn 't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem , but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers .
he said , " Let him be ! let no man move his bones . " so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria .
the king commanded all the people , saying , " Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God , as it is written in this book of the covenant . "
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ,
and also for the innocent blood that he shed ; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood : and Yahweh would not pardon .
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his father had done .
all the men of might , even seven thousand , and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand , all of them strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
the king of Babylon made Mattaniah , Jehoiachin 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
for through the anger of Yahweh , it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
he burnt the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
but the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields .
the Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh , and carried the brass pieces to Babylon .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .

in Jerusalem lived of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin , and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh :
and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham , and Elah the son of Uzzi , the son of Michri , and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah , the son of Reuel , the son of Ibnijah ;
and their brothers , according to their generations , nine hundred fifty @-@ six . all these men were heads of fathers ' households by their fathers ' houses .

of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , of the sons of Merari ;
who previously served in the king 's gate eastward : they were the porters for the camp of the children of Levi .
all these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust .
for the four chief porters , who were Levites , were in an office of trust , and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in God 's house .
certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service ; for by count were these brought in and by count were these taken out .
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
Azel had six sons , whose names are these : Azrikam , Bocheru , and Ishmael , and Sheariah , and Obadiah , and Hanan : these were the sons of Azel .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
so Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh , because of the word of Yahweh , which he didn 't keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inquire ,
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , the son of a Hachmonite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time .
he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
they stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David longed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
behold , he was more honorable than the thirty , but he didn 't attain to the three : and David set him over his guard .
Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Berothite , the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah ,
now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish ; and they were among the mighty men , his helpers in war .
the chief was Ahiezer ; then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth , and Beracah , and Jehu the Anathothite ,
and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Jozabad the Gederathite ,
they helped David against the band of rovers : for they were all mighty men of valor , and were captains in the army .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father 's house twenty @-@ two captains .
of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , who were mentioned by name , to come and make David king .
of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us . for we didn 't seek it in the days of Saul . "
so David assembled all Israel together , from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath , to bring the ark of God from Kiriath jearim .
David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , and with harps , and with stringed instruments , and with tambourines , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
the ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ Edom in his house three months : and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed @-@ Edom , and all that he had .
these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
David inquired of God , saying , " Shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to him , " Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . "
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
then David said , " No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites . for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God , and to minister to him forever . "
the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with stringed instruments set to Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed lyre , to lead .
Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was over the song : he instructed about the song , because he was skillful .
it happened , when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams .
they brought in the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
Oh give thanks to Yahweh . call on his name . make his doings known among the peoples .
he confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant ,
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ! let them say among the nations , " Yahweh reigns ! "
say , " Save us , God of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . "
blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting . all the people said , " Amen , " and praised Yahweh .
so he left there , before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
and Zadok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
and with them heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
" go and tell David my servant , ' Thus says Yahweh , " You shall not build me a house to dwell in ;
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , " Who am I , Yahweh God , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
what can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant .
Yahweh , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
David took from him one thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
from Tibhath and from Cun , cities of Hadadezer , David took very much brass , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captain of the army .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
these were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David said to Joab and to the princes of the people , " Go , number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan ; and bring me word , that I may know the sum of them . "
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let me fall , I pray , into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
but David couldn 't go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever . '
may Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed .
now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn 't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
for by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered , from twenty years old and upward .
and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the Sabbaths , on the new moons , and on the set feasts , in number according to the ordinance concerning them , continually before Yahweh ;
these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron : Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
of the rest of the sons of Levi : of the sons of Amram , Shubael ; of the sons of Shubael , Jehdeiah .
of Jeduthun ; the sons of Jeduthun : Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp , who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
they cast lots for their offices , all alike , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholar .
for the divisions of the doorkeepers : of the Korahites , Meshelemiah the son of Kore , of the sons of Asaph .
Obed @-@ Edom had sons : Shemaiah the firstborn , Jehozabad the second , Joah the third , and Sacar the fourth , and Nethanel the fifth ,
also to Shemaiah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were mighty men of valor .
the sons of Shemaiah : Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brothers were valiant men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yahweh .
of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brothers , men of valor , one thousand seven hundred , had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward , for all the business of Yahweh , and for the service of the king .
over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite , and his division ; and Mikloth the ruler : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada the priest , chief : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh in Gilead , Iddo the son of Zechariah : of Benjamin , Jaasiel the son of Abner :
of Dan , Azarel the son of Jeroham . these were the captains of the tribes of Israel .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but didn 't finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David .
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
also Jonathan , David 's uncle , was a counselor , a man of understanding , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar : and the captain of the king 's army was Joab .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
take heed now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary . be strong , and do it . "
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the forks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot , the cherubim , that spread out , and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Yahweh your God ! " all the assembly blessed Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king .
all the princes , the mighty men , and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
but David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath jearim to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh , which was at the Tent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the Tent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he reigned over Israel .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue ; the king 's merchants purchased them from Kue .
but who is able to build him a house , since heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain him ? who am I then , that I should build him a house , except just to burn incense before him ?
" send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon : and behold , my servants shall be with your servants ,
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @-@ three thousand six hundred .
he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens , and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the porch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
the greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood , which he overlaid with fine gold , and ornamented it with palm trees and chains .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work ; and they overlaid them with gold .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @-@ five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
he made chains in the oracle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
then he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits its length , and twenty cubits its breadth , and ten cubits its height .
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basins . so Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in God 's house , the golden altar also , and the tables with the show bread on them ;
and they brought up the ark , and the Tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb , when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of Yahweh filled God 's house .
but I have built you a house of habitation , and a place for you to dwell in forever . "
he said , " Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
he stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" but will God indeed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house which I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and to his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and do , and judge your servants , bringing retribution to the wicked , to bring his way on his own head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @-@ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
so Solomon held the feast at that time seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly , from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt .
on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yahweh , and in his own house .
Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
" if I shut up the sky so that there is no rain , or if I command the locust to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth Horon the upper , and Beth Horon the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel didn 't consume , of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers of king Solomon , even two @-@ hundred fifty , who ruled over the people .
then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh , which he had built before the porch ,
they didn 't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
besides that which the traders and merchants brought : and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
for the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you are kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . ' "
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was brought about of God , that Yahweh might establish his word , which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
after them , out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and sixty concubines , and became the father of twenty @-@ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
nevertheless they shall be his servants , that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries . "
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , who were mighty men of valor .
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Yahweh , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
but Abijah grew mighty , and took to himself fourteen wives , and became the father of twenty @-@ two sons , and sixteen daughters .
for he took away the foreign altars , and the high places , and broke down the pillars , and cut down the Asherim ,
and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
ASA had an army that bore bucklers and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bore shields and drew bows , two hundred eighty thousand : all these were mighty men of valor .
there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred chariots ; and he came to Mareshah .
they swore to Yahweh with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
then Asa was angry with the seer , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . ASA oppressed some of the people at the same time .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which Asa his father had taken .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben Hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethanel , and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
the fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and silver for tribute ; the Arabians also brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats .
he had many works in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Yahweh ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
these were those who waited on the king , besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah .
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
but Jehoshaphat said , " isn 't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides , that we may inquire of him ? "
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
Yahweh said , ' Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ' one spoke saying in this way , and another saying in that way .
" now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
Micaiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Yahweh has not spoken by me . " he said , " Listen , you peoples , all of you ! "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yahweh , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
then some came who told Jehoshaphat , saying , " A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria . behold , they are in Hazazon Tamar " ( that is , En Gedi ) .
Judah gathered themselves together , to seek help from Yahweh . they came out of all the cities of Judah to seek Yahweh .
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh , worshipping Yahweh .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , everyone helped to destroy another .
when Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah ; for there they blessed Yahweh : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
he had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
their father gave them great gifts , of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fortified cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram , because he was the firstborn .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
then Jehoram passed over with his captains , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , along with the captains of the chariots .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , and led Judah astray .
the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place ; for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
forty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
all the assembly made a covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " Behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
he set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh , that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
so the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh .
thus Joash the king didn 't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . "
for the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men ; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand , because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers . so they executed judgment on Joash .
these are those who conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
a man of God came to him , saying , " O king , don 't let the army of Israel go with you ; for Yahweh is not with Israel , with all the children of Ephraim .
Amaziah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen ; for it was of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they had sought after the gods of Edom .
so Joash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jechiliah , of Jerusalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared for them , even for all the army , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and stones for slinging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , wrote .
Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he didn 't enter into Yahweh 's temple . the people still did corruptly .
moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them valiant men ; because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the captives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you . "
in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yahweh , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don 't be negligent now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn incense . "
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of Yahweh . "
then Hezekiah the king arose early , and gathered the princes of the city , and went up to the house of Yahweh .
Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar . when the burnt offering began , the song of Yahweh began also , and the trumpets , together with the instruments of David king of Israel .
all the assembly worshiped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls , one hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
Hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , because of that which God had prepared for the people : for the thing was done suddenly .
Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , to keep the Passover to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
so the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even to Zebulun : but they ridiculed them , and mocked them .
also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart , to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh .
Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the porter at the east gate , was over the freewill offerings of God , to distribute the offerings of Yahweh , and the most holy things .
and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers ' houses , and the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their offices by their divisions ;
in every work that he began in the service of God 's house , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
hasn 't the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , ' You shall worship before one altar , and on it you shall burn incense ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
Hezekiah the king , and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , prayed because of this , and cried to heaven .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem , and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah ; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick even to death : and he prayed to Yahweh ; and he spoke to him , and gave him a sign .
but Hezekiah didn 't render again according to the benefit done to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath on him , and on Judah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh in chains , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
he built up the altar of Yahweh , and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving , and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
he broke down the altars , and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder , and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel , and returned to Jerusalem .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service : and of the Levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh , Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses .
Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
Shaphan carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem , and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God ; he didn 't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
even those , Cyrus king of Persia brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them to Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy @-@ four .
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred singing men and singing women .
their camels , four hundred thirty @-@ five ; their donkeys , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty @-@ one thousand darics of gold , and five thousand Minas of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new moons , of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated , and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh ; but the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was not yet laid .
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
be it known to the king , that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem ; they are building the rebellious and the bad city , and have finished the walls , and repaired the foundations .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dishonor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were beyond the River , sent to Darius the king ;
then we asked those elders , and said to them thus , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon , Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God .
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
with three courses of great stones , and a course of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king 's house .
now therefore , Tattenai , governor beyond the River , Shetharbozenai , and your companions the Apharsachites , who are beyond the River , you must stay far from there .
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
now after these things , in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia , Ezra the son of Seraiah , the son of Azariah , the son of Hilkiah ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Adonikam , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were mentioned by name .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river Ahava , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of him a straight way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
I said to them , " You are holy to Yahweh , and the vessels are holy ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh , the God of your fathers .
so the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
arise ; for the matter belongs to you , and we are with you . be courageous , and do it . "
then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they swore .
they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
Ezra the priest stood up , and said to them , " You have trespassed , and have married foreign women , to increase the guilt of Israel .
now therefore make confession to Yahweh , the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure ; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign women . "
of Israel : of the sons of Parosh : Ramiah , and Izziah , and Malchijah , and Mijamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
they said to me , " The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
we have dealt very corruptly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you trespass , I will scatter you abroad among the peoples ;
" now these are your servants and your people , whom you have redeemed by your great power , and by your strong hand .
the king said to me , " Why is your face sad , since you are not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . " then I was very much afraid .
moreover I said to the king , " If it pleases the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
the sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
next to them , the Tekoites made repairs ; but their nobles didn 't put their necks to the work of their lord .
Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the old gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , and its bolts , and its bars .
next to them , Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs across from his house . next to him , Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs .
Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the valley gate . they built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars , and one thousand cubits of the wall to the dung gate .
Malchijah the son of Rechab , the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the dung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
next to him , Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , repaired another portion , across from the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion , from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
after them , Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs across from their house . after them , Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made repairs beside his own house .
after him , Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another portion , from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall , and to the corner .
( now the Nethinim lived in Ophel , to the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that stands out . )
after them , Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house . after him , Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah , the keeper of the east gate made repairs .
" hear , our God ; for we are despised ; and turn back their reproach on their own head , give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity ;
Don 't cover their iniquity , and don 't let their sin be blotted out from before you ; for they have insulted the builders . "
our adversaries said , " They shall not know , neither see , until we come into their midst , and kill them , and cause the work to cease . "
it happened that when the Jews who lived by them came , they said to us ten times from all places , " Wherever you turn , they will attack us . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
I said to the nobles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
for there were that said , " We , our sons and our daughters , are many . let us get grain , that we may eat and live . "
then I consulted with myself , and contended with the nobles and the rulers , and said to them , " You exact usury , everyone of his brother . " I held a great assembly against them .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can 't come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
I said , " Should such a man as I flee ? who is there that , being such as I , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in . "
" remember , my God , Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works , and also the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear . "
so the wall was finished in the twenty @-@ fifth day of Elul , in fifty @-@ two days .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these searched for their geneological records , but couldn 't find them . therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred forty @-@ five singing men and singing women .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand two hundred Minas of silver .
Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and Ezra blessed Yahweh , the great God . all the people answered , " Amen , Amen , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground .
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , " Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be grieved . "
now in the twenty @-@ fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackcloth , and earth on them .
then Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs , and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God .
you are Yahweh , the God who chose Abram , and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gave him the name of Abraham ,
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
yes , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful blasphemies ;
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples , which you allotted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
however you are just in all that has come on us ; for you have dealt truly , but we have done wickedly ;
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
yet for all this , we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , our Levites , and our priests , seal it . "
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
also we made ordinances for ourselves , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ;
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of God 's house ,
and their brothers , mighty men of valor , one hundred twenty @-@ eight ; and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of Haggedolim .
of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
moreover the porters , Akkub , Talmon , and their brothers , who kept watch at the gates , were one hundred seventy @-@ two .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest the scribe .
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
because they didn 't meet the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , to curse them : however our God turned the curse into a blessing .
now before this , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tobiah ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frankincense .
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
then I contended with the rulers , and said , " Why is God 's house forsaken ? " I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said to them , " What evil thing is this that you do , and profane the Sabbath day ?
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the first fruits . remember me , my God , for good .
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus .
" what shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law , because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs ? "
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
there was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
the king loved Esther more than all the women , and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants , even Esther 's feast ; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces , and gave gifts according to the king 's bounty .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
this thing became known to Mordecai , who informed Esther the queen ; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai 's name .
the king said to Haman , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that they should be ready against that day .
the couriers went forth in haste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa . the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
he came even before the king 's gate , for no one is allowed inside the king 's gate clothed with sackcloth .
then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther , " Don 't think to yourself that you will escape in the king 's house any more than all the Jews .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Esther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
Esther said , " If it seems good to the king , let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him . "
then the king said , " Bring Haman quickly , so that it may be done as Esther has said . " so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Haman also said , " Yes , Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
the king said , " What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this ? " then the king 's servants who attended him said , " Nothing has been done for him . "
let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear , and the horse that the king rides on , and on the head of which a crown royal is set .
Esther said , " An adversary and an enemy , even this wicked Haman ! " then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
on that day , King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman , the Jews ' enemy , to Esther the queen . Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was to her .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , " See , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged on the gallows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by courier on horseback , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds .
on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
on that day , the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king .
this was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job . that man was blameless and upright , and one who feared God , and turned away from evil .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
now it happened on the day when God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan also came among them .
but put forth your hand now , and touch all that he has , and he will renounce you to your face . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
then Job arose , and tore his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshiped .
he said , " Naked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Yahweh gave , and Yahweh has taken away . blessed be the name of Yahweh . "
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh .
but put forth your hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will renounce you to your face . "
" let the day perish in which I was born , the night which said , ' There is a boy conceived . '
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terrify it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
how much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth !
but he saves from the sword of their mouth , even the needy from the hand of the mighty .
" behold , happy is the man whom God corrects . therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn 't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
in the dry season , they vanish . when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I toss and turn until the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust . my skin closes up , and breaks out afresh .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the anguish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
I loathe my life . I don 't want to live forever . leave me alone , for my days are but a breath .
if I have sinned , what do I do to you , you watcher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
God who is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who has hardened himself against him , and prospered ?
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
they have passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that swoops on the prey .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
you have clothed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together with bones and sinews .
if I am wicked , woe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction .
" can you fathom the mystery of God ? or can you probe the limits of the Almighty ?
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
also you shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid . yes , many shall court your favor .
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
" but ask the animals , now , and they shall teach you ; the birds of the sky , and they shall tell you .
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach you . the fish of the sea shall declare to you .
he uncovers deep things out of darkness , and brings out to light the shadow of death .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also flees like a shadow , and doesn 't continue .
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
" should a wise man answer with vain knowledge , and fill himself with the east wind ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
he wanders abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
he has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . he has gnashed on me with his teeth . my adversary sharpens his eyes on me .
they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
they change the night into day , saying ' The light is near ' in the presence of darkness .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he wanders into its mesh .
he has broken me down on every side , and I am gone . my hope he has plucked up like a tree .
those who dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger . I am an alien in their sight .
" have pity on me , have pity on me , you my friends ; for the hand of God has touched me .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
" because he knew no quietness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he delights .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
" how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sorrows in his anger ?
how often is it that they are as stubble before the wind , as chaff that the storm carries away ?
for you say , ' Where is the house of the prince ? where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? '
" can a man be profitable to God ? surely he who is wise is profitable to himself .
" isn 't God in the heights of heaven ? see the height of the stars , how high they are !
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he doesn 't see . he walks on the vault of the sky . '
yet he filled their houses with good things , but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
for then you will delight yourself in the Almighty , and shall lift up your face to God .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your vows .
when they cast down , you shall say , ' be lifted up . ' he will save the humble person .
he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
but he knows the way that I take . when he has tried me , I shall come forth like gold .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don 't know its ways , nor stay in its paths .
the eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight , saying , ' No eye shall see me . ' he disguises his face .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don 't know the light .
" they are foam on the surface of the waters . their portion is cursed in the earth . they don 't turn into the way of the vineyards .
how then can man be just with God ? or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ?
behold , these are but the outskirts of his ways . how small a whisper do we hear of him ! but the thunder of his power who can understand ? "
I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
" let my enemy be as the wicked . let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous .
" this is the portion of a wicked man with God , the heritage of oppressors , which they receive from the Almighty .
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal . yes , the price of wisdom is above rubies .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
to man he said , ' Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom . to depart from evil is understanding . ' "
I was a father to the needy . the cause of him who I didn 't know , I searched out .
I chose out their way , and sat as chief . I lived as a king in the army , as one who comforts the mourners .
they are gaunt from lack and famine . they gnaw the dry ground , in the gloom of waste and desolation .
" now my soul is poured out within me . days of affliction have taken hold on me .
" I made a covenant with my eyes , how then should I look lustfully at a young woman ?
then let me sow , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
" if my heart has been enticed to a woman , and I have laid wait at my neighbor 's door ,
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
if I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or that the needy had no covering ;
" if I have made gold my hope , and have said to the fine gold , ' You are my confidence ; '
if the men of my tent have not said , ' Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? '
Oh that I had one to hear me ! ( behold , here is my signature , let the Almighty answer me ) ; let the accuser write my indictment !
let briars grow instead of wheat , and stinkweed instead of barley . " the words of Job are ended .
for I don 't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
" behold , I will answer you . in this you are not just , for God is greater than man .
" if there is beside him an angel , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to show to man what is right for him ;
he sings before men , and says , ' I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it didn 't profit me .
" behold , God works all these things , twice , yes three times , with a man ,
who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ?
shall even one who hates justice govern ? will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ? --
in a moment they die , even at midnight . the people are shaken and pass away . the mighty are taken away without a hand .
therefore he takes knowledge of their works . he overturns them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky ? '
" bear with me a little , and I will show you ; for I still have something to say on God 's behalf .
he doesn 't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
but if they don 't listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .
Don 't let riches entice you to wrath , neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside .
who has prescribed his way for him ? or who can say , ' You have committed unrighteousness ? '
you whose clothing is warm , when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ?
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
have the gates of death been revealed to you ? or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
can you lead forth the constellations in their season ? or can you guide the Bear with her cubs ?
can you send forth lightnings , that they may go ? do they report to you , ' Here we are ? '
who provides for the raven his prey , when his young ones cry to God , and wander for lack of food ?
can you number the months that they fulfill ? or do you know the time when they give birth ?
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don 't return again .
can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness ? or will he till the valleys after you ?
she deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
he eats up the ground with fierceness and rage , neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet .
as often as the trumpet sounds he snorts , ' Aha ! ' he smells the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
or do you have an arm like God ? can you thunder with a voice like him ?
behold , the hope of him is in vain . won 't one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
blessed is the man who doesn 't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ;
ask of me , and I will give the nations for your inheritance , the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession .
give sincere homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish in the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . blessed are all those who take refuge in him .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
but as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness , and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High .
for you have maintained my just cause . you sit on the throne judging righteously .
Yahweh has made himself known . he has executed judgment . the wicked is snared by the work of his own hands . meditation . Selah .
the wicked , in the pride of his face , has no room in his thoughts for God .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; How long , Yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
from the wicked who oppress me , my deadly enemies , who surround me .
I call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised ; and I am saved from my enemies .
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
more to be desired are they than gold , yes , than much fine gold ; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb .
keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . let them not have dominion over me . then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression .
save , Yahweh ! let the King answer us when we call !
I can count all of my bones . they look and stare at me .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing .
show me your ways , Yahweh . teach me your paths .
& lt ; & lt ; By David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
when evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh , even my adversaries and my foes , they stumbled and fell .
one thing I have asked of Yahweh , that I will seek after , that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life , to see Yahweh 's beauty , and to inquire in his temple .
give them according to their work , and according to the wickedness of their doings . give them according to the operation of their hands . bring back on them what they deserve .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
Oh how great is your goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
for this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him .
let them be as chaff before the wind , Yahweh 's angel driving them on .
let their way be dark and slippery , Yahweh 's angel pursuing them .
let destruction come on him unawares . let his net that he has hidden catch himself . let him fall into that destruction .
all my bones shall say , " Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? "
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
for yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . yes , though you look for his place , he isn 't there .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . those who are cursed by him shall be cut off .
depart from evil , and do good . live securely forever .
Yahweh will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
as for transgressors , they shall be destroyed together . the future of the wicked shall be cut off .

" be still , and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations . I will be exalted in the earth . "
the princes of the peoples are gathered together , the people of the God of Abraham . for the shields of the earth belong to God . he is greatly exalted !
their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever , and their dwelling places to all generations . they name their lands after themselves .
wash me thoroughly from my iniquity . cleanse me from my sin .
against you , and you only , have I sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah .
every one of them has gone back . they have become filthy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
there they were in great fear , where no fear was , for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you . you have put them to shame , because God has rejected them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! when God brings back his people from captivity , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
but it was you , a man like me , my companion , and my familiar friend .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his covenant .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in anger cast down the peoples , God .
you number my wanderings . you put my tears into your bottle . aren 't they in your book ?
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .

blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
they also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders . you call the morning 's dawn and the evening with songs of joy .
the pastures are covered with flocks . the valleys also are clothed with grain . they shout for joy ! they also sing .
if I cherished sin in my heart , the Lord wouldn 't have listened .
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy , for you will judge the peoples with equity , and govern the nations on earth . Selah .
you , God , sent a plentiful rain . you confirmed your inheritance , when it was weary .
your congregation lived therein . you , God , prepared your goodness for the poor .

deliver me out of the mire , and don 't let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
& lt ; & lt ; By Solomon . & gt ; & gt ; God , give the king your justice ; your righteousness to the royal son .

therefore pride is like a chain around their neck . violence covers them like a garment .
now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers .
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked , but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a Psalm by Asaph . a song . & gt ; & gt ; In Judah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .

& lt ; & lt ; A contemplation by Asaph . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
when he killed them , then they inquired after him . they returned and sought God earnestly .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
from following the ewes that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .

but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
they don 't know , neither do they understand . they walk back and forth in darkness . all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
show us your loving kindness , Yahweh . grant us your salvation .
& lt ; & lt ; A Prayer by David . & gt ; & gt ; Hear , Yahweh , and answer me , for I am poor and needy .
teach me your way , Yahweh . I will walk in your truth . make my heart undivided to fear your name .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob .
his seed will endure forever , his throne like the sun before me .
he who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty .
your statutes stand firm . Holiness adorns your house , Yahweh , forevermore .
unless Yahweh had been my help , my soul would have soon lived in silence .
make a joyful noise to Yahweh , all the earth ! burst out and sing for joy , yes , sing praises !
& lt ; & lt ; A Prayer of the afflicted , when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my prayer , Yahweh ! let my cry come to you .

& lt ; & lt ; A Song . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; My heart is steadfast , God . I will sing and I will make music with my soul .
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
let his days be few . let another take his office .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children .
he clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment . it came into his inward parts like water , like oil into his bones .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth .
Yahweh has sworn , and will not change his mind : " you are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . "
the wicked will see it , and be grieved . he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away . the desire of the wicked will perish .
what was it , you sea , that you fled ? you Jordan , that you turned back ?
Yahweh remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
& lt ; & lt ; A Song of ascents . & gt ; & gt ; In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . he answered me .
where the tribes go up , even Yah 's tribes , according to an ordinance for Israel , to give thanks to the name of Yahweh .
peace be within your walls , and prosperity within your palaces .
surely I have stilled and quieted my soul , like a weaned child with his mother , like a weaned child is my soul within me .
& lt ; & lt ; A Song of ascents . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , remember David and all his affliction ,
if your children will keep my covenant , my testimony that I will teach them , their children also will sit on your throne forevermore . "
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
& lt ; & lt ; A Song of ascents . & gt ; & gt ; Look ! praise Yahweh , all you servants of Yahweh , who stand by night in Yahweh 's house !
for there , those who led us captive asked us for songs . those who tormented us demanded songs of joy : " sing us one of the songs of Zion ! "
the proud have hidden a snare for me , they have spread the cords of a net by the path . they have set traps for me . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my prayer , Yahweh . listen to my petitions . in your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
I will sing a new song to you , God . on a ten @-@ stringed lyre , I will sing praises to you .
he has also established them forever and ever . he has made a decree which will not pass away .
he has lifted up the horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . praise Yah !
may the high praises of God be in their mouths , and a two @-@ edged sword in their hand ;
if they say , " Come with us , Let 's lay in wait for blood ; let 's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause ;
turn at my reproof . behold , I will pour out my spirit on you . I will make known my words to you .
because I have called , and you have refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no one has paid attention ;
but whoever listens to me will dwell securely , and will be at ease , without fear of harm . "

when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don 't say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
but the path of the righteous is like the dawning light , that shines more and more until the perfect day .
but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood , and as sharp as a two @-@ edged sword .
my son , if you have become collateral for your neighbor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger ;
to keep you from the immoral woman , from the flattery of the wayward wife 's tongue .
but if he is found , he shall restore seven times . he shall give all the wealth of his house .
therefore I came out to meet you , to diligently seek your face , and I have found you .
now therefore , sons , listen to me . pay attention to the words of my mouth .
on the top of high places by the way , where the paths meet , she stands .
beside the gates , at the entry of the city , at the entry doors , she cries aloud :
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness . there is nothing crooked or perverse in them .
for wisdom is better than rubies . all the things that may be desired can 't be compared to it .
the fear of Yahweh is to hate evil . I hate pride , arrogance , the evil way , and the perverse mouth .
while as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the beginning of the dust of the world .
" come , eat some of my bread , Drink some of the wine which I have mixed !

he who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker , but he who is kind to the needy honors him .
the way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh , but he loves him who follows after righteousness .
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes ; but Yahweh weighs the motives .
by mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for . by the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil .
when a man 's ways please Yahweh , he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him .
understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it , but the punishment of fools is their folly .
one who winks his eyes to plot perversities , one who compresses his lips , is bent on evil .
a bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it ; wherever he turns , he prospers .

Don 't forsake your friend and your father 's friend . Don 't go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
those who forsake the law praise the wicked ; but those who keep the law contend with them .

is there a thing of which it may be said , " Behold , this is new ? " it has been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
that which is crooked can 't be made straight ; and that which is lacking can 't be counted .
I made myself gardens and parks , and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit .
I made myself pools of water , to water from it the forest where trees were reared .
for what has a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , in which he labors under the sun ?
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
that which is has been long ago , and that which is to be has been long ago : and God seeks again that which is passed away .

which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm , and his wise heart will know the time and procedure .
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .

the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .

their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
in that day , men shall cast away their idols of silver , and their idols of gold , which have been made for themselves to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
for , behold , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support , the whole supply of bread , and the whole supply of water ;
the mighty man , the man of war , the judge , the prophet , the diviner , the elder ,
the captain of fifty , the honorable man , the counselor , the skilled craftsman , and the clever enchanter .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .

in that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets , the headbands , the crescent necklaces ,
in that day , Yahweh 's branch will be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel .
Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion , and over her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night ; for over all the glory will be a canopy .
let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard . my beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill .
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
I will lay it a wasteland . it won 't be pruned nor hoed , but it will grow briers and thorns . I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it . "
woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !

Yahweh will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify : Uriah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah . "

turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don 't speak according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
you have multiplied the nation . you have increased their joy . they rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest , as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , you have broken as in the day of Midian .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
all the people will know , including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria , who say in pride and in arrogance of heart ,
the Syrians in front , and the Philistines behind ; and they will devour Israel with open mouth . for all this , his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spares his brother .
one will devour on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm :
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
they will only bow down under the prisoners , and will fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
however he doesn 't mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard bearer faints .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him , as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb . his rod will be over the sea , and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt .

behold , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will lop the boughs with terror . the tall will be cut down , and the lofty will be brought low .
his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
the nursing child will play near a cobra 's hole , and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper 's den .
they will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain ; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh , as the waters cover the sea .
the envy also of Ephraim will depart , and those who persecute Judah will be cut off . Ephraim won 't envy Judah , and Judah won 't persecute Ephraim .
there will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria , like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
in that day you will say , " Give thanks to Yahweh ! call on his name . declare his doings among the peoples . proclaim that his name is exalted !
I have commanded my consecrated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even Yahweh , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
wail ; for the day of Yahweh is at hand ! it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
behold , the day of Yahweh comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a desolation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible .

Babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldeans ' pride , will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
but wild animals of the desert will lie there , and their houses will be full of jackals . Ostriches will dwell there , and wild goats will frolic there .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
they all will answer and ask you , " Have you also become as weak as we are ? have you become like us ? "
your pomp is brought down to Sheol , with the sound of your stringed instruments . maggots are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
those who see you will stare at you . they will ponder you , saying , " Is this the man who made the earth to tremble , who shook kingdoms ;
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of evildoers will not be named forever .
" I will rise up against them , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and cut off from Babylon name and remnant , and son and son 's son , " says Yahweh .
this is the plan that is determined for the whole earth . this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations .
for Yahweh of Armies has planned , and who can stop it ? his hand is stretched out , and who can turn it back ? "
the firstborn of the poor will eat , and the needy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remnant will be killed .
howl , gate ! cry , city ! you are melted away , Philistia , all of you ; for smoke comes out of the north , and there is no straggler in his ranks .
for the waters of Dimon are full of blood ; for I will bring yet more on Dimon , a lion on those of Moab who escape , and on the remnant of the land .
give counsel ! execute justice ! make your shade like the night in the midst of the noonday ! hide the outcasts ! Don 't betray the fugitive !
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his boastings are nothing .
it will happen that when Moab presents himself , when he wearies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
the burden of Damascus : " behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it will be a ruinous heap .
the fortress shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Yahweh of Armies .
it will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat , and his arm reaps the grain . yes , it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the uproar of many peoples , who roar like the roaring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trumpet is blown , listen !
for Yahweh said to me , " I will be still , and I will see in my dwelling place , like clear heat in sunshine , like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest . "
I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians , and they will fight everyone against his brother , and everyone against his neighbor ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the charmers , those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards .
I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord . a fierce king will rule over them , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies , which he shakes over them .
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea . as whirlwinds in the South sweep through , it comes from the wilderness , from an awesome land .
a grievous vision is declared to me . the treacherous man deals treacherously , and the destroyer destroys . go up , ELAM ; attack ! I have stopped all of Media 's sighing .
behold , here comes a troop of men , horsemen in pairs . " he answered , " Fallen , fallen is Babylon ; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground .
you are my threshing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
the burden of Dumah . one calls to me out of Seir , " Watchman , what of the night ? watchman , what of the night ? "
the burden on Arabia . in the forest in Arabia you will lodge , you caravans of Dedanites .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
the burden of the valley of vision . what ails you now , that you have all gone up to the housetops ?
all your rulers fled away together . they were bound by the archers . all who were found by you were bound together . they fled far away .
therefore I said , " Look away from me . I will weep bitterly . Don 't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
it happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots , and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
in that day , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , called to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to dressing in sackcloth :
Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears , " Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
'What are you doing here ? who has you here , that you have dug out a tomb here ? ' cutting himself out a tomb on high , chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock ! "
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the pitchers .
the burden of Tyre . howl , you ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them .
on great waters , the seed of the Shihor , the harvest of the Nile , was her revenue . she was the market of nations .
be ashamed , Sidon ; for the sea has spoken , the stronghold of the sea , saying , " I have not travailed , nor brought forth , neither have I nourished young men , nor brought up virgins . "
who has planned this against Tyre , the giver of crowns , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth ?
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the kingdoms . Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan 's strongholds .
take a harp ; go about the city , you prostitute that has been forgotten . make sweet melody . sing many songs , that you may be remembered .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
the earth also is polluted under its inhabitants , because they have transgressed the laws , violated the statutes , and broken the everlasting covenant .
therefore the curse has devoured the earth , and those who dwell therein are found guilty . therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
these shall lift up their voice . they will shout for the majesty of Yahweh . they cry aloud from the sea .
the earth will stagger like a drunken man , and will sway back and forth like a hammock . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
then the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed ; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion , and in Jerusalem ; and before his elders will be glory .
for you have made a city into a heap , a fortified city into a ruin , a palace of strangers to be no city . it will never be built .
in this mountain , Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
he will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples , and the veil that is spread over all nations .
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swims spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands .
in that day , this song will be sung in the land of Judah : " we have a strong city . God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully , and will not see Yahweh 's majesty .
Yahweh , your hand is lifted up , yet they don 't see ; but they will see your zeal for the people , and be disappointed . yes , fire will consume your adversaries .
the dead shall not live . the deceased shall not rise . therefore have you visited and destroyed them , and caused all memory of them to perish .
your dead shall live . my dead bodies shall arise . awake and sing , you who dwell in the dust ; for your dew is like the dew of herbs , and the earth will cast forth the dead .
in that day , Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan , the fleeing serpent , and leviathan the twisted serpent ; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness . the calf will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
it will happen in that day , that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
your covenant with death shall be annulled , and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand . when the overflowing scourge passes through , then you will be trampled down by it .
for Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim . he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon ; that he may do his work , his unusual work , and bring to pass his act , his extraordinary act .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
but the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all who fight against her and her stronghold , and who distress her , will be like a dream , a vision of the night .
isn 't it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
for the ruthless is brought to nothing , and the scoffer ceases , and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
" woe to the rebellious children , " says Yahweh , " who take counsel , but not from me ; and who make an alliance , but not with my Spirit , that they may add sin to sin ,
who tell the seers , " Don 't see ! " and to the prophets , " Don 't prophesy to us right things . tell us pleasant things . prophesy deceits .
for the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem . you will weep no more . he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
behold , the name of Yahweh comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a devouring fire .
his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction ; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Yahweh will lay on him , will be with the sound of tambourines and harps . he will fight with them in battles , brandishing weapons .
as birds hovering , so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem . he will protect and deliver it . he will pass over and preserve it . "
his rock will pass away by reason of terror , and his princes will be afraid of the banner , " says Yahweh , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
rise up , you women who are at ease ! hear my voice ! you careless daughters , give ear to my speech !
for the palace will be forsaken . the populous city will be deserted . the hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever , a delight for wild donkeys , a pasture of flocks ;
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high , and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field , and the fruitful field is considered a forest .
blessed are you who sow beside all waters , who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey .
there will be stability in your times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge . the fear of Yahweh is your treasure .
hear , you who are far off , what I have done ; and , you who are near , acknowledge my might . "
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
your heart will meditate on the terror . where is he who counted ? where is he who weighed ? where is he who counted the towers ?
but there Yahweh will be with us in majesty , a place of broad rivers and streams , in which no galley with oars will go , neither will any gallant ship pass by there .
come near , you nations , to hear ! listen , you peoples . let the earth and all it contains hear ; the world , and everything that comes from it .
their slain will also be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
for my sword has drunk its fill in the sky . behold , it will come down on Edom , and on the people of my curse , for judgment .
thorns will come up in its palaces , nettles and thistles in its fortresses ; and it will be a habitation of jackals , a court for ostriches .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , hatch , and gather under her shade . yes , the kites will be gathered there , every one with her mate .
he has cast the lot for them , and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line . they shall possess it forever . from generation to generation they will dwell in it .
it will blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Carmel and Sharon . they will see Yahweh 's glory , the excellence of our God .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
no lion will be there , nor will any ravenous animal go up on it . they will not be found there ; but the redeemed will walk there .
now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah , and captured them .
the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army . he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller 's field highway .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder came out to him .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Now tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it ? Yahweh said to me , " Go up against this land , and destroy it . " ' "
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth , and went into Yahweh 's house .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
" thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ' Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him . the virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt . "
by the way that he came , by the same he shall return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
" go , and tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
I said , " I won 't see Yah , Yah in the land of the living . I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul .
Lord , men live by these things ; and my spirit finds life in all of them : you restore me , and cause me to live .
behold , for peace I had great anguish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
for Sheol can 't praise you . death can 't celebrate you . those who go down into the pit can 't hope for your truth .
Hezekiah also had said , " What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Yahweh ? "
'Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Yahweh .
'They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " Yahweh 's word which you have spoken is good . " he said moreover , " For there will be peace and truth in my days . "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned , that she has received of Yahweh 's hand double for all her sins . "
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low . the uneven shall be made level , and the rough places a plain .
the glory of Yahweh shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it . "
behold , the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him .
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
all the nations are like nothing before him . they are regarded by him as less than nothing , and vanity .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard , yet ? haven 't you been told from the beginning ? haven 't you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
they are planted scarcely . they are sown scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wither , and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard ? the everlasting God , Yahweh , The Creator of the ends of the earth , doesn 't faint . he isn 't weary . his understanding is unsearchable .
but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eagles . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
" keep silent before me , islands , and let the peoples renew their strength . let them come near , then let them speak . let 's meet together for judgment .
the islands have seen , and fear . the ends of the earth tremble . they approach , and come .
behold , all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
behold , I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth . you will thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and will make the hills like chaff .
you will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whirlwind will scatter them . you will rejoice in Yahweh . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
the poor and needy seek water , and there is none . their tongue fails for thirst . I , Yahweh , will answer them . I , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
that they may see , know , consider , and understand together , that the hand of Yahweh has done this , and the Holy One of Israel has created it .
produce your cause , " says Yahweh . " bring forth your strong reasons , " says the King of Jacob .
behold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who chooses you is an abomination .
he won 't break a bruised reed . he won 't quench a dimly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , until he has set justice in the earth , and the islands will wait for his law . "
" I , Yahweh , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
" I am Yahweh . that is my name . I will not give my glory to another , nor my praise to engraved images .
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that Kedar inhabits . let the inhabitants of Sela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
who is blind , but my servant ? or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send ? who is as blind as he who is at peace , and as blind as Yahweh 's servant ?
who gave Jacob as plunder , and Israel to the robbers ? didn 't Yahweh , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , and they disobeyed his law .
Don 't be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your seed from the east , and gather you from the west .
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " and I am God .
thus says Yahweh , who makes a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ;
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wearied you with frankincense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wearied me with your iniquities .
this is what Yahweh who made you , and formed you from the womb , who will help you says : " Don 't be afraid , Jacob my servant ; and you , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water on him who is thirsty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
who is like me ? who will call , and will declare it , and set it in order for me , since I established the ancient people ? let them declare the things that are coming , and that will happen .
they don 't know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can 't see ; and their hearts , that they can 't understand .
remember these things , Jacob and Israel ; for you are my servant . I have formed you . you are my servant . Israel , you will not be forgotten by me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , your transgressions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have redeemed you .
who frustrates the signs of the liars , and makes diviners mad ; who turns wise men backward , and makes their knowledge foolish ;
who says to the deep , ' Be dry , ' and ' I will dry up your rivers ; '
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yahweh , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
I am Yahweh , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
I form the light , and create darkness . I make peace , and create calamity . I am Yahweh , who does all these things .
woe to him who says to a father , ' What have you become the father of ? ' or to a mother , ' To what have you given birth ? ' "
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
they will be disappointed , yes , confounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
" look to me , and be saved , all the ends of the earth ; for I am God , and there is no other .
and even to old age I am he , and even to gray hairs will I carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; yes , I will carry , and will deliver .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ;
I bring near my righteousness , it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not wait ; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory .
" come down , and sit in the dust , virgin daughter of Babylon ; sit on the ground without a throne , daughter of the Chaldeans : for you shall no more be called tender and delicate .
take the millstones , and grind meal ; remove your veil , strip off the train , uncover the leg , pass through the rivers .
your nakedness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
" sit in silence , and go into darkness , daughter of the Chaldeans ; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
you are wearied in the multitude of your counsels : let now the astrologers , the Stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save you from the things that shall come on you .
behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : it shall not be a coal to warm at , nor a fire to sit before .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves on the God of Israel ; Yahweh of Armies is his name ) :
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be profaned ? I will not give my glory to another .
" listen to me , O Jacob , and Israel my called : I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
go forth from Babylon , flee from the Chaldeans ; with a voice of singing declare , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth : say , Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob .
they didn 't thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
" can a woman forget her nursing child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? yes , these may forget , yet I will not forget you !
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yahweh , who obeys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yahweh , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Yahweh : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
" listen to me , you who know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; don 't fear the reproach of men , neither be dismayed at their insults .
awake , awake , put on strength , arm of Yahweh ; awake , as in the days of old , the generations of ancient times . isn 't it you who cut Rahab in pieces , who pierced the monster ?
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
these two things have happened to you . who will bemoan you ? desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall I comfort you ?
shake yourself from the dust ! arise , sit up , Jerusalem ! release yourself from the bonds of your neck , captive daughter of Zion !
depart , depart , go out from there , touch no unclean thing ! go out of the midst of her ! cleanse yourselves , you who bear the vessels of Yahweh .
for you shall not go out in haste , neither shall you go by flight : for Yahweh will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
but he was pierced for our transgressions . he was crushed for our iniquities . the punishment that brought our peace was on him ; and by his wounds we are healed .
all we like sheep have gone astray . everyone has turned to his own way ; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all .
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
after the suffering of his soul , he will see the light and be satisfied . my righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself ; and he will bear their iniquities .
for your Maker is your husband ; Yahweh of Armies is his name : and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer ; the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
" for a small moment have I forsaken you ; but with great mercies will I gather you .
in overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment ; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you , " says Yahweh your Redeemer .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my covenant of peace be removed , " says Yahweh who has mercy on you .
" you afflicted , tossed with storms , and not comforted , behold , I will set your stones in beautiful colors , and lay your foundations with sapphires .
" behold , I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals , and brings forth a weapon for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Yahweh , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
" for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
for you shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing ; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands .
thus says Yahweh , " Keep justice , and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yahweh , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and holds fast my covenant ;
his watchmen are blind , they are all without knowledge ; they are all mute dogs , they can 't bark ; dreaming , lying down , loving to slumber .
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shepherds who can 't understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
" come , " say they , " I will get wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and tomorrow shall be as this day , great beyond measure . "
he enters into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one who walks in his uprightness .
on a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed ; there also you went up to offer sacrifice .
you were wearied with the length of your way ; yet you didn 't say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you weren 't faint .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart .
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obscurity be as the noonday ;
they hatch Adders ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he who eats of their eggs dies ; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
for our transgressions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
for , behold , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the peoples ; but Yahweh will arise on you , and his glory shall be seen on you .
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your daughters shall be carried in the arms .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
the multitude of camels shall cover you , the dromedaries of Midian and ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come ; they shall bring gold and frankincense , and shall proclaim the praises of Yahweh .
your gates also shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations , and their kings led captive .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .

they shall call them The holy people , The redeemed of Yahweh : and you shall be called sought out , A city not forsaken .
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses ? who divided the waters before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
you meet him who rejoices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sinned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?

I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying .
a voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies .
who has heard such a thing ? who has seen such things ? shall a land be born in one day ? shall a nation be brought forth at once ? for as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children .
shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? " says Yahweh : " shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb ? " says your God .
" rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for her , all you who love her : rejoice for joy with her , all you who mourn over her ;
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for , behold , Yahweh will come with fire , and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind ; to render his anger with fierceness , and his rebuke with flames of fire .

" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
therefore the showers have been withheld , and there has been no latter rain ; yet you have a prostitute 's forehead , you refused to be ashamed .

" return , backsliding children , " says Yahweh ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
" if you will return , Israel , " says Yahweh , " if you will return to me , and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight ; then you shall not be removed ;

for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , " says Yahweh .
" but even in those days , " says Yahweh , " I will not make a full end with you .

they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit iniquity .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , Behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how should I deal with the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceit : one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .

then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah : Yahweh has not sent you ; but you make this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus says Yahweh , Behold , I will send you away from off the surface of the earth : this year you shall die , because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh .
( after that Jeconiah the king , the queen mother , the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the smiths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
take wives , and father sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there , and don 't be diminished .
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray to Yahweh for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
thus speaks Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book .
for thus says Yahweh : we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incurable : for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
for I will restore health to you , and I will heal you of your wounds , says Yahweh ; because they have called you an outcast , saying , It is Zion , whom no man seeks after .
the fierce anger of Yahweh will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
at that time , says Yahweh , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry , Arise , and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : a voice is heard in Ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refuses to be comforted for her children , because they are no more .
thus says Yahweh : refrain your voice from weeping , and your eyes from tears ; for your work shall be rewarded , says Yahweh ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus , You have chastised me , and I was chastised , as an untrained calf : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yahweh my God .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land .
Ah Lord Yahweh ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Yahweh of Armies is his name ;
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hearts , that they may not depart from me .
call to me , and I will answer you , and will show you great things , and difficult , which you don 't know .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them ; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
thus says Yahweh : if you can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , so that there shall not be day and night in their season ;
when the king of Babylon 's army was fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and against Azekah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities .
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
you had now turned , and had done that which is right in my eyes , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant , who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me , when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts ;
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh ,
then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
they said to him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears . so Baruch read it in their ears .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
the king commanded Jerahmeel the king 's son , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet ; but Yahweh hid them .
Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king , instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Yahweh , which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Pray now to Yahweh our God for us .
Pharaoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
it happened that , when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house , and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
now please hear , my lord the king : please let my supplication be presented before you , that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
thus says Yahweh , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from here thirty men with you , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he dies .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh : and the king said to Jeremiah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
and they departed , and lived in Geruth Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
because of the Chaldeans ; for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captive to Babylon .
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Memphis , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , to serve other gods , that they didn 't know , neither they , nor you , nor your fathers .
therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as it is this day .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will set my face against you for evil , even to cut off all Judah .
when we burned incense to the queen of the sky , and poured out drink offerings to her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings to her , without our husbands ?
moreover Jeremiah said to all the people , and to all the women , Hear the word of Yahweh , all Judah who are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
Don 't let the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Put , who handle the shield ; and the Ludim , who handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gilead , and take balm , virgin daughter of Egypt : in vain do you use many medicines ; there is no healing for you .
the word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
you daughter who dwells in Egypt , furnish yourself to go into captivity ; for Memphis shall become a desolation , and shall be burnt up , without inhabitant .
they shall cut down her forest , says Yahweh , though it can 't be searched ; because they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines , to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains : for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines , the remnant of the isle of Caphtor .
you sword of Yahweh , how long will it be before you be quiet ? put up yourself into your Scabbard ; rest , and be still .
how can you be quiet , since Yahweh has given you a command ? against Ashkelon , and against the seashore , there has he appointed it .
the destroyer shall come on every city , and no city shall escape ; the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed ; as Yahweh has spoken .
Moab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .
all you who are around him , bemoan him , and all you who know his name ; say , How is the strong staff broken , the beautiful rod !
Moab is disappointed ; for it is broken down : wail and cry ; tell it by the Arnon , that Moab is laid waste .
you inhabitants of Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock ; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss .
we have heard of the pride of Moab . he is very proud ; his loftiness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the haughtiness of his heart .
gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab ; and I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses : none shall tread with shouting ; the shouting shall be no shouting .
from the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh , even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even to Horonaim , to Eglath Shelishiyah : for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate .
on all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights , says Yahweh .
Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .

I have heard news from Yahweh , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , Gather yourselves together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
the earth trembles at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise which is heard in the Red Sea .
of Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad ; for they have heard evil news , they are melted away : there is sorrow on the sea ; it can 't be quiet .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh of Armies .
of Kedar , and of the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck . thus says Yahweh : arise , go up to Kedar , and destroy the children of the east .
their tents and their flocks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry to them , Terror on every side !
flee , wander far off , dwell in the depths , you inhabitants of Hazor , says Yahweh ; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you , and has conceived a purpose against you .
arise , go up to a nation that is at ease , that dwells without care , says Yahweh ; that have neither gates nor bars , that dwell alone .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning ELAM , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,

the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon , concerning the land of the Chaldeans , by Jeremiah the prophet .
in those days , and in that time , says Yahweh , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together ; they shall go on their way weeping , and shall seek Yahweh their God .
my people have been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who plunder my heritage , because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain , and neigh as strong horses ;
because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly desolate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hunted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first , the king of Assyria devoured him ; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
I will bring Israel again to his pasture , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Yahweh , and do according to all that I have commanded you .
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .

a sword is on the Chaldeans , says Yahweh , and on the inhabitants of Babylon , and on her princes , and on her wise men .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of engraved images , and they are mad over idols .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax feeble : anguish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
at the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus says Yahweh : behold , I will raise up against Babylon , and against those who dwell in Lebkamai , a destroying wind .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall winnow her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
for Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah , of his God , of Yahweh of Armies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
set up a standard against the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set the watchmen , prepare the ambushes ; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself , saying , Surely I will fill you with men , as with the canker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .

how is Sheshach taken ! and the praise of the whole earth seized ! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
my people , go away from the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
then the heavens and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for joy over Babylon ; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north , says Yahweh .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach ; confusion has covered our faces : for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh 's house .
for Yahweh lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
for the destroyer has come on her , even on Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , their bows are broken in pieces ; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses , he will surely requite .
the word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . now Seraiah was chief quartermaster .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
as for the pillars , the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits ; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it ; and its thickness was four fingers . it was hollow .
the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ; she dwells among the nations , she finds no rest : all her persecutors overtook her within the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are desolate , her priests do sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me desolate and faint all the day .
Zion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing .
Yahweh is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : please hear all you peoples , and see my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he has destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not ; Yes , her prophets find no vision from Yahweh .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your iniquity , to bring back your captivity , but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
even the jackals draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
their appearance is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin clings to their bones ; it is withered , it has become like a stick .
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yahweh has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can 't touch their garments .
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky : they chased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished , daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry you away into captivity : he will visit your iniquity , daughter of Edom ; he will uncover your sins .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of Yahweh was there on him .
each one went straight forward : where the spirit was to go , they went ; they didn 't turn when they went .
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around .
when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
under the expanse were their wings straight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
you shall speak my words to them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear ; for they are most rebellious .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
as an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead : Don 't be afraid of them , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
son of man , I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their iniquity .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
you shall eat it as barley cakes , and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this is Jerusalem ; I have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are around her .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you , in the sight of all that pass by .
and I will send on you famine and evil animals , and they shall bereave you ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you ; and I will bring the sword on you : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
the time has come , the day draws near : Don 't let the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is on all its multitude .
they have blown the trumpet , and have made all ready ; but none goes to the battle ; for my wrath is on all its multitude .
the sword is outside , and the pestilence and the famine within : he who is in the field shall die with the sword : and he who is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them moaning , every one in his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
make the chain ; for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
then he said to me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had dug in the wall , behold , a door .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of creeping things , and abominable animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women weeping for Tammuz .
then he said to me , Have you seen this , son of man ? you shall again see yet greater abominations than these .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
he said to them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain . go forth ! they went forth , and struck in the city .
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
you have multiplied your slain in this city , and you have filled its streets with the slain .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
then the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophesies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
they have seen falsehood and lying divination , who say , Yahweh says ; but Yahweh has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
tell those who plaster it with whitewash , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and you , great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it .
son of man , these men have taken their idols into their heart , and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : return , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yahweh .
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they ravage it , and it be made desolate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
I will set my face against them ; they shall go forth from the fire , but the fire shall devour them ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I set my face against them .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite ; the Amorite was your father , and your mother was a Hittite .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chaldea ; and yet you weren 't satisfied with this .
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
before your wickedness was uncovered , as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria , and of all who are around her , the daughters of the Philistines , who do despite to you all around .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also deal with you as you have done , who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his covenant it might stand .
for he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword , and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , you shall not have [ occasion ] any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
has walked in my statutes , and has kept my ordinances , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , says the Lord Yahweh .
and who does not any of those [ duties ] , but even has eaten on the mountains , and defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
has wronged the poor and needy , has taken by robbery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the idols , has committed abomination ,
now , behold , if he fathers a son , who sees all his father 's sins , which he has done , and fears , and does not such like ;
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Yahweh ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
yet you say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , house of Israel : is my way not equal ? aren 't your ways unequal ?
again , when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , in which you have transgressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
for I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies , says the Lord Yahweh : therefore turn yourselves , and live .
and say , What was your mother ? a lioness : she couched among lions , in the midst of the young lions she nourished her cubs .
she brought up one of her cubs : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
he knew their palaces , and laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and its fullness , because of the noise of his roaring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
your mother was like a vine , in your blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
will you judge them , son of man , will you judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ;
I said to them , Cast away every man the abominations of his eyes , and don 't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Yahweh your God .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers ? and do you play the prostitute after their abominations ?
and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all , in that you say , We will be as the nations , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South ;
son of man , set your face toward Jerusalem , and drop [ your word ] toward the sanctuaries , and prophesy against the land of Israel ;
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus says Yahweh : say , A sword , a sword , it is sharpened , and also furbished ;
it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mirth ? the rod of my son , it condemns every tree .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stumblings be multiplied : Ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
while they see for you false visions , while they divine lies to you , to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded , whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you , son of man , will you judge , will you judge the bloody city ? then cause her to know all her abominations .
those who are near , and those who are far from you , shall mock you , you infamous one full of tumult .
slanderous men have been in you to shed blood ; and in you they have eaten on the mountains : in the midst of you they have committed lewdness .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' nakedness ; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity .
in you have they taken bribes to shed blood ; you have taken interest and increase , and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression , and have forgotten me , says the Lord Yahweh .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and will do it .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have all become dross , therefore , behold , I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
son of man , tell her , You are a land that is not cleansed , nor rained on in the day of indignation .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
I sought for a man among them , who should build up the wall , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it ; but I found none .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them ; and on whoever she doted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
these uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a byword among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
dressed with girdles on their waists , with flowing turbans on their heads , all of them princes to look on , after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea , the land of their birth .
the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their prostitution , and she was polluted with them , and her soul was alienated from them .
she doted on their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth , in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of your sister Samaria .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
for when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and behold , thus have they done in the midst of my house .
the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness ; and they put bracelets on their hands [ twain ] , and beautiful crowns on their heads .
righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
son of man , write the name of the day , [ even ] of this same day : the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day .
utter a parable to the rebellious house , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh , Set on the caldron , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather its pieces into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she didn 't pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mourn nor weep , neither shall your tears run down .
sigh , but not aloud , make no mourning for the dead ; bind your headdress on you , and put your shoes on your feet , and don 't cover your lips , and don 't eat men 's bread .
thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you ; according to all that he has done , you will do . when this comes , then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
that in that day he who escapes shall come to you , to cause you to hear it with your ears ?
in that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped , and you shall speak , and be no more mute : so you will be a sign to them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .

thus says the Lord Yahweh : because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has greatly offended , and revenged himself on them ;
I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel ; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath ; and they shall know my vengeance , says the Lord Yahweh .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , Behold , I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethites , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall lay my vengeance on them .
son of man , because Tyre has said against Jerusalem , Aha , she is broken : the gate of the peoples ; she is turned to me ; I shall be replenished , now that she is laid waste :

he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make forts against you , and cast up a mound against you , and raise up the Buckler against you .

for thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall make you a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
they have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir ; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you .

the men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around , and valorous men were in your towers ; they hanged their shields on your walls all around ; they have perfected your beauty .
Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded for your wares .
Javan , tubal , and Meshech , they were your traffickers ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for your merchandise .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith , and confections , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks , by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches , with the wine of Helbon , and white wool .
the traffickers of Sheba and Raamah , they were your traffickers ; they traded for your wares with the chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were your traffickers in choice wares , in wrappings of blue and embroidered work , and in chests of rich clothing , bound with cords and made of cedar , among your merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise : and you were replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .

when your wares went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .

you shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .

all those who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you : you have become a terror , and you shall nevermore have any being .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : " behold , I will bring a sword on you , and will cut off man and animal from you .
the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '

again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by robbery , walk in the statutes of life , committing no iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
therefore tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes to your idols , and shed blood : and shall you possess the land ?
you stand on your sword , you work abomination , and every one of you defiles his neighbor 's wife : and shall you possess the land ?
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .

neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity .
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they profaned my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yahweh , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations , where they went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .

thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .

I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it and performed it , says Yahweh .
son of man , set your face toward Gog , of the land of Magog , the prince of Rosh , Meshech , and tubal , and prophesy against him ,
Gomer , and all his hordes ; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north , and all his hordes ; even many peoples with you .
be prepared , yes , prepare yourself , you , and all your companies who are assembled to you , and be a guard to them .
and you shall say , I will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; I will go to those who are at rest , who dwell securely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ;
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yahweh : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
I will magnify myself , and sanctify myself , and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
I will send a fire on Magog , and on those who dwell securely in the islands ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
yes , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified , says the Lord Yahweh .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , says the Lord Yahweh .
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one reed broad ; and the other threshold , one reed broad .
every lodge was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @-@ five cubits ; door against door .
then brought he me into the outer court ; and behold , there were rooms and a pavement , made for the court all around : thirty rooms were on the pavement .
the pavement was by the side of the gates , answerable to the length of the gates , even the lower pavement .
the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured its length and its breadth .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its arches were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
there was a gate to the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
he said to me , This room , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the house ;
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
then went he inward , and measured each post of the entrance , two cubits ; and the entrance , six cubits ; and the breadth of the entrance , seven cubits .
he measured its length , twenty cubits , and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said to me , This is the most holy place .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side room , four cubits , all around the house on every side .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits .
to [ the space ] above the door , even to the inner house , and outside , and by all the wall all around inside and outside , by measure .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits ' breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors were toward the north .
for they were in three stories , and they didn 't have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the uppermost ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
the wall that was outside by the side of the rooms , toward the outer court before the rooms , its length was fifty cubits .
for the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits : and behold , before the temple were one hundred cubits .
according to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one enters into them .
he measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed all around .
he measured it on the four sides : it had a wall around it , the length five hundred , and the breadth five hundred , to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
the upper altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns .
the altar hearth shall be twelve [ cubits ] long by twelve broad , square in the four sides of it .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
you shall bring them near to Yahweh , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
you shall tell the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
you have not performed the duty of my holy things ; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves .
because they ministered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yahweh , and they shall bear their iniquity .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordinances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts ; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy .
of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty @-@ five thousand , and a breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary , which is most holy .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
in the first [ month ] , in the fourteenth day of the month , you shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering .
he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for a bull , and an ephah for a ram , and a Hin of oil to an ephah .
the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
thus says the Lord Yahweh : if the prince give a gift to any of his sons , it is his inheritance , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
in the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed , forty [ cubits ] long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ankles .
now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
but the miry places of it , and its marshes , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer Hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
the border from the sea , shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus ; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath . this is the north side .
the east side , between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead , and the land of Israel , shall be the Jordan ; from the [ north ] border to the east sea you shall measure . this is the east side .
the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh , to the brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side southward .
it shall happen , that in what tribe the stranger lives , there you shall give him his inheritance , says the Lord Yahweh .
by the border of Dan , from the east side to the west side , Asher , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Naphtali , from the east side to the west side , Manasseh , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Manasseh , from the east side to the west side , Ephraim , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Reuben , from the east side to the west side , Judah , one [ portion ] .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
it shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the Levites .
the five thousand that are left in the breadth , in front of the twenty @-@ five thousand , shall be for common use , for the city , for dwelling and for suburbs ; and the city shall be in its midst .
the city shall have suburbs : toward the north two hundred fifty , and toward the south two hundred fifty , and toward the east two hundred fifty , and toward the west two hundred fifty .
this is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , says the Lord Yahweh .
it shall be eighteen thousand [ reeds ] around : and the name of the city from that day shall be , Yahweh is there .
now among these were , of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah :
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of ten days their faces appeared fairer , and they were fatter in flesh , than all the youths who ate of the king 's dainties .
so the steward took away their dainties , and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language , O king , live forever : tell your servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if you don 't make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night . then Daniel blessed the God of heaven .
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen hereafter ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face , and worshiped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
then the herald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , peoples , nations , and languages ,
that whenever you hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up ;
and whoever doesn 't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
then Nebuchadnezzar in [ his ] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . then they brought these men before the king .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their Mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
he answered , Look , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they are unharmed ; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation :
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dominion to the end of the earth .
therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable to you , and break off your sins by righteousness , and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor ; if there may be a lengthening of your tranquility .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
now I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise and extol and honor the King of heaven ; for all his works are truth , and his ways justice ; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
you , king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
this is the interpretation of the thing : Mene ; God has numbered your kingdom , and brought it to an end ;
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which doesn 't alter .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
Daniel spoke and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
as for the rest of the animals , their dominion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
the male goat magnified himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
I heard a man 's voice between [ the banks of ] the Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
he said , Behold , I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation ; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end .
the ram which you saw , that had the two horns , they are the kings of Media and Persia .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus , of the seed of the Medes , who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans ,
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
at the beginning of your petitions the commandment went forth , and I have come to tell you ; for you are greatly beloved : therefore consider the matter , and understand the vision .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
also their gods , with their molten images , with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry captive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries .
he shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him ; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many .
he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
one said to the man clothed in linen , who was above the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
many shall purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
but go you your way until the end ; for you shall rest , and shall stand in your lot , at the end of the days .
Yahweh said to him , " Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
it will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . "
but I will have mercy on the house of Judah , and will save them by Yahweh their God , and will not save them by bow , sword , battle , horses , or horsemen . "
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thorns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can 't find her way .
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
I will betroth you to me forever . yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
Yahweh said to me , " Go again , love a woman loved by another , and an adulteress , even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel , though they turn to other gods , and love cakes of raisins . "
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the prostitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ephod or idols .
afterward the children of Israel shall return , and seek Yahweh their God , and David their king , and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days .
hear the word of Yahweh , you children of Israel ; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest .
they sacrifice on the tops of the mountains , and burn incense on the hills , under oaks and poplars and terebinths , because its shade is good . therefore your daughters play the prostitute , and your brides commit adultery .
I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hidden from me ; for now , Ephraim , you have played the prostitute . Israel is defiled .
their deeds won 't allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don 't know Yahweh .
they will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh ; but they won 't find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
the princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark . I will pour out my wrath on them like water .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
in the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing . there is prostitution in Ephraim . Israel is defiled .
they are all adulterers . they are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring , from the kneading of the dough , until it is leavened .
for they have prepared their heart like an oven , while they lie in wait . their baker sleeps all the night . in the morning it burns as a flaming fire .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them , as their congregation has heard .
woe to them ! for they have wandered from me . destruction to them ! for they have trespassed against me . though I would redeem them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they return , but not to the Most High . they are like a faulty bow . their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue . this will be their derision in the land of Egypt .
let Samaria throw out his calf idol ! my anger burns against them ! how long will it be until they are capable of purity ?
for this is even from Israel ! the workman made it , and it is no God ; indeed , the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
for Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces ; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities ; but I will send a fire on his cities , and it will devour its fortresses . "
they won 't dwell in Yahweh 's land ; but Ephraim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
for , behold , they have gone away from destruction . Egypt will gather them up . Memphis will bury them . nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver . thorns will be in their tents .
a prophet watches over Ephraim with my God . a Fowler 's snare is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
Ephraim is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
my God will cast them away , because they did not listen to him ; and they will be wanderers among the nations .
surely now they will say , " We have no king ; for we don 't fear Yahweh ; and the king , what can he do for us ? "
it also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king . Ephraim will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
when it is my desire , I will chastise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh ; so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck . I will set a rider on Ephraim . Judah will plow . Jacob will break his clods .
you have plowed wickedness . you have reaped iniquity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle roar will arise among your people , and all your fortresses will be destroyed , as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle . the mother was dashed in pieces with her children .
they called to them , so they went from them . they sacrificed to the Baals , and burned incense to engraved images .
the sword will fall on their cities , and will destroy the bars of their gates , and will put an end to their plans .
Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood , and the house of Israel with deceit . Judah still strays from God , and is unfaithful to the Holy One .
" but I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
Jacob fled into the country of Aram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended flocks and herds .
I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will devour them like a lioness . the wild animal will tear them .
I will ransom them from the power of Sheol . I will redeem them from death ! death , where are your plagues ? Sheol , where is your destruction ? " compassion will be hidden from my eyes .
Samaria will bear her guilt ; for she has rebelled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . "
hear this , you elders , And listen , all you inhabitants of the land . has this ever happened in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
wake up , you drunkards , and weep ! wail , all you drinkers of wine , because of the sweet wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the fangs of a lioness .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fig tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
be confounded , you farmers ! wail , you vineyard keepers ; for the wheat and for the barley ; for the harvest of the field has perished .
sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yahweh , your God , and cry to Yahweh .
alas for the day ! for the day of Yahweh is at hand , and it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
the seeds rot under their clods . the granaries are laid desolate . the barns are broken down , for the grain has withered .
how the animals groan ! the herds of livestock are perplexed , because they have no pasture . yes , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
Yahweh , I cry to you , For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water brooks have dried up , And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
their appearance is as the appearance of horses , and as horsemen , so do they run .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
neither does one jostle another ; they march everyone in his path , and they burst through the defenses , and don 't break ranks .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
the earth quakes before them . the heavens tremble . the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
who knows ? he may turn and Relent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh , your God .
Yahweh answered his people , " Behold , I will send you grain , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .

you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Yahweh , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen afterward , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . your old men will dream dreams . your young men will see visions .
proclaim this among the nations : " prepare for war ! stir up the mighty men . let all the warriors draw near . let them come up .
hurry and come , all you surrounding nations , and gather yourselves together . " cause your mighty ones to come down there , Yahweh .
" let the nations arouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
put in the sickle ; for the harvest is ripe . come , tread , for the winepress is full , the vats overflow , for their wickedness is great . "
Egypt will be a desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .

thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to Edom ;
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , and it will devour its palaces .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Tyre , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to Edom , and didn 't remember the brotherly covenant ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Moab , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime ;
and I will cut off the judge from their midst , and will kill all its princes with him , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
they trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same maiden , to profane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
I raised up some of your sons for prophets , and some of your young men for Nazirites . isn 't this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yahweh .
" but you gave the Nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , ' Don 't prophesy ! '
behold , I will crush you in your place , as a cart crushes that is full of grain .
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won 't escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day , " says Yahweh .
" you only have I chosen of all the families of the earth . therefore I will punish you for all of your sins . "

but don 't seek Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal , and don 't pass to Beersheba : for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and Bethel shall come to nothing .
seek Yahweh , and you will live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it devour , and there be no one to quench it in Bethel .
therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time , for it is an evil time .
in all vineyards there will be wailing ; for I will pass through the midst of you , " says Yahweh .
yes , though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals .

therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , " says Yahweh , whose name is the God of Armies .
those who put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
who lie on beds of ivory , and stretch themselves on their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive ; and the feasting and lounging will end .
" for , behold , Yahweh commands , and the great house will be smashed to pieces , and the little house into bits .
do horses run on the rocky crags ? does one plow there with oxen ? but you have turned justice into poison , and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness ;
you who rejoice in a thing of nothing , who say , ' Haven 't we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength ? '
then I said , " Lord Yahweh , stop , I beg you ! how could Jacob stand ? for he is small . "
thus he showed me and behold , the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line , with a plumb line in his hand .
then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , " Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel . the land is not able to bear all his words .
Amaziah also said to Amos , " You seer , go , flee away into the land of Judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
then Amos answered Amaziah , " I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was a herdsman , and a farmer of sycamore figs ;
now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh : ' you say , Don 't prophesy against Israel , and don 't preach against the house of Isaac . '
won 't the land tremble for this , and everyone mourn who dwells in it ? yes , it will rise up wholly like the River ; and it will be stirred up and sink again , like the River of Egypt .

for the violence done to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will be cut off forever .
Don 't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don 't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .
for the day of Yahweh is near all the nations ! as you have done , it will be done to you . your deeds will return upon your own head .
for as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink continually . yes , they will drink , swallow down , and will be as though they had not been .
but in Mount Zion , there will be those who escape , and it will be holy . the house of Jacob will possess their possessions .
those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau , and those of the lowland , the Philistines . they will possess the field of Ephraim , and the field of Samaria . Benjamin will possess Gilead .
but Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
so the shipmaster came to him , and said to him , " What do you mean , sleeper ? arise , call on your God ! maybe your God will notice us , so that we won 't perish . "
then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said to him , " What is this that you have done ? " for the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh , because he had told them .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stormy .
but let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mightily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .

pass on , inhabitant of Shaphir , in nakedness and shame . the inhabitant of Zaanan won 't come out . the wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good , because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem .
therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath . the houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel .
I will yet bring to you , inhabitant of Mareshah . he who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam .
woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they covet fields , and seize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
shall it be said , O house of Jacob : " is the Spirit of Yahweh angry ? are these his doings ? Don 't my words do good to him who walks blamelessly ? "
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yahweh at their head .
I said , " Please listen , you heads of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel : isn 't it for you to know justice ?
you who hate the good , and love the evil ; who tear off their skin , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then they will cry to Yahweh , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
but they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken .
but they don 't know the thoughts of Yahweh , neither do they understand his counsel ; for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .

let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries , and let all of your enemies be cut off .
hear , you mountains , Yahweh 's controversy , and you enduring foundations of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people , and he will contend with Israel .
for I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage . I sent before you Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
how shall I come before Yahweh , and bow myself before the exalted God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves a year old ?
will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams ? with tens of thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience ? the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?

the nations will see and be ashamed of all their might . they will lay their hand on their mouth . their ears will be deaf .
who is a God like you , who pardons iniquity , and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage ? he doesn 't retain his anger forever , because he delights in loving kindness .
you will give truth to Jacob , and mercy to Abraham , as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old .
Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges . Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath . Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries , and he maintains wrath against his enemies .

the mountains quake before him , and the hills melt away . the earth trembles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who dwell in it .
who can stand before his indignation ? who can endure the fierceness of his anger ? his wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken apart by him .
what do you plot against Yahweh ? he will make a full end . affliction won 't rise up the second time .
thus says Yahweh : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have afflicted you , I will afflict you no more .

the lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his caves with the kill , and his dens with prey .
the noise of the whip , the noise of the rattling of wheels , prancing horses , and bounding chariots ,
because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute , the mistress of witchcraft , who sells nations through her prostitution , and families through her witchcraft .

then he sweeps by like the wind , and goes on . he is indeed guilty , whose strength is his god . "
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the hook . he catches them in his net , and gathers them in his dragnet . therefore he rejoices and is glad .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ramparts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hurries toward the end , and won 't prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won 't delay .

" woe to him who gives his neighbor drink , pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk , so that you may gaze at their naked bodies !
you are filled with shame , and not glory . you will also drink , and be exposed ! the cup of Yahweh 's right hand will come around to you , and disgrace will cover your glory .
he stood , and shook the earth . he looked , and made the nations tremble . the ancient mountains were crumbled . the age @-@ old hills collapsed . his ways are eternal .
the mountains saw you , and were afraid . the storm of waters passed by . the deep roared and lifted up its hands on high .
you went forth for the salvation of your people , for the salvation of your anointed . you crushed the head of the land of wickedness . you stripped them head to foot . Selah .

before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff , before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you , before the day of Yahweh 's anger comes on you .

then Haggai answered , " ' So is this people , and so is this nation before me , ' says Yahweh ; ' and so is every work of their hands . that which they offer there is unclean .
through all that time , when one came to a heap of twenty measures , there were only ten . when one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty , there were only twenty .
I struck you with blight , mildew , and hail in all the work of your hands ; yet you didn 't turn to me , ' says Yahweh .
the Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty @-@ fourth day of the month , saying ,
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,

then I asked , ' My lord , what are these ? ' " the angel who talked with me said to me , " I will show you what these are . "
the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered , " They are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth . "
so the angel who talked with me said to me , " proclaim , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies : " I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy .
I am very angry with the nations that are at ease ; for I was but a little displeased , but they added to the calamity . "
I asked the angel who talked with me , " What are these ? " he answered me , " These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem . "
then I asked , " Where are you going ? " he said to me , " To measure Jerusalem , to see what is its breadth and what is its length . "

I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me , saying , " What are these , my lord ? "
" the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house . his hands shall also finish it ; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
then I asked him , " What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it ? "
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are beside the two golden spouts , that pour the golden oil out of themselves ? "
then again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a flying scroll .
then the angel who talked with me came forward , and said to me , " Lift up now your eyes , and see what is this that is appearing . "
he said , " This is Wickedness " ; and he threw her down into the midst of the ephah basket ; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth .
then I said to the angel who talked with me , " Where are these carrying the ephah basket ? "
the angel answered me , " These are the four winds of the sky , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
then he called to me , and spoke to me , saying , " Behold , those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country . "

and to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of Armies , and to the prophets , saying , " Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these so many years ? "
yes , they made their hearts as hard as flint , lest they might hear the law , and the words which Yahweh of Armies had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets . therefore great wrath came from Yahweh of Armies .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I am jealous for her with great wrath . "
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
and I will bring them , and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem ; and they will be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness . "
so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah . Don 't be afraid .

and the inhabitants of one shall go to another , saying , ' Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh , and to seek Yahweh of Armies . I will go also . '
yes , many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem , and to entreat the favor of Yahweh . "

wail , fir tree , for the cedar has fallen , because the stately ones are destroyed . wail , you oaks of Bashan , for the strong forest has come down .
a voice of the wailing of the shepherds ! for their glory is destroyed : a voice of the roaring of young lions ! for the pride of the Jordan is ruined .
their buyers slaughter them , and go unpunished . those who sell them say , ' Blessed be Yahweh , for I am rich ; ' and their own shepherds don 't pity them .
" behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples , and on Judah also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
the chieftains of Judah will say in their heart , ' The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God . '
in that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . he who is feeble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Yahweh before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
in that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem , like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
the land will mourn , every family apart ; the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
the family of the house of Levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the Shimeites apart , and their wives apart ;
one will say to him , ' What are these wounds between your arms ? ' then he will answer , ' Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yahweh , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
it will happen in that day , that there will not be light , cold , or frost .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clothing , in great abundance .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the donkey , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn 't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , on them there will be no rain .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don 't go up to keep the feast of tents .
in that day there will be on the bells of the horses , " HOLY TO Yahweh " ; and the pots in Yahweh 's house will be like the bowls before the altar .
" now , please entreat the favor of God , that he may be gracious to us . with this , will he accept any of you ? " says Yahweh of Armies .
you will know that I have sent this commandment to you , that my covenant may be with Levi , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" my covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me ; and he was reverent toward me , and stood in awe of my name .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies .
" therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people , according to the way you have not kept my ways , but have had respect for persons in the law .
Judah has dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves , and has married the daughter of a foreign god .
this again you do : you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears , with weeping , and with sighing , because he doesn 't regard the offering any more , neither receives it with good will at your hand .
" but who can endure the day of his coming ? and who will stand when he appears ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like launderer 's soap ;
and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver , and he will purify the sons of Levi , and refine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness .
" your words have been stout against me , " says Yahweh . " yet you say , ' What have we spoken against you ? '
you have said , ' It is vain to serve God ; ' and ' What profit is it that we have followed his instructions , and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies ?
they shall be mine , " says Yahweh of Armies , " my own possession in the day that I make , and I will spare them , as a man spares his own son who serves him .
then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him who serves God and him who doesn 't serve him .
you shall tread down the wicked ; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make , " says Yahweh of Armies .
he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers , lest I come and strike the earth with a curse . "
after the exile to Babylon , Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
Joseph , her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , intended to put her away secretly .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name Jesus , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod , behold , wise men from the east came to Jerusalem , saying ,
'You Bethlehem , land of Judah , are in no way least among the princes of Judah : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall shepherd my people , Israel . ' "
and was there until the death of Herod ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
" a voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation , weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; she wouldn 't be comforted , because they are no more . "
but when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying ,
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
and came and lived in a city called Nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets : " he will be called a Nazarene . "
but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism , he said to them , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
" even now the axe lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you in water for repentance , but he who comes after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to carry . he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit .
behold , a voice out of the heavens said , " This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . "
but he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God . ' "
again , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory .
leaving Nazareth , he came and lived in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
" the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , toward the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has dawned . "
rejoice , and be exceedingly glad , for great is your reward in heaven . for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
even so , let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
" Don 't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets . I didn 't come to destroy , but to fulfill .
for I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
most certainly I tell you , you shall by no means get out of there , until you have paid the last penny .
" it was also said , ' Whoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorce , '
but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife , except for the cause of sexual immorality , makes her an adulteress ; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery .
nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
give to him who asks you , and don 't turn away him who desires to borrow from you .
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you ,
" be careful that you don 't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
in praying , don 't use vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do ; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking .
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" Don 't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
" the lamp of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
" no one can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other ; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other . you can 't serve both God and Mammon .
see the birds of the sky , that they don 't sow , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns . your heavenly Father feeds them . aren 't you of much more value than they ?
why are you anxious about clothing ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . they don 't toil , neither do they spin ,
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
why do you see the speck that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
you hypocrite ! first remove the beam out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother 's eye .
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
how narrow is the gate , and restricted is the way that leads to life ! few are those who find it .
not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven ; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
" everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
behold , a leper came to him and worshiped him , saying , " Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . "
Jesus stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
Jesus said to him , " See that you tell nobody , but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . "
and saying , " Lord , my servant lies in the house paralyzed , grievously tormented . "
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and will sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven ,
when Jesus came into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick with a fever .
when evening came , they brought to him many possessed with demons . he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying : " he took our infirmities , and bore our diseases . "
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . "
behold , a violent storm came up on the sea , so much that the boat was covered with the waves , but he was asleep .
he said to them , " Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , rebuked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
the men marveled , saying , " What kind of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
when he came to the other side , into the country of the Gergesenes , two people possessed by demons met him there , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that nobody could pass that way .
those who fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , including what happened to those who were possessed with demons .
behold , they brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a bed . Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , cheer up ! your sins are forgiven you . "
but you go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
then John 's disciples came to him , saying , " Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples don 't fast ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
neither do people put new wine into old wineskins , or else the skins would burst , and the wine be spilled , and the skins ruined . no , they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved . "
but Jesus , turning around and seeing her , said , " Daughter , cheer up ! your faith has made you well . " and the woman was made well from that hour .
when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the flute players , and the crowd in noisy disorder ,
he said to them , " Make room , because the girl isn 't dead , but sleeping . " they were ridiculing him .
as Jesus passed by from there , two blind men followed him , calling out and saying , " Have mercy on us , son of David ! "
when he had come into the house , the blind men came to him . Jesus said to them , " Do you believe that I am able to do this ? " they told him , " Yes , Lord . "
Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these . the first , Simon , who is called Peter ; Andrew , his brother ; James the son of Zebedee ; John , his brother ;
Philip ; Bartholomew ; Thomas ; Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus ; Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
Jesus sent these twelve out , and commanded them , saying , " Don 't go among the Gentiles , and don 't enter into any city of the Samaritans .
yes , and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
but when they deliver you up , don 't be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
Don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
he who seeks his life will lose it ; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
it happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples , he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities .
as these went their way , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? behold , those who wear soft clothing are in king 's houses .
but why did you go out ? to see a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
but I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to Hades . for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
but the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , " Behold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbath day , the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath , and are guiltless ?
but if you had known what this means , ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guiltless .
and behold there was a man with a withered hand . they asked him , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? " that they might accuse him .
then he told the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he stretched it out ; and it was restored whole , just like the other .
but the Pharisees went out , and conspired against him , how they might destroy him .
" behold , my servant whom I have chosen ; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit on him . he will proclaim justice to the nations .
he won 't break a bruised reed . he won 't quench a smoking flax , until he leads justice to victory .
then one possessed by a demon , blind and mute , was brought to him and he healed him , so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , " This man does not cast out demons , except by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
but if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come upon you .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will plunder his house .
therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men .
" either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by its fruit .
but he answered them , " An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet .
for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn 't find it .
he spoke to them many things in parables , saying , " Behold , a farmer went out to sow .
others fell on rocky ground , where they didn 't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
he answered them , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it is not given to them .
therefore I speak to them in parables , because seeing they don 't see , and hearing , they don 't hear , neither do they understand .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; Seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
yet he has no root in himself , but endures for a while . when oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he stumbles .
what was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then the darnel weeds appeared also .
the servants of the householder came and said to him , ' Sir , didn 't you sow good seed in your field ? where did this darnel come from ? '
" he said to them , ' An enemy has done this . ' " the servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
" but he said , ' No , lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds , you root up the wheat with them .
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field ;
then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field . "
the enemy who sowed them is the devil . the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
and will cast them into the furnace of fire . there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
coming into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , " Where did this man get this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
they were offended by him . but Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house . "
and said to his servants , " This is John the Baptizer . he is risen from the dead . that is why these powers work in him . "
for Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife .
when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
she , being prompted by her mother , said , " Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer . "
now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat , to a deserted place apart . when the multitudes heard it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , " It 's a ghost ! " and they cried out for fear .
those who were in the boat came and worshiped him , saying , " You are truly the Son of God ! "
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
" why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders ? for they don 't wash their hands when they eat bread . "
but you say , ' Whoever may tell his father or his mother , " Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God , "
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , sexual sins , thefts , false testimony , and blasphemies .
behold , a Canaanite woman came out from those borders , and cried , saying , " Have mercy on me , Lord , you son of David ! my daughter is severely demonized ! "
Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
the disciples said to him , " Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude ? "
Jesus said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? " they said , " Seven , and a few small fish . "
and he took the seven loaves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . " he left them , and departed .
then they understood that he didn 't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
Peter took him aside , and began to rebuke him , saying , " Far be it from you , Lord ! this will never be done to you . "
then Jesus said to his disciples , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and forfeits his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , " Don 't tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
and they will kill him , and the third day he will be raised up . " they were exceedingly sorry .
when they had come to Capernaum , those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter , and said , " doesn 't your teacher pay the didrachma ? "
in that hour the disciples came to Jesus , saying , " Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven ? "
and said , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you turn , and become as little children , you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
see that you don 't despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
" if your brother sins against you , go , show him his fault between you and him alone . if he listens to you , you have gained back your brother .
the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
" so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
Shouldn 't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant , even as I had mercy on you ? '
his lord was angry , and delivered him to the tormentors , until he should pay all that was due to him .
they asked him , " Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce , and divorce her ? "
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another , commits adultery ; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery . "
he said to him , " Why do you call me good ? no one is good but one , that is , God . but if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
the young man said to him , " All these things I have observed from my youth . what do I still lack ? "
but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sad , for he was one who had great possessions .
Jesus said to his disciples , " Most certainly I say to you , a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty .
looking at them , Jesus said , " With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . "
to them he said , ' You also go into the vineyard , and whatever is right I will give you . ' so they went their way .
" they said to him , ' Because no one has hired us . ' " he said to them , ' You also go into the vineyard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
when evening had come , the lord of the vineyard said to his manager , ' Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last to the first . '
saying , ' These last have spent one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat ! '
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
isn 't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
so the last will be first , and the first last . for many are called , but few are chosen . "
as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them ,
" behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death ,
but Jesus summoned them , and said , " You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
behold , two blind men sitting by the road , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
" tell the daughter of Zion , behold , your King comes to you , humble , and riding on a donkey , on a colt , the foal of a donkey . "
he came to the second , and said the same thing . he answered , ' I go , sir , ' but he didn 't go .
when the season for the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruit .
they told him , " He will miserably destroy those miserable men , and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers , who will give him the fruit in its season . "
he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , but on whomever it will fall , it will scatter him as dust . "
when they sought to seize him , they feared the multitudes , because they considered him to be a prophet .
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast , but they would not come .
" then he said to his servants , ' The wedding is ready , but those who were invited weren 't worthy .
but when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who didn 't have on wedding clothing ,
and he said to him , ' Friend , how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing ? ' he was speechless .
'the Lord said to my Lord , sit on my right hand , until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ? '
no one was able to answer him a word , neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth .
woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte ; and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves .
" woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah , whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar .
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
then they will deliver you up to oppression , and will kill you . you will be hated by all of the nations for my name 's sake .
this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
" when , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
" then if any man tells you , ' Behold , here is the Christ , ' or , ' There , ' don 't believe it .
if therefore they tell you , ' Behold , he is in the wilderness , ' don 't go out ; ' Behold , he is in the inner rooms , ' don 't believe it .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
" now from the fig tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
most certainly I tell you , this generation will not pass away , until all these things are accomplished .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
and they didn 't know until the flood came , and took them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord has set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
and will cut him in pieces , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites . there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be .
" then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went out to meet the bridegroom .
the foolish said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
while they went away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was shut .
to one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his own ability . then he went on his journey .
he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents . behold , I have gained another five talents besides them . '
" his lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . you have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . enter into the joy of your lord . '
" his lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . you have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . enter into the joy of your lord . '
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
you ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest .
throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . '
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
before him all the nations will be gathered , and he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
then the King will tell those on his right hand , ' Come , blessed of my Father , inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world ;
for I was hungry , and you gave me food to eat . I was thirsty , and you gave me drink . I was a stranger , and you took me in .
when did we see you as a stranger , and take you in ; or naked , and clothe you ?
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' Depart from me , you cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
for I was hungry , and you didn 't give me food to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me no drink ;
I was a stranger , and you didn 't take me in ; naked , and you didn 't clothe me ; sick , and in prison , and you didn 't visit me . '
" then they will also answer , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and didn 't help you ? '
" you know that after two days the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified . "
however , knowing this , Jesus said to them , " Why do you trouble the woman ? because she has done a good work for me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
they were exceedingly sorrowful , and each began to ask him , " It isn 't me , is it , Lord ? "
Judas , who betrayed him , answered , " It isn 't me , is it , Rabbi ? " he said to him , " You said it . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , gave thanks for it , and broke it . he gave to the disciples , and said , " Take , eat ; this is my body . "
for this is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many for the remission of sins .
but I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father 's Kingdom . "
but Peter answered him , " Even if all will be made to stumble because of you , I will never be made to stumble . "
he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " What , couldn 't you watch with me for one hour ?
watch and pray , that you don 't enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
now he who betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , " Whoever I kiss , he is the one . seize him . "
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
then Jesus said to him , " Put your sword back into its place , for all those who take the sword will die by the sword .
but all this has happened , that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . " then all the disciples left him , and fled .
but Peter followed him from a distance , to the court of the high priest , and entered in and sat with the officers , to see the end .
the high priest stood up , and said to him , " Have you no answer ? what is this that these testify against you ? "
then the high priest tore his clothing , saying , " He has spoken blasphemy ! why do we need any more witnesses ? behold , now you have heard his blasphemy .
now Peter was sitting outside in the court , and a maid came to him , saying , " You were also with Jesus , the Galilean ! "
but he denied it before them all , saying , " I don 't know what you are talking about . "
when he had gone out onto the porch , someone else saw him , and said to those who were there , " This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter , " Surely you are also one of them , for your speech makes you known . "
now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus was condemned , felt remorse , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
he threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary , and departed . he went away and hanged himself .
when therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said to them , " Whom do you want me to release to you ? Barabbas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? "
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
but the governor answered them , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " they said , " Barabbas ! "
then the governor 's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium , and gathered the whole garrison together against him .
when they had mocked him , they took the robe off of him , and put his clothes on him , and led him away to crucify him .
they set up over his head the accusation against him written , " THIS IS JESUS , THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
and saying , " You who destroy the temple , and build it in three days , save yourself ! if you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! "
likewise the chief priests also mocking , with the scribes , the Pharisees , and the elders , said ,
" he saved others , but he can 't save himself . if he is the King of Israel , let him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in him .
he trusts in God . let God deliver him now , if he wants him ; for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
immediately one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him a drink .
the rest said , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to save him . "
behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the earth quaked and the rocks were split .
this man went to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body . then Pilate commanded the body to be given up .
now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
he is not here , for he has risen , just like he said . come , see the place where the Lord was lying .
go quickly and tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead , and behold , he goes before you into Galilee ; there you will see him . ' behold , I have told you . "
then Jesus said to them , " Don 't be afraid . go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee , and there they will see me . "
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
go , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
all the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him . they were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
he preached , saying , " After me comes he who is mightier than I , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen .
it happened in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
a voice came out of the sky , " You are my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , " What is this ? a new teaching ? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him ! "
now Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
he said to them , " Let 's go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also , because I came out for this reason . "
a leper came to him , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
and said to him , " See you say nothing to anybody , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even around the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on .
which is easier , to tell the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' Arise , and take up your bed , and walk ? '
he arose , and immediately took up the mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
as he passed by , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , " Follow me . " and he arose and followed him .
it happened , that he was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
Jesus said to them , " Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can 't fast .
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
the Pharisees said to him , " Behold , why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? "
how he entered into God 's house when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn 't press on him .
the unclean spirits , whenever they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , " You are the Son of God ! "
Andrew ; Philip ; Bartholomew ; Matthew ; Thomas ; James , the son of Alphaeus ; Thaddaeus ; Simon the Zealot ;
the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , " He has Beelzebul , " and , " By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons . "
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder , unless he first binds the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house .
most certainly I tell you , all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven , including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme ;
looking around at those who sat around him , he said , " Behold , my mother and my brothers !
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
these in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with joy .
those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
he said to them , " Take heed what you hear . with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you , and more will be given to you who hear .
yet when it is sown , grows up , and becomes greater than all the herbs , and puts out great branches , so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow . "
with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
a big wind storm arose , and the waves beat into the boat , so much that the boat was already filled .
he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion , and they woke him up , and told him , " Teacher , don 't you care that we are dying ? "
he awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace ! be still ! " the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
they were greatly afraid , and said to one another , " Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
those who fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the legion ; and they were afraid .
those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons , and about the pigs .
as he was entering into the boat , he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him .
he went his way , and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him , and everyone marveled .
when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
and begged him much , saying , " My little daughter is at the point of death . please come and lay your hands on her , that she may be made healthy , and live . "
having heard the things concerning Jesus , came up behind him in the crowd , and touched his clothes .
for she said , " If I just touch his clothes , I will be made well . "
his disciples said to him , " You see the multitude pressing against you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
while he was still speaking , people came from the synagogue ruler 's house saying , " Your daughter is dead . why bother the Teacher any more ? "
he came to the synagogue ruler 's house , and he saw an uproar , weeping , and great wailing .
Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . "
he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people , and healed them .
he called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
King Herod heard this , for his name had become known , and he said , " John the Baptizer has risen from the dead , and therefore these powers are at work in him . "
but others said , " He is Elijah . " others said , " He is a prophet , or like one of the prophets . "
but Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . he has risen from the dead . "
for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and kept him safe . when he heard him , he did many things , and he heard him gladly .
he swore to her , " Whatever you shall ask of me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . "
she came in immediately with haste to the king , and asked , " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter . "
the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
he said to them , " You come apart into a deserted place , and rest awhile . " for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
when it was late in the day , his disciples came to him , and said , " This place is deserted , and it is late in the day .
send them away , that they may go into the surrounding country and villages , and buy themselves bread , for they have nothing to eat . "
he said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? go see . " when they knew , they said , " Five , and two fish . "
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
seeing them distressed in rowing , for the wind was contrary to them , about the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea , and he would have passed by them ,
but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " Cheer up ! it is I ! Don 't be afraid . "
and ran around that whole region , and began to bring those who were sick , on their mats , to where they heard he was .
then the Pharisees , and some of the scribes gathered together to him , having come from Jerusalem .
they don 't eat when they come from the marketplace , unless they bathe themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : washings of cups , pitchers , bronze vessels , and couches . )
the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , " Why don 't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with unwashed hands ? "
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
making void the word of God by your tradition , which you have handed down . you do many things like this . "
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man .
for from within , out of the hearts of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , sexual sins , murders , thefts ,
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . he entered into a house , and didn 't want anyone to know it , but he couldn 't escape notice .
now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . she begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
he said to her , " For this saying , go your way . the demon has gone out of your daughter . "
he commanded them that they should tell no one , but the more he commanded them , so much the more widely they proclaimed it .
they were astonished beyond measure , saying , " He has done all things well . he makes even the deaf hear , and the mute speak ! "
in those days , when there was a very great multitude , and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to himself , and said to them ,
" I have compassion on the multitude , because they have stayed with me now three days , and have nothing to eat .
if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
he asked them , " How many loaves do you have ? " they said , " Seven . "
he sighed deeply in his spirit , and said , " Why does this generation seek a sign ? most certainly I tell you , no sign will be given to this generation . "
he warned them , saying , " Take heed : beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . "
when I broke the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " they told him , " Twelve . "
he sent him away to his house , saying , " Don 't enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
Jesus went out , with his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi . on the way he asked his disciples , " Who do men say that I am ? "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power . "
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
Peter answered Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
but I tell you that Elijah has come , and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to , even as it is written about him . "
they brought him to him , and when he saw him , immediately the spirit convulsed him , and he fell on the ground , wallowing and foaming at the mouth .
he asked his father , " How long has it been since this has come to him ? " he said , " From childhood .
often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water , to destroy him . but if you can do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . "
when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , " You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and never enter him again ! "
having cried out , and convulsed greatly , it came out of him . the boy became like one dead ; so much that most of them said , " He is dead . "
he came to Capernaum , and when he was in the house he asked them , " What were you arguing among yourselves on the way ? "
he took a little child , and set him in their midst . taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck .
if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
salt is good , but if the salt has lost its saltiness , with what will you season it ? have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
he arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . multitudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
they were bringing to him little children , that he should touch them , but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them .
as he was going out into the way , one ran to him , knelt before him , and asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? "
the disciples were amazed at his words . but Jesus answered again , " Children , how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
Jesus , looking at them , said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God , for all things are possible with God . "
James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came near to him , saying , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we will ask . "
but Jesus said to them , " You don 't know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
they said to him , " We are able . " Jesus said to them , " You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink , and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ;
but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give , but for whom it has been prepared . "
they came to Jericho . as he went out from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the road .
Jesus asked him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " the blind man said to him , " Rabboni , that I may see again . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your faith has made you well . " immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs him ; ' and immediately he will send him back here . "
some of those who stood there asked them , " What are you doing , untying the young donkey ? "
the chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . for they feared him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone ; so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your transgressions .
they came again to Jerusalem , and as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders came to him ,
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
haven 't you even read this Scripture : ' the stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner .
they tried to seize him , but they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them . they left him , and went away .
one of the scribes came , and heard them questioning together . knowing that he had answered them well , asked him , " Which commandment is the greatest of all ? "
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
the second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' there is no other commandment greater than these . "
when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the Kingdom of God . " no one dared ask him any question after that .
Jesus responded , as he taught in the temple , " How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
in his teaching he said to them , " Beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes , and to get greetings in the marketplaces ,
Jesus sat down opposite the treasury , and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury . many who were rich cast in much .
he called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings ! "
Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? there will not be left here one stone on another , which will not be thrown down . "
" tell us , when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled ? "
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when you see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ,
for in those days there will be oppression , such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the sake of the chosen ones , whom he picked out , he shortened the days .
" now from the fig tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
even so you also , when you see these things coming to pass , know that it is near , at the doors .
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
watch therefore , for you don 't know when the lord of the house is coming , whether at evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning ;
but there were some who were indignant among themselves , saying , " Why has this ointment been wasted ?
for you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might deliver him to them .
on the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the Passover , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover ? "
he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , " Go into the city , and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water . follow him ,
and wherever he enters in , tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? " '
they began to be sorrowful , and to ask him one by one , " Surely not I ? " and another said , " Surely not I ? "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had blessed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body . "
he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them . they all drank of it .
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God . "
Jesus said to him , " Most certainly I tell you , that you today , even this night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . "
he said , " Abba , Father , all things are possible to you . please remove this cup from me . however , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
watch and pray , that you may not enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
now he who betrayed him had given them a sign , saying , " whomever I will kiss , that is he . seize him , and lead him away safely . "
I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me . but this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled . "
a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
they led Jesus away to the high priest . all the chief priests , the elders , and the scribes came together with him .
" we heard him say , ' I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . ' "
the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , " Have you no answer ? what is it which these testify against you ? "
but he stayed quiet , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? "
you have heard the blasphemy ! what do you think ? " they all condemned him to be worthy of death .
some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to tell him , " Prophesy ! " the officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
but he began to curse , and to swear , " I don 't know this man of whom you speak ! "
but the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should release Barabbas to them instead .
Pilate , wishing to please the multitude , released Barabbas to them , and handed over Jesus , when he had flogged him , to be crucified .
when they had mocked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . they led him out to crucify him .
those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads , and saying , " Ha ! you who destroy the temple , and build it in three days ,
let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe him . " those who were crucified with him insulted him .
when the centurion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , " Truly this man was the Son of God ! "
Joseph of Arimathaea , a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God , came . he boldly went in to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
he bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
he said to them , " Don 't be amazed . you seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who has been crucified . he has risen . he is not here . behold , the place where they laid him !
they went out , and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had come on them . they said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
these signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak with new languages ;
they will take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it will in no way hurt them ; they will lay hands on the sick , and they will recover . "
they went out , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen .
even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us ,
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
but the angel said to him , " Don 't be afraid , Zacharias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
the angel answered him , " I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
it happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he departed to his house .
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . the virgin 's name was Mary .
having come in , the angel said to her , " Rejoice , you highly favored one ! the Lord is with you . blessed are you among women ! "
behold , you will conceive in your womb , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' Jesus . '
behold , Elizabeth , your relative , also has conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
it happened , when Elizabeth heard Mary 's greeting , that the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
she called out with a loud voice , and said , " Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
for behold , when the voice of your greeting came into my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy !
he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , " His name is John . " they all marveled .
all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , " What then will this child be ? " the hand of the Lord was with him .
Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
she brought forth her firstborn son , and she wrapped him in bands of cloth , and laid him in a feeding trough , because there was no room for them in the inn .
when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon . this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
he came in the Spirit into the temple . when the parents brought in the child , Jesus , that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law ,
and Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary , his mother , " Behold , this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel , and for a sign which is spoken against .
there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher ( she was of a great age , having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity ,
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . Joseph and his mother didn 't know it ,
when they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us this way ? behold , your father and I were anxiously looking for you . "
in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
every valley will be filled . every mountain and hill will be brought low . the crooked will become straight , and the rough ways smooth .
he answered them , " He who has two coats , let him give to him who has none . he who has food , let him do likewise . "
Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
the devil said to him , " I will give you all this authority , and their glory , for it has been delivered to me ; and I give it to whomever I want .
Jesus answered him , " Get behind me Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up . he entered , as was his custom , into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . he opened the book , and found the place where it was written ,
he closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
all testified about him , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth , and they said , " isn 't this Joseph 's son ? "
but truly I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the sky was shut up three years and six months , when a great famine came over all the land .
Elijah was sent to none of them , except to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , yet not one of them was cleansed , except Naaman , the Syrian . "
he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @-@ in @-@ law was afflicted with a great fever , and they begged him for her .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
now it happened , while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret .
he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon 's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . he sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat .
but Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , " Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . "
he commanded him to tell no one , " But go your way , and show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus .
the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , " Who is this that speaks blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but God alone ? "
which is easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven you ; ' or to say , ' Arise and walk ? '
after these things he went out , and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office , and said to him , " Follow me ! "
their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , " Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? "
they said to him , " Why do John 's disciples often fast and pray , likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink ? "
he said to them , " Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them . then they will fast in those days . "
he also told a parable to them . " no one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment , or else he will tear the new , and also the piece from the new will not match the old .
now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first , that he was going through the grain fields . his disciples plucked the heads of grain , and ate , rubbing them in their hands .
but some of the Pharisees said to them , " Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? "
Jesus , answering them , said , " Haven 't you read what David did when he was hungry , he , and those who were with him ;
how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? "
but he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man who had the withered hand , " Rise up , and stand in the middle . " he arose and stood .
then Jesus said to them , " I will ask you something : is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? "
he lifted up his eyes to his disciples , and said , " Blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God .
blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall exclude and mock you , and throw out your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake .
rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven , for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets .
woe to you , you who are full now , for you will be hungry . woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
give to everyone who asks you , and don 't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again .
if you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? for even sinners love those who love them .
but love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing back ; and your reward will be great , and you will be children of the Most High ; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil .
Don 't judge , and you won 't be judged . Don 't condemn , and you won 't be condemned . set free , and you will be set free .
he spoke a parable to them . " can the blind guide the blind ? won 't they both fall into a pit ?
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don 't gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and at the point of death .
when Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turned and said to the multitude who followed him , " I tell you , I have not found such great faith , no , not in Israel . "
it happened soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain . many of his disciples , along with a great multitude , went with him .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . many people of the city were with her .
he came near and touched the coffin , and the bearers stood still . he said , " Young man , I tell you , arise ! "
this report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea , and in all the surrounding region .
John , calling to himself two of his disciples , sent them to Jesus , saying , " Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for another ? "
when the men had come to him , they said , " John the Baptizer has sent us to you , saying , ' Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? ' "
when John 's messengers had departed , he began to tell the multitudes about John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man clothed in soft clothing ? behold , those who are gorgeously dressed , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
but what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he of whom it is written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
behold , a woman in the city who was a sinner , when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee 's house , she brought an alabaster jar of ointment .
standing behind at his feet weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and she wiped them with the hair of her head , kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves , " Who is this who even forgives sins ? "
" the farmer went out to sow his seed . as he sowed , some fell along the road , and it was trampled under foot , and the birds of the sky devoured it .
other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
be careful therefore how you hear . for whoever has , to him will be given ; and whoever doesn 't have , from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has . "
it was told him by some saying , " Your mother and your brothers stand outside , desiring to see you . "
now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain , and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those . he allowed them .
the demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
all the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were very much afraid . he entered into the boat , and returned .
it happened , when Jesus returned , that the multitude welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and begged him to come into his house ,
a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living on physicians , and could not be healed by any ,
he said to her , " Daughter , cheer up . your faith has made you well . go in peace . "
while he still spoke , one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house came , saying to him , " Your daughter is dead . Don 't trouble the Teacher . "
when he came to the house , he didn 't allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the child , and her mother .
but he put them all outside , and taking her by the hand , he called , saying , " Child , arise ! "
now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him ; and he was very perplexed , because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead ,
but the multitudes , perceiving it , followed him . he welcomed them , and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God , and he cured those who needed healing .
but he said to them , " You give them something to eat . " they said , " We have no more than five loaves and two fish , unless we should go and buy food for all these people . "
for they were about five thousand men . he said to his disciples , " Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each . "
they answered , " ' John the Baptizer , ' but others say , ' Elijah , ' and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again . "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world , and loses or forfeits his own self ?
it happened about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up onto the mountain to pray .
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met him .
while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
they were all astonished at the majesty of God . but while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did , he said to his disciples ,
Jesus , perceiving the reasoning of their hearts , took a little child , and set him by his side ,
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
for the Son of Man didn 't come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
he said to another , " Follow me ! " but he said , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
but Jesus said to him , " Leave the dead to bury their own dead , but you go and announce the Kingdom of God . "
but Jesus said to him , " No one , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the Kingdom of God . "
now after these things , the Lord also appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place , where he was about to come .
heal the sick who are therein , and tell them , ' The Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
'Even the dust from your city that clings to us , we wipe off against you . nevertheless know this , that the Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
" woe to you , Chorazin ! woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
whoever listens to you listens to me , and whoever rejects you rejects me . whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me . "
behold , I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy . nothing will in any way hurt you .
nevertheless , don 't rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . he set him on his own animal , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
it happened as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
but Martha was distracted with much serving , and she came up to him , and said , " Lord , don 't you care that my sister left me to serve alone ? ask her therefore to help me . "
but one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the good part , which will not be taken away from her . "
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
but some of them said , " He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
the unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
for even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will also the Son of Man be to this generation .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
now as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him . he went in , and sat at the table .
the Lord said to him , " Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness .
but give for gifts to the needy those things which are within , and behold , all things will be clean to you .
but woe to you Pharisees ! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb , but you bypass justice and the love of God . you ought to have done these , and not to have left the other undone .
woe to you ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
but I will warn you whom you should fear . fear him , who after he has killed , has power to cast into Gehenna . yes , I tell you , fear him .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
" I tell you , everyone who confesses me before men , him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God ;
when they bring you before the synagogues , the rulers , and the authorities , don 't be anxious how or what you will answer , or what you will say ;
but he said to him , " Man , who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? "
he spoke a parable to them , saying , " The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly .
he reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don 't have room to store my crops ? '
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
I will tell my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years . take your ease , eat , drink , be merry . " '
" but God said to him , ' You foolish one , tonight your soul is required of you . the things which you have prepared--whose will they be ? '
if then you aren 't able to do even the least things , why are you anxious about the rest ?
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith ?
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
the Lord said , " Who then is the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the right times ?
but if that servant says in his heart , ' My lord delays his coming , ' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ,
but I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans , whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
or those eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way . "
he spoke this parable . " a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it , and found none .
if it bears fruit , fine ; but if not , after that , you can cut it down . ' "
when Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , " Woman , you are freed from your infirmity . "
as he said these things , all his adversaries were disappointed , and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
he said , " What is the Kingdom of God like ? to what shall I compare it ?
one said to him , " Lord , are they few who are saved ? " he said to them ,
then you will begin to say , ' We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . '
he will say , ' I tell you , I don 't know where you come from . depart from me , all you workers of iniquity . '
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets , in the Kingdom of God , and yourselves being thrown outside .
behold , there are some who are last who will be first , and there are some who are first who will be last . "
on that same day , some Pharisees came , saying to him , " Get out of here , and go away , for Herod wants to kill you . "
he said to them , " Go and tell that fox , ' Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I complete my mission .
" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! how often I wanted to gather your children together , like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings , and you refused !
behold , your house is left to you desolate . I tell you , you will not see me , until you say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
but they were silent . he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
he answered them , " Which of you , if your son or an ox fell into a well , wouldn 't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? "
" when you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast , don 't sit in the best seat , since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him ,
and he who invited both of you would come and tell you , ' Make room for this person . ' then you would begin , with shame , to take the lowest place .
but when you make a feast , ask the poor , the maimed , the lame , or the blind ;
but he said to him , " A certain man made a great supper , and he invited many people .
they all as one began to make excuses . " the first said to him , ' I have bought a field , and I must go and see it . please have me excused . '
" another said , ' I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I must go try them out . please have me excused . '
or perhaps , when he has laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , everyone who sees begins to mock him ,
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ' Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! '
or what woman , if she had ten drachma coins , if she lost one drachma coin , wouldn 't light a lamp , sweep the house , and seek diligently until she found it ?
even so , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting . "
not many days after , the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country . there he wasted his property with riotous living .
when he had spent all of it , there arose a severe famine in that country , and he began to be in need .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
" but the father said to his servants , ' Bring out the best robe , and put it on him . put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet .
I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
calling each one of his lord 's debtors to him , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my lord ? '
he said , ' A hundred batos of oil . ' he said to him , ' Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . '
I tell you , make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon , so that when you fail , they may receive you into the eternal tents .
if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
no servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . you aren 't able to serve God and mammon . "
he said to them , " You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts . for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man 's table . yes , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
" but Abraham said , ' Son , remember that you , in your lifetime , received your good things , and Lazarus , in the same way , bad things . but now here he is comforted and you are in anguish .
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
" he said , ' I ask you therefore , father , that you would send him to my father 's house ;
" he said to him , ' If they don 't listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead . ' "
he said to the disciples , " It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come , but woe to him through whom they come !
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
the Lord said , " If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed , you would tell this sycamore tree , ' Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
even so you also , when you have done all the things that are commanded you , say , ' We are unworthy servants . we have done our duty . ' "
being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come , he answered them , " The Kingdom of God doesn 't come with observation ;
neither will they say , ' Look , here ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' for behold , the Kingdom of God is within you . "
they will tell you , ' Look , here ! ' or ' Look , there ! ' Don 't go away , nor follow after them ,
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he who will be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
saying , " There was a judge in a certain city who didn 't fear God , and didn 't respect man .
won 't God avenge his chosen ones , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
I tell you that he will avenge them quickly . nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
but the tax collector , standing far away , wouldn 't even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! '
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
when Jesus heard these things , he said to him , " You still lack one thing . sell all that you have , and distribute it to the poor . you will have treasure in heaven . come , follow me . "
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there is no one who has left house , or wife , or brothers , or parents , or children , for the Kingdom of God 's sake ,
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
he cried out , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
there was a man named Zacchaeus . he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and saw him , and said to him , " Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . "
when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
Jesus said to him , " Today , salvation has come to this house , because he also is a son of Abraham .
as they heard these things , he went on and told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately .
but his citizens hated him , and sent an envoy after him , saying , ' We don 't want this man to reign over us . '
" he said to him , ' Well done , you good servant ! because you were found faithful with very little , you shall have authority over ten cities . '
for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . you take up that which you didn 't lay down , and reap that which you didn 't sow . '
it happened , when he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany , at the mountain that is called Olivet , he sent two of his disciples ,
saying , " Go your way into the village on the other side , in which , as you enter , you will find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat . untie it , and bring it .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you untying it ? ' say to him : ' the Lord needs it . ' "
as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
saying , " Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! peace in heaven , and glory in the highest ! "
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn 't know the time of your visitation . "
he was teaching daily in the temple , but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him .
they asked him , " Tell us : by what authority do you do these things ? or who is giving you this authority ? "
he began to tell the people this parable . " a man planted a vineyard , and rented it out to some farmers , and went into another country for a long time .
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
they threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
show me a denarius . whose image and inscription are on it ? " they answered , " Caesar 's . "
they weren 't able to trap him in his words before the people . they marveled at his answer , and were silent .
for they can 't die any more , for they are like the angels , and are children of God , being children of the resurrection .
now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for all are alive to him . "
David himself says in the book of Psalms , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand ,
" beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the marketplaces , the best seats in the synagogues , and the best places at feasts ;
who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayers : these will receive greater condemnation . "
for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , put in all that she had to live on . "
they asked him , " Teacher , so when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are about to happen ? "
when you hear of wars and disturbances , don 't be terrified , for these things must happen first , but the end won 't come immediately . "
but before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you up to synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name 's sake .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days ! for there will be great distress in the land , and wrath to this people .
there will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars ; and on the earth anxiety of nations , in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves ;
but when these things begin to happen , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is near . "
" so be careful , or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing , drunkenness , and cares of this life , and that day will come on you suddenly .
the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death , for they feared the people .
he sent Peter and John , saying , " Go and prepare the Passover for us , that we may eat . "
for I tell you , I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine , until the Kingdom of God comes . "
likewise , he took the cup after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
the Son of Man indeed goes , as it has been determined , but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! "
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom . you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
for I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me : ' he was counted with transgressors . ' for that which concerns me has an end . "
they said , " Lord , behold , here are two swords . " he said to them , " That is enough . "
when he was at the place , he said to them , " Pray that you don 't enter into temptation . "
when he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
Jesus said to the chief priests , captains of the temple , and elders , who had come against him , " Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
when I was with you in the temple daily , you didn 't stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
a certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light , and looking intently at him , said , " This man also was with him . "
after a little while someone else saw him , and said , " You also are one of them ! " but Peter answered , " Man , I am not ! "
after about one hour passed , another confidently affirmed , saying , " Truly this man also was with him , for he is a Galilean ! "
but Peter said , " Man , I don 't know what you are talking about ! " immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
having blindfolded him , they struck him on the face and asked him , " Prophesy ! who is the one who struck you ? "
Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he answered him , " So you say . "
now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some miracle done by him .
he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus up to their will .
for if they do these things in the green tree , what will be done in the dry ? "
when they came to the place that is called The Skull , they crucified him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they don 't know what they are doing . " dividing his garments among them , they cast lots .
the people stood watching . the rulers with them also scoffed at him , saying , " He saved others . let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! "
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
one of the criminals who was hanged insulted him , saying , " If you are the Christ , save yourself and us ! "
Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , " Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! " having said this , he breathed his last .
when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , " Certainly this was a righteous man . "
all the multitudes that came together to see this , when they saw the things that were done , returned home beating their breasts .
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
the women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
but Peter got up and ran to the tomb . stooping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
he said to them , " What things ? " they said to him , " The things concerning Jesus , the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
they urged him , saying , " Stay with us , for it is almost evening , and the day is almost over . " he went in to stay with them .
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
but they were terrified and filled with fear , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
he said to them , " Thus it is written , and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day ,
behold , I send forth the promise of my Father on you . but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high . "
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
the same came as a witness , that he might testify about the light , that all might believe through him .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
this is John 's testimony , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , " Who are you ? "
the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said , " You are Simon the son of Jonah . you shall be called Cephas " ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) .
on the next day , he was determined to go out into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
Nathanael said to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
Nathanael answered him , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! you are King of Israel ! "
Jesus answered him , " Because I told you , ' I saw you underneath the fig tree , ' do you believe ? you will see greater things than these ! "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine , and didn 't know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom ,
and said to him , " Everyone serves the good wine first , and when the guests have drunk freely , then that which is worse . you have kept the good wine until now ! "
the Jews therefore said , " It took forty @-@ six years to build this temple ! will you raise it up in three days ? "
Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
no one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
after these things , Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea . he stayed there with them , and baptized .
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
one who believes in the Son has eternal life , but one who disobeys the Son won 't see life , but the wrath of God remains on him . "
so he came to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son , Joseph .
Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being tired from his journey , sat down by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
a woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink . "
the woman said to him , " Sir , you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . from where then have you that living water ?
are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his children , and his livestock ? "
the woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I don 't get thirsty , neither come all the way here to draw . "
Jesus said to her , " Woman , believe me , the hour comes , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , will you worship the Father .
but the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers .
so the woman left her water pot , and went away into the city , and said to the people ,
the disciples therefore said one to another , " Has anyone brought him something to eat ? "
he who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit to eternal life ; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
from that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman , who testified , " He told me everything that I did . "
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus therefore said to him , " Unless you see signs and wonders , you will in no way believe . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool , and stirred up the water . whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had .
when Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been sick for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to be made well ? "
immediately , the man was made well , and took up his mat and walked . now it was the Sabbath on that day .
afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , " Behold , you are made well . sin no more , so that nothing worse happens to you . "
but Jesus answered them , " My Father is still working , so I am working , too . "
for this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
for as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires .
that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . he who doesn 't honor the Son doesn 't honor the Father who sent him .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don 't seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
" you search the Scriptures , because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and these are they which testify about me .
" Don 't think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
Philip answered him , " Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that everyone of them may receive a little . "
" there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish , but what are these among so many ? "
Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " now there was much grass in that place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did , they said , " This is truly the prophet who comes into the world . "
Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had rowed about twenty @-@ five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat . immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
when they found him on the other side of the sea , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you come here ? "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , it wasn 't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
for the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . "
Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thirsty .
they said , " isn 't this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how then does he say , ' I have come down out of heaven ? ' "
this is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that anyone may eat of it and not die .
the Jews therefore contended with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
therefore many of his disciples , when they heard this , said , " This is a hard saying ! who can listen to it ? "
it is the spirit who gives life . the flesh profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
we have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
now he spoke of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , for it was he who would betray him , being one of the twelve .
his brothers therefore said to him , " Depart from here , and go into Judea , that your disciples also may see your works which you do .
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him . some said , " He is a good man . " others said , " Not so , but he leads the multitude astray . "
the Jews therefore marveled , saying , " How does this man know letters , having never been educated ? "
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
if a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
the Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
then Jesus said , " I will be with you a little while longer , then I go to him who sent me .
now on the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , " If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me and drink !
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , " Why didn 't you bring him ? "
now very early in the morning , he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him . he sat down , and taught them .
now in our law , Moses commanded us to stone such . what then do you say about her ? "
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
he said to them , " You are from beneath . I am from above . you are of this world . I am not of this world .
they said therefore to him , " Who are you ? " Jesus said to them , " Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning .
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
he who sent me is with me . the Father hasn 't left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . "
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
they answered him , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus said to them , " If you were Abraham 's children , you would do the works of Abraham .
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn 't do this .
you do the works of your father . " they said to him , " We were not born of sexual immorality . we have one Father , God . "
then the Jews said to him , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and you say , ' If a man keeps my word , he will never taste of death . '
are you greater than our father , Abraham , who died ? the prophets died . who do you make yourself out to be ? "
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( which means " Sent " ) . so he went away , washed , and came back seeing .
again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . he said to them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and I see . "
therefore they asked the blind man again , " What do you say about him , because he opened your eyes ? " he said , " He is a prophet . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
so they called the man who was blind a second time , and said to him , " Give glory to God . we know that this man is a sinner . "
they said to him again , " What did he do to you ? how did he open your eyes ? "
he answered them , " I told you already , and you didn 't listen . why do you want to hear it again ? you don 't also want to become his disciples , do you ? "
we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
Jesus said , " I came into this world for judgment , that those who don 't see may see ; and that those who see may become blind . "
the gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don 't know the voice of strangers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
he who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who doesn 't own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and flees . the wolf snatches the sheep , and scatters them .
the hired hand flees because he is a hired hand , and doesn 't care for the sheep .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
the Jews therefore came around him and said to him , " How long will you hold us in suspense ? if you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
but if I do them , though you don 't believe me , believe the works ; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . "
Jesus answered , " aren 't there twelve hours of daylight ? if a man walks in the day , he doesn 't stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
but if a man walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light isn 't in him . "
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe . nevertheless , let 's go to him . "
Martha said to him , " I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . "
Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . he who believes in me will still live , even if he dies .
she said to him , " Yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you are the Christ , God 's Son , he who comes into the world . "
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and said , " Where have you laid him ? " they told him , " Lord , come and see . "
some of them said , " couldn 't this man , who opened the eyes of him who was blind , have also kept this man from dying ? "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
the chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , " What are we doing ? for this man does many signs .
if we leave him alone like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . "
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . "
now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
then six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
so they made him a supper there . Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
for you always have the poor with you , but you don 't always have me . "
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
" Don 't be afraid , daughter of Zion . behold , your King comes , sitting on a donkey 's colt . "
his disciples didn 't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying about it .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
these , therefore , came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
" now my soul is troubled . what shall I say ? ' father , save me from this time ? ' but for this cause I came to this time .
the multitude therefore , who stood by and heard it , said that it had thundered . others said , " An angel has spoken to him . "
now is the judgment of this world . now the prince of this world will be cast out .
the multitude answered him , " We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever . how do you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ? ' who is this Son of Man ? "
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
" he has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart , lest they should see with their eyes , and perceive with their heart , and would turn , and I would heal them . "
nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they didn 't confess it , so that they wouldn 't be put out of the synagogue ,
I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness .
if anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn 't believe , I don 't judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and doesn 't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
I know that his commandment is eternal life . the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father has said to me , so I speak . "
now before the feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ,
arose from supper , and laid aside his outer garments . he took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
Peter said to him , " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " If I don 't wash you , you have no part with me . "
Jesus said to him , " Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed , but is completely clean . you are clean , but not all of you . "
for he knew him who would betray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
you call me , ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' you say so correctly , for so I am .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
most certainly I tell you , he who receives whomever I send , receives me ; and he who receives me , receives him who sent me . "
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , and said to him , " Tell us who it is of whom he speaks . "
after the piece of bread , then Satan entered into him . then Jesus said to him , " What you do , do quickly . "
for some thought , because Judas had the money box , that Jesus said to him , " Buy what things we need for the feast , " or that he should give something to the poor .
when he had gone out , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
a new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
Jesus answered him , " Will you lay down your life for me ? most certainly I tell you , the rooster won 't crow until you have denied me three times .
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it weren 't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
Jesus said to him , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . no one comes to the Father , except through me .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
Philip said to him , " Lord , show us the Father , and that will be enough for us . "
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
I will pray to the Father , and he will give you another Counselor , that he may be with you forever , --
the Spirit of truth , whom the world can 't receive ; for it doesn 't see him , neither knows him . you know him , for he lives with you , and will be in you .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
he who doesn 't love me doesn 't keep my words . the word which you hear isn 't mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
but the Counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and will remind you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don 't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father commanded me , even so I do . arise , let us go from here .
if a man doesn 't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
" in this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
" when the Counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn 't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
but now I am going to him who sent me , and none of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
most certainly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
until now , you have asked nothing in my name . ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don 't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
I have told you these things , that in me you may have peace . in the world you have oppression ; but cheer up ! I have overcome the world . "
Jesus said these things , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , " Father , the time has come . glorify your Son , that your Son may also glorify you ;
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . they were yours , and you have given them to me . they have kept your word .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
the glory which you have given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
I in them , and you in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may know that you sent me , and loved them , even as you loved me .
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron , where there was a garden , into which he and his disciples entered .
Judas then , having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , came there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
they answered him , " Jesus of Nazareth . " Jesus said to them , " I am he . " Judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
Jesus therefore said to Peter , " Put the sword into its sheath . the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not surely drink it ? "
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
Jesus answered him , " I spoke openly to the world . I always taught in synagogues , and in the temple , where the Jews always meet . I said nothing in secret .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
one of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " didn 't I see you in the garden with him ? "
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
Pilate therefore went out to them , and said , " What accusation do you bring against this man ? "
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium , called Jesus , and said to him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? "
but you have a custom , that I should release someone to you at the Passover . therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " Behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . Pilate said to them , " Behold , the man ! "
he entered into the Praetorium again , and said to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " but Jesus gave him no answer .
at this , Pilate was seeking to release him , but the Jews cried out , saying , " If you release this man , you aren 't Caesar 's friend ! everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar ! "
when Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
they cried out , " Away with him ! away with him ! crucify him ! " Pilate said to them , " Shall I crucify your King ? " the chief priests answered , " We have no king but Caesar ! "
Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " JESUS OF Nazareth , THE KING OF THE JEWS . "
therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
then he said to the disciple , " Behold , your mother ! " from that hour , the disciple took her to his own home .
after this , Jesus , seeing that all things were now finished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , " I am thirsty . "
now a vessel full of vinegar was set there ; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop , and held it at his mouth .
he who has seen has testified , and his testimony is true . he knows that he tells the truth , that you may believe .
now on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene went early , while it was still dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
Jesus therefore said to them again , " Peace be to you . as the Father has sent me , even so I send you . "
after eight days again his disciples were inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , the doors being locked , and stood in the midst , and said , " Peace be to you . "
then he said to Thomas , " Reach here your finger , and see my hands . reach here your hand , and put it into my side . Don 't be unbelieving , but believing . "
Simon Peter said to them , " I 'm going fishing . " they told him , " We are also coming with you . " they immediately went out , and entered into the boat . that night , they caught nothing .
Jesus therefore said to them , " Children , have you anything to eat ? " they answered him , " No . "
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @-@ three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn 't torn .
Jesus said to them , " Come and eat breakfast . " none of the disciples dared inquire of him , " Who are you ? " knowing that it was the Lord .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
now he said this , signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . when he had said this , he said to him , " Follow me . "
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn 't have room for the books that would be written .
until the day in which he was received up , after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen .
he said to them , " It isn 't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness , and falling headlong , his body burst open , and all his intestines gushed out .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
beginning from the baptism of John , to the day that he was received up from us , of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection . "
they prayed , and said , " You , Lord , who know the hearts of all men , show which one of these two you have chosen
to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away , that he might go to his own place . "
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
they were all amazed and marveled , saying to one another , " Behold , aren 't all these who speak Galileans ?
for these aren 't drunken , as you suppose , seeing it is only the third hour of the day .
'It will be in the last days , says God , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh . your sons and your daughters will prophesy . your young men will see visions . your old men will dream dreams .
yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
I will show wonders in the sky above , and signs on the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and billows of smoke .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
him , being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God , you have taken by the hand of lawless men , crucified and killed ;
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
because you will not leave my soul in Hades , neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay .
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
" let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you crucified . "
Peter said to them , " Repent , and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
day by day , continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread at home , they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart ,
praising God , and having favor with all the people . the Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved .
but Peter said , " Silver and gold have I none , but what I have , that I give you . in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up and walk ! "
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
but many of those who heard the word believed , and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
it happened in the morning , that their rulers , elders , and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem .
he is ' the stone which was regarded as worthless by you , the builders , which has become the head of the corner . '
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
but so that this spreads no further among the people , let 's threaten them , that from now on they don 't speak to anyone in this name . "
but Peter and John answered them , " Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves ,
when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for everyone glorified God for that which was done .
" for truly , in this city against your holy servant , Jesus , whom you anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , were gathered together
while you stretch out your hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus . "
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul . not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own , but they had all things in common .
and laid them at the apostles ' feet , and distribution was made to each , according as anyone had need .
but Peter said , " Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
she fell down immediately at his feet , and died . the young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her by her husband .
multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem , bringing sick people , and those who were tormented by unclean spirits : and they were all healed .
but an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night , and brought them out , and said ,
saying , " didn 't we strictly command you not to teach in this name ? behold , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and intend to bring this man 's blood on us . "
God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and remission of sins .
after this man , Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some people after him . he also perished , and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
but if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow it , and you would be found even to be fighting against God ! "
they agreed with him . summoning the apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus ' name .
now in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplying , a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily service .
the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said , " It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables .
therefore select from among you , brothers , seven men of good report , full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly . a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us . "
he said , " Brothers and fathers , listen . the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
God spoke in this way : that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem .
the same took advantage of our race , and mistreated our fathers , and forced them to throw out their babies , so that they wouldn 't stay alive .
but he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
Moses fled at this saying , and became a stranger in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
'i am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ' Moses trembled , and dared not look .
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
they made a calf in those days , and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their hands .
who found favor in the sight of God , and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob .
'heaven is my throne , and the earth a footstool for my feet . what kind of house will you build me ? ' says the Lord ; ' or what is the place of my rest ?
which of the prophets didn 't your fathers persecute ? they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One , of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers .
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
but there was a certain man , Simon by name , who used to practice sorcery in the city , and amazed the people of Samaria , making himself out to be some great one ,
but when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
who , when they had come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ;
now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ' hands , he offered them money ,
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans .
but an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " Arise , and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . this is a desert . "
in his humiliation , his judgment was taken away . who will declare His generation ? for his life is taken from the earth . "
he commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
but Philip was found at Azotus . passing through , he preached the Good News to all the cities , until he came to Caesarea .
but Saul , still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus , that if he found any who were of the Way , whether men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
as he traveled , it happened that he got close to Damascus , and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him .
he fell on the earth , and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? "
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias . the Lord said to him in a vision , " Ananias ! " he said , " Behold , it 's me , Lord . "
and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight . "
but the Lord said to him , " Go your way , for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings , and the children of Israel .
when Saul had come to Jerusalem , he tried to join himself to the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
when the brothers knew it , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him off to Tarsus .
so the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened , as Peter went throughout all those parts , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which when translated , means dorcas . this woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did .
at about the ninth hour of the day , he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him , and saying to him , " Cornelius ! "
he lodges with one Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the seaside . "
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon .
on the next day they entered into Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
when it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell down at his feet , and worshiped him .
Cornelius said , " Four days ago , I was fasting until this hour , and at the ninth hour , I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
the word which he sent to the children of Israel , preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--
you yourselves know what happened , which was proclaimed throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ;
even Jesus of Nazareth , how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power , who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
all the prophets testify about him , that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins . "
now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
but a voice answered me the second time out of heaven , ' What God has cleansed , don 't you call unclean . '
I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ' John indeed baptized in water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit . '
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
but there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they had come to Antioch , spoke to the Hellenists , preaching the Lord Jesus .
for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith , and many people were added to the Lord .
Peter therefore was kept in the prison , but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him .
the same night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . guards in front of the door kept the prison .
the angel said to him , " Get dressed and put on your sandals . " he did so . he said to him , " Put on your cloak , and follow me . "
and he went out and followed him . he didn 't know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter .
when Herod had sought for him , and didn 't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
as they served the Lord and fasted , the Holy Spirit said , " Separate Barnabas and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
so , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia . from there they sailed to Cyprus .
who was with the Proconsul , Sergius PAULUS , a man of understanding . this man summoned Barnabas and Saul , and sought to hear the word of God .
and said , " Full of all deceit and all cunning , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
but they , passing on from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , speak . "
Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , " Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen .
afterward they asked for a king , and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
brothers , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , the word of this salvation is sent out to you .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things , from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses .
'Behold , you scoffers , and wonder , and perish ; for I work a work in your days , a work which you will in no way believe , if one declares it to you . ' "
so when the Jews went out of the synagogue , the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
as the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of God . as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their borders .
it happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
therefore they stayed there a long time , speaking boldly in the Lord , who testified to the word of his grace , granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes .
yet he didn 't leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . "
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
when they had preached the Good News to that city , and had made many disciples , they returned to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch ,
confirming the souls of the disciples , exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
from there they sailed to Antioch , from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
they , being sent on their way by the assembly , passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles . they caused great joy to all the brothers .
God , who knows the heart , testified about them , giving them the Holy Spirit , just like he did to us .
now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
'After these things I will return . I will again build the tabernacle of David , which has fallen . I will again build its ruins . I will set it up ,
that the rest of men may seek after the Lord ; All the Gentiles who are called by my name , Says the Lord , who does all these things .
they wrote these things by their hand : " the apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : greetings .
we have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
for it seemed good to the Holy Spirit , and to us , to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things :
after they had spent some time there , they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles .
after some days Paul said to Barnabas , " Let 's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
he came to Derbe and Lystra : and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewess who believed ; but his father was a Greek .
when they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
when they had come opposite Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit didn 't allow them .
a vision appeared to Paul in the night . there was a man of Macedonia standing , begging him , and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira , one who worshiped God , heard us ; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul .
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
when they had brought them to the magistrates , they said , " These men , being Jews , are agitating our city ,
the multitude rose up together against them , and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them , and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
who , having received such a command , threw them into the inner prison , and secured their feet in the stocks .
but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them .
suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone 's bonds were loosened .
the jailer , being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
and they came and begged them . when they had brought them out , they asked them to depart from the city .
they went out of the prison , and entered into Lydia 's house . when they had seen the brothers , they encouraged them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
Paul , as was his custom , went in to them , and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , " This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . "
but those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens . receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly , they departed .
now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols .
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with those who met him .
they took hold of him , and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , " May we know what this new teaching is , which is spoken by you ?
Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus , and said , " You men of Athens , I perceive that you are very religious in all things .
the God who made the world and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , doesn 't dwell in temples made with hands ,
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwellings ,
'For in him we live , and move , and have our being . ' as some of your own poets have said , ' For we are also his offspring . '
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinthians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
but if they are questions about words and names and your own law , look to it yourselves . for I don 't want to be a judge of these matters . "
then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn 't care about any of these things .
Paul , having stayed after this many more days , took his leave of the brothers , and sailed from there for Syria , together with Priscilla and Aquila . he shaved his head in Cenchreae , for he had a vow .
he came to Ephesus , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of Galatia , and Phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
now a certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by race , an eloquent man , came to Ephesus . he was mighty in the Scriptures .
when he had determined to pass over into Achaia , the brothers encouraged him , and wrote to the disciples to receive him . when he had come , he greatly helped those who had believed through grace ;
it happened that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul , having passed through the upper country , came to Ephesus , and found certain disciples .
he said to them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " they said to him , " No , we haven 't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . "
this became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived at Ephesus . fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen ,
whom he gathered together , with the workmen of like occupation , and said , " Sirs , you know that by this business we have our wealth .
not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing , and her majesty destroyed , whom all Asia and the world worships . "
they brought Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . Alexander beckoned with his hand , and would have made a defense to the people .
but when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
when he had gone through those parts , and had encouraged them with many words , he came into Greece .
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for he had so arranged , intending himself to go by land .
for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
serving the Lord with all humility , with many tears , and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews ;
sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him to the ship .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
then Paul took the men , and the next day , purified himself and went with them into the temple , declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification , until the offering was offered for every one of them .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
for they had seen Trophimus , the Ephesian , with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
immediately he took soldiers and centurions , and ran down to them . they , when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
then the commanding officer came near , arrested him , commanded him to be bound with two chains , and inquired who he was and what he had done .
some shouted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he couldn 't find out the truth because of the noise , he commanded him to be brought into the barracks .
when he came to the stairs , it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ;
as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he asked the commanding officer , " May I speak to you ? " he said , " Do you know Greek ?
aren 't you then the Egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins ? "
as also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify , from whom also I received letters to the brothers , and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished .
I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '
I answered , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' he said to me , ' I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute . '
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn 't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when I couldn 't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus ,
came to me , and standing by me said to me , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ' in that very hour I looked up at him .
he said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
now why do you wait ? arise , be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on the name of the Lord . '
the commanding officer answered , " I bought my citizenship for a great price . " Paul said , " But I was born a Roman . "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
the following night , the Lord stood by him , and said , " Cheer up , Paul , for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem , so you must testify also at Rome . "
they came to the chief priests and the elders , and said , " We have bound ourselves under a great curse , to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
but Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul .
Paul summoned one of the centurions , and said , " Bring this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to tell him . "
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
the commanding officer took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
" I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive . " he commanded that he be kept in Herod 's palace .
after five days , the high priest , Ananias , came down with certain elders and an orator , one Tertullus . they informed the governor against Paul .
we accept it in all ways and in all places , most excellent Felix , with all thankfulness .
when the governor had beckoned to him to speak , Paul answered , " Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years , I cheerfully make my defense ,
having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
now after some years , I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation , and offerings ;
amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , not with a mob , nor with turmoil .
but Felix , having more exact knowledge concerning the Way , deferred them , saying , " When Lysias , the commanding officer , comes down , I will decide your case . "
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
but after some days , Felix came with Drusilla , his wife , who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and desiring to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul in bonds .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
but Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
but Paul said , " I am standing before Caesar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you also know very well .
then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , " You have appealed to Caesar . to Caesar you shall go . "
now when some days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea , and greeted Festus .
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , asking for a sentence against him .
Agrippa said to Festus , " I also would like to hear the man myself . " " tomorrow , " he said , " you shall hear him . "
of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord . therefore I have brought him forth before you , and especially before you , King Agrippa , that , after examination , I may have something to write .
for it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to also specify the charges against him . "
" indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
having known me from the first , if they are willing to testify , that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
" I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
at noon , O king , I saw on the way a light from the sky , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who traveled with me .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the goads . '
" I said , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' " he said , ' I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
to open their eyes , that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me . '
how the Christ must suffer , and how , by the resurrection of the dead , he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles . "
as he thus made his defense , Festus said with a loud voice , " Paul , you are crazy ! your great learning is driving you insane ! "
Agrippa said to Festus , " This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . "
when it was determined that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius , of the Augustan band .
and said to them , " Sirs , I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . "
when the ship was caught , and couldn 't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
running under the lee of a small island called Clauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat .
as we labored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw things overboard .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
for there stood by me this night an angel , belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve ,
therefore , sirs , cheer up ! for I believe God , that it will be just as it has been spoken to me .
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , " Unless these stay in the ship , you can 't be saved . "
while the day was coming on , Paul begged them all to take some food , saying , " This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting , having taken nothing .
but the centurion , desiring to save Paul , stopped them from their purpose , and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land ;
and the rest should follow , some on planks , and some on other things from the ship . so it happened that they all escaped safely to the land .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
from there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium . after one day , a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli ,
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
for this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you . for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
when they didn 't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
who was declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the Spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
through whom we received grace and apostleship , for obedience of faith among all the nations , for his name 's sake ;
to all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
who exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
likewise also the men , leaving the natural function of the woman , burned in their lust toward one another , men doing what is inappropriate with men , and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
or do you despise the riches of his goodness , forbearance , and patience , not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @-@ seeking , and don 't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
but now apart from the law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified by the law and the prophets ;
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe . for there is no distinction ,
or is God the God of Jews only ? isn 't he the God of Gentiles also ? yes , of Gentiles also ,
for if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not toward God .
for what does the Scripture say ? " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness . "
is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised , or on the uncircumcised also ? for we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness .
how then was it counted ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn 't through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope doesn 't disappoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
so then as through one trespass , all men were condemned ; even so through one act of righteousness , all men were justified to life .
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will also be part of his resurrection ;
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bondservants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
but sin , finding occasion through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of coveting . for apart from the law , sin is dead .
for I don 't know what I am doing . for I don 't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
for the good which I desire , I don 't do ; but the evil which I don 't desire , that I practice .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
but I see a different law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
I thank God through Jesus Christ , our Lord ! so then with the mind , I myself serve God 's law , but with the flesh , the sin 's law .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for what the law couldn 't do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ ; if indeed we suffer with him , that we may also be glorified with him .
for the creation was subjected to vanity , not of its own will , but because of him who subjected it , in hope
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
he who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit 's mind , because he makes intercession for the saints according to God .
we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
for whom he foreknew , he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .
what then shall we say about these things ? if God is for us , who can be against us ?
he who didn 't spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how would he not also with him freely give us all things ?
nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I tell the truth in Christ . I am not lying , my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit ,
for I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers ' sake , my relatives according to the flesh ,
of whom are the fathers , and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh , who is over all , God , blessed forever . Amen .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
neither , because they are Abraham 's seed , are they all children . but , " In Isaac will your seed be called . "
for this is a word of promise , " At the appointed time I will come , and Sarah will have a son . "
but indeed , O man , who are you to reply against God ? will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Why did you make me like this ? "
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
Isaiah cries concerning Israel , " If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , it is the remnant who will be saved ;
why ? because they didn 't seek it by faith , but as it were by works of the law . they stumbled over the stumbling stone ;
for being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they didn 't subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
but they didn 't all listen to the glad news . for Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our report ? "
but I say , didn 't they hear ? yes , most certainly , " Their sound went out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world . "
but as to Israel he says , " All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . "
I ask then , did God reject his people ? may it never be ! for I also am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
but how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Baal . "
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he didn 't obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
I ask then , did they stumble that they might fall ? may it never be ! but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles , to provoke them to jealousy .
for if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world , what would their acceptance be , but life from the dead ?
true ; by their unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by your faith . Don 't be conceited , but fear ;
see then the goodness and severity of God . toward those who fell , severity ; but toward you , goodness , if you continue in his goodness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
they also , if they don 't continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
even so these also have now been disobedient , that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy .
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
Don 't be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @-@ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
Don 't seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " Vengeance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those who exist are ordained by God .
therefore you need to be in subjection , not only because of the wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
for this reason you also pay taxes , for they are servants of God 's service , attending continually on this very thing .
do this , knowing the time , that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep , for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed .
let us walk properly , as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts , and not in strife and jealousy .
who are you who judge another 's servant ? to his own lord he stands or falls . yes , he will be made to stand , for God has power to make him stand .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you despise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . every tongue will confess to God . ' "
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
for even Christ didn 't please himself . but , as it is written , " The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . "
now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God , that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers ,
now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
for I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me , for the obedience of the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
when therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
now I mean this , that each one of you says , " I follow Paul , " " I follow Apollos , " " I follow Cephas , " and , " I follow Christ . "
for Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ wouldn 't be made void .
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the lawyer of this world ? hasn 't God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
when I came to you , brothers , I didn 't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
but we speak God 's wisdom in a mystery , the wisdom that has been hidden , which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory ,
which none of the rulers of this world has known . for had they known it , they wouldn 't have crucified the Lord of glory .
which things also we speak , not in words which man 's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
" for who has known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? " but we have Christ 's mind .
let no one deceive himself . if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . for it is written , " He has taken the wise in their craftiness . "
so let a man think of us as Christ 's servants , and stewards of God 's mysteries .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
for , I think that God has displayed us , the apostles , last of all , like men sentenced to death . for we are made a spectacle to the world , both to angels and men .
being defamed , we entreat . we are made as the filth of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now .
for though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ , yet not many fathers . for in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the Good News .
for I most certainly , as being absent in body but present in spirit , have already , as though I were present , judged him who has done this thing .
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . for indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
I say this to move you to shame . isn 't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers ?
or don 't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Don 't be deceived . neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosexuals ,
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? may it never be !
flee sexual immorality ! " every sin that a man does is outside the body , " but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
but , because of sexual immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband . otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemblies .
were you called being a bondservant ? Don 't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
now concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy .
are you bound to a wife ? Don 't seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don 't seek a wife .
but if you marry , you have not sinned . if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . yet such will have oppression in the flesh , and I want to spare you .
but I say this , brothers : the time is short , that from now on , both those who have wives may be as though they had none ;
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord .
therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
for though there are things that are called " gods , " whether in the heavens or on earth ; as there are many " gods " and many " lords " ;
however , that knowledge isn 't in all men . but some , with consciousness of the idol until now , eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
but be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak .
and through your knowledge , he who is weak perishes , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
if to others I am not an apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? or doesn 't the law also say the same thing ?
but I have used none of these things , and I don 't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
for if I preach the Good News , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but woe is to me , if I don 't preach the Good News .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
for though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more .
to those who are without law , as without law ( not being without law toward God , but under law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
Don 't you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? run like that , that you may win .
neither be idolaters , as some of them were . as it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . "
but if one of those who don 't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
conscience , I say , not your own , but the other 's conscience . for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
but if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given to her for a covering .
but in giving you this command , I don 't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for there also must be factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you .
when he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body , which is broken for you . do this in memory of me . "
in the same way he also took the cup , after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord 's cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God 's Spirit says , " Jesus is accursed . " no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " but by the Holy Spirit .
to another faith , by the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healings , by the same Spirit ;
for in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bond or free ; and were all given to drink into one Spirit .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
but now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired .
that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
if I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don 't have love , I have become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal .
if I dole out all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don 't have love , it profits me nothing .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they didn 't give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is piped or harped ?
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
otherwise if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the " Amen " at your giving of thanks , seeing he doesn 't know what you say ?
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
but if all prophesy , and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in , he is reproved by all , and he is judged by all .
and thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed .
if any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret .
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
then the end comes , when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
for , " He put all things in subjection under his feet . " but when he says , " All things are put in subjection , " it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him .
or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? if the dead aren 't raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ?
if I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes , what does it profit me ? if the dead are not raised , then " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . "
that which you sow , you don 't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
it is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
the first man is of the earth , made of dust . the second man is the Lord from heaven .
therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the Lord 's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
but with you it may be that I will stay , or even winter , that you may send me on my journey wherever I go .
therefore let no one despise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
now I beg you , brothers ( you know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have set themselves to serve the saints ) ,
the assemblies of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ;
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
our hope for you is steadfast , knowing that , since you are partakers of the sufferings , so also are you of the comfort .
who delivered us out of so great a death , and does deliver ; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us ;
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
and by you to pass into Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea .
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " Amen , " to the glory of God through us .
who also sealed us , and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
now thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
to the one a stench from death to death ; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life . who is sufficient for these things ?
who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit . for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
but we all , with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord , the Spirit .
but we have this treasure in clay vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
for we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh .
but having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , " I believed , and therefore I spoke . " we also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
for we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in the heavens .
therefore also we make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be well pleasing to him .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are revealed to God ; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their sakes died and rose again .
therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on . even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
but all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their trespasses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
for him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf ; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
therefore " ' Come out from among them , and be separate , ' says the Lord . ' touch no unclean thing . I will receive you .
I will be to you a Father . you will be to me sons and daughters , ' says the Lord Almighty . "
great is my boldness of speech toward you . great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
and not by his coming only , but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you , while he told us of your longing , your mourning , and your zeal for me ; so that I rejoiced still more .
for though I made you sorry with my letter , I do not regret it , though I did regret it . for I see that my letter made you sorry , though just for a while .
I now rejoice , not that you were made sorry , but that you were made sorry to repentance . for you were made sorry in a godly way , that you might suffer loss by us in nothing .
for godly sorrow works repentance to salvation , which brings no regret . but the sorrow of the world works death .
therefore we have been comforted . in our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies .
therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies , and of our boasting on your behalf .
so that I won 't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident boasting .
let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ; not grudgingly , or under compulsion ; for God loves a cheerful giver .
now I Paul , myself , entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ ; I who in your presence am lowly among you , but being absent am bold toward you .
yes , I beg you that I may not , when present , show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some , who consider us to be walking according to the flesh .
for though we walk in the flesh , we don 't wage war according to the flesh ;
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds ,
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
not boasting beyond proper limits in other men 's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
for I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy . for I married you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
are they Hebrews ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
are they servants of Christ ? ( I speak as one beside himself ) I am more so ; in labors more abundantly , in prisons more abundantly , in stripes above measure , in deaths often .
three times I was beaten with rods . once I was stoned . three times I suffered shipwreck . I have been a night and a day in the deep .
besides those things that are outside , there is that which presses on me daily , anxiety for all the assemblies .
I know such a man ( whether in the body , or outside of the body , I don 't know ; God knows ) ,
how he was caught up into Paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in injuries , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ 's sake . for when I am weak , then am I strong .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
I exhorted Titus , and I sent the brother with him . did Titus take any advantage of you ? didn 't we walk in the same spirit ? didn 't we walk in the same steps ?
that again when I come my God would humble me before you , and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now , and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed .
this is the third time I am coming to you . " at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . "
for this cause I write these things while absent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for tearing down .
finally , brothers , rejoice . be perfected , be comforted , be of the same mind , live in peace , and the God of love and peace will be with you .
Paul , an apostle ( not from men , neither through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ) ,
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be cursed .
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia . then I returned to Damascus .
now about the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I 'm not lying .
( for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles ) ;
for before some people came from James , he ate with the Gentiles . but when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circumcision .
and the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy ; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
I just want to learn this from you . did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us . for it is written , " Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree , "
now I say this . a covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ , the law , which came four hundred thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise ; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise .
what then is the law ? it was added because of transgressions , until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made . it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
but the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
so we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world .
that which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you didn 't despise nor reject ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
they zealously seek you in no good way . no , they desire to alienate you , that you may seek them .
tell me , you that desire to be under the law , don 't you listen to the law ?
however , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now , for she is in bondage with her children .
but I , brothers , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don 't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
for the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary to one another , that you may not do the things that you desire .
now the works of the flesh are obvious , which are : adultery , sexual immorality , uncleanness , lustfulness ,
envyings , murders , drunkenness , orgies , and things like these ; of which I forewarn you , even as I also forewarned you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; looking to yourself so that you also aren 't tempted .
Don 't be deceived . God is not mocked , for whatever a man sows , that he will also reap .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don 't give up .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ;
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love ;
in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
who is a pledge of our inheritance , to the redemption of God 's own possession , to the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
having the eyes of your hearts enlightened , that you may know what is the hope of his calling , and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
he put all things in subjection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly ,
in which you once walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience ;
among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh , doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , even as the rest .
even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved ) ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
having abolished in the flesh the hostility , the law of commandments contained in ordinances , that he might create in himself one new man of the two , making peace ;
by which , when you read , you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ ;
that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News ,
and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God , who created all things through Jesus Christ ;
there is one body , and one Spirit , even as you also were called in one hope of your calling ;
he who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
he gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , shepherds and teachers ;
and put on the new man , who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet @-@ smelling fragrance .
know this for sure , that no sexually immoral person , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God .
speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the savior of the body .
even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . he who loves his own wife loves himself .
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
with all prayer and requests , praying at all times in the Spirit , and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints :
on my behalf , that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News ,
for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ .
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News .
what does it matter ? only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed . I rejoice in this , yes , and will rejoice .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
make my joy full , by being like @-@ minded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind ;
therefore God also highly exalted him , and gave to him the name which is above every name ;
for it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
that you may become blameless and harmless , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you are seen as lights in the world ,
yes , and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice with you all .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not tiresome , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circumcision , who worship God in the Spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ;
though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . if any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; concerning the law , a Pharisee ;
and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own , that which is of the law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is from God by faith ;
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming conformed to his death ;
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
I know how to be humbled , and I know also how to abound . in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in need .
you yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
we give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints ,
even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf ,
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don 't cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
that you may walk worthily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations . but now it has been revealed to his saints ,
to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory ;
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
be careful that you don 't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ .
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
and not holding firmly to the Head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments , grows with God 's growth .
put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual immorality , uncleanness , depraved passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
but now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and shameful speaking out of your mouth .
and have put on the new man , who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator ,
put on therefore , as God 's chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , humility , and perseverance ;
bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also do .
servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God .
let your speech always be with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one .
together with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they will make known to you everything that is going on here .
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , salutes you , always striving for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
tell Archippus , " Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . "
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father .
you became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
but having suffered before and been shamefully treated , as you know , at Philippi , we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
for you , brothers , became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus ; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen , even as they did from the Jews ;
who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets , and drove us out , and didn 't please God , and are contrary to all men ;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
finally then , brothers , we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God , that you abound more and more .
that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
therefore he who rejects this doesn 't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
but concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . but we exhort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
but we don 't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don 't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
see that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , for one another , and for all .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure .
and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire ,
giving vengeance to those who don 't know God , and to those who don 't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus ,
who will pay the penalty : eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might ,
when he comes to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired among all those who have believed ( because our testimony to you was believed ) in that day .
to this end we also pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of your calling , and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith , with power ;
now , brothers , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and our gathering together to him , we ask you
let no one deceive you in any way . for it will not be , unless the departure comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of destruction ,
he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped ; so that he sits as God in the temple of God , setting himself up as God .
now you know what is restraining him , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
that they all might be judged who didn 't believe the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
to which he called you through our Good News , for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified , even as also with you ;
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
for we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion , who don 't work at all , but are busybodies .
now those who are that way , we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the Lord be with you all .
as I urged you when I was going into Macedonia , stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
but the goal of this command is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith ;
the saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
however , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first , Jesus Christ might display all his patience , for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life .
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
but I don 't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
but she will be saved through her childbearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety .
moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside , to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil .
but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God 's house , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
without controversy , the mystery of godliness is great : God was revealed in the flesh , justified in the spirit , seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , and received up in glory .
but the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons ,
for every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with thanksgiving .
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
but if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old , having been the wife of one man ,
if any man or woman who believes has widows , let them relieve them , and don 't let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed .
let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
I command you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the chosen angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
in the same way also there are good works that are obvious , and those that are otherwise can 't be hidden .
let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed .
constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth , who suppose that godliness is a means of gain . withdraw yourself from such .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
fight the good fight of faith . lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called , and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who richly provides us with everything to enjoy ;
I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for God didn 't give us a spirit of fear , but of power , love , and self @-@ control .
therefore don 't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God ,
who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal ,
this you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord 's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at Ephesus , you know very well .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
also , if anyone competes in athletics , he isn 't crowned unless he has competed by the rules .
therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones ' sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
if anyone therefore purges himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , and suitable for the master 's use , prepared for every good work .
flee from youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
for some of these are people who creep into houses , and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts ,
even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , who concerning the faith , are rejected .
from infancy , you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith , which is in Christ Jesus .
for the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having itching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
Alexander , the coppersmith , did much evil to me . the Lord will repay him according to his works ,
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
if anyone is blameless , the husband of one wife , having children who believe , who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior .
for the overseer must be blameless , as God 's steward ; not self @-@ pleasing , not easily angered , not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain ;
but given to hospitality , a lover of good , sober minded , fair , holy , self @-@ controlled ;
whose mouths must be stopped ; men who overthrow whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for dishonest gain 's sake .
one of them , a prophet of their own , said , " Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , and idle gluttons . "
and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior , not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine , teachers of that which is good ;
to be sober minded , chaste , workers at home , kind , being in subjection to their own husbands , that God 's word may not be blasphemed .
instructing us to the intent that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we would live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present world ;
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ ;
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify for himself a people for his own possession , zealous for good works .
that , being justified by his grace , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
when I send Artemas to you , or Tychicus , be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis , for I have determined to winter there .
I beg you for my child , whom I have become the father of in my chains , Onesimus ,
but I was willing to do nothing without your consent , that your goodness would not be as of necessity , but of free will .
no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much rather to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
again , when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says , " Let all the angels of God worship him . "
of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows . "
and , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the works of your hands .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation--which at the first having been spoken through the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard ;
for he didn 't subject the world to come , of which we speak , to angels .
but one has somewhere testified , saying , " What is man , that you think of him ? or the son of man , that you care for him ?
but we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels , Jesus , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
again , " I will put my trust in him . " again , " Behold , here I am with the children whom God has given me . "
Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ,
therefore I was displeased with that generation , and said , ' They always err in their heart , but they didn 't know my ways ; '
but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called " today " ; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
for we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end :
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
for we don 't have a high priest who can 't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
for every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
so also Christ didn 't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
for although by this time you should be teachers , you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God . you have come to need milk , and not solid food .
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ , let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works , of faith toward God ,
of the teaching of baptisms , of laying on of hands , of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
but if it bears thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near being cursed , whose end is to be burned .
this hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
for this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best spoils .
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises .
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them .
for the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness , but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
the Holy Spirit is indicating this , that the way into the Holy Place wasn 't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
for Christ hasn 't entered into holy places made with hands , which are representations of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ;
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ,
or else wouldn 't they have ceased to be offered , because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ?
therefore when he comes into the world , he says , " Sacrifice and offering you didn 't desire , but you prepared a body for me ;
then I said , ' Behold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . ' "
let 's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water ,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries .
for we know him who said , " Vengeance belongs to me , " says the Lord , " I will repay . " again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
but remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ;
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
they were stoned . they were sawn apart . they were tempted . they were slain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill @-@ treated
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don 't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don 't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us , and we paid them respect . shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
all chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby .
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ;
for you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears .
for you have not come to a mountain that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and to blackness , darkness , storm ,
the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them ,
but you have come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to innumerable multitudes of angels ,
to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , to God the Judge of all , to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel .
whose voice shook the earth then , but now he has promised , saying , " Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . "
therefore , receiving a Kingdom that can 't be shaken , let us have grace , through which we serve God acceptably , with reverence and awe ,
Don 't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
so that with good courage we say , " The Lord is my helper . I will not fear . what can man do to me ? "
we have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
but let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
and the rich , in that he is made humble , because like the flower in the grass , he will pass away .
blessed is the man who endures temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
therefore , putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with humility the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a hearer who forgets , but a doer of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does .
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
for he who said , " Do not commit adultery , " also said , " Do not commit murder . " now if you do not commit adultery , but murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
and one of you tells them , " Go in peace , be warmed and filled " ; and yet you didn 't give them the things the body needs , what good is it ?
and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness " ; and he was called the friend of God .
for in many things we all stumble . if anyone doesn 't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet guided by a very small rudder , wherever the pilot desires .
so the tongue is also a little member , and boasts great things . see how a small fire can spread to a large forest !
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom .
you adulterers and adulteresses , don 't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
but he gives more grace . therefore it says , " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
be subject therefore to God . but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
whereas you don 't know what your life will be like tomorrow . for what is your life ? for you are a vapor , that appears for a little time , and then vanishes away .
your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
you also be patient . establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
behold , we call them blessed who endured . you have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the Lord in the outcome , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
confess your offenses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . the insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective .
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn 't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood : grace to you and peace be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he predicted the sufferings of Christ , and the glories that would follow them .
knowing that you were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers ,
seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection , love one another from the heart fervently :
having been born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of God , which lives and remains forever .
for , " All flesh is like grass , and all of man 's glory like the flower in the grass . the grass withers , and its flower falls ;
but the Lord 's word endures forever . " this is the word of Good News which was preached to you .
you also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
having good behavior among the nations , so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they see , glorify God in the day of visitation .
servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the wicked .
for what glory is it if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? but if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is commendable with God .
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
for this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God also adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you now are , if you do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit .
but even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you are blessed . " Don 't fear what they fear , neither be troubled . "
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for it is better , if it is God 's will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil .
because Christ also suffered for sins once , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring you to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ;
who before were disobedient , when God waited patiently in the days of Noah , while the ship was being built . in it , few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water .
who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him .
forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
as each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms .
but because you are partakers of Christ 's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy .
if you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men 's matters .
therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him , as to a faithful Creator .
neither as lording it over those entrusted to you , but making yourselves examples to the flock .
be sober and self @-@ controlled . be watchful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
she who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark , my son .
greet one another with a kiss of love . peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
yes , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply moral excellence ; and in moral excellence , knowledge ;
therefore , brothers , be more diligent to make your calling and election sure . for if you do these things , you will never stumble .
for thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
yes , I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure .
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for he received from God the Father honor and glory , when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
many will follow their immoral ways , and as a result , the way of the truth will be maligned .
in covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words : whose sentence now from of old doesn 't linger , and their destruction will not slumber .
for if God didn 't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and didn 't spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven others , a preacher of righteousness , when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement , and despise authority . daring , self @-@ willed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries ;
but these , as unreasoning creatures , born natural animals to be taken and destroyed , speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant , will in their destroying surely be destroyed ,
having eyes full of adultery , and who can 't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing ;
but he was rebuked for his own disobedience . a mute donkey spoke with a man 's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet .
these are wells without water , clouds driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
for , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the apostles of the Lord and Savior :
and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? for , from the day that the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation . "
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this , what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness ,
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
brothers , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning .
I write to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
whoever denies the Son , the same doesn 't have the Father . he who confesses the Son has the Father also .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world doesn 't know us , because it didn 't know him .
he who sins is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . to this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
beloved , don 't believe every spirit , but test the spirits , whether they are of God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
we are of God . he who knows God listens to us . he who is not of God doesn 't listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has punishment . he who fears is not made perfect in love .
we know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
for the truth 's sake , which remains in us , and it will be with us forever :
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
now I beg you , dear lady , not as though I wrote to you a new commandment , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
for many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who don 't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . this is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
whoever transgresses and doesn 't remain in the teaching of Christ , doesn 't have God . he who remains in the teaching , the same has both the Father and the Son .
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
beloved , don 't imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . he who does good is of God . he who does evil hasn 't seen God .
Demetrius has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
angels who didn 't keep their first domain , but deserted their own dwelling place , he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
but Michael , the archangel , when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation , but said , " May the Lord rebuke you ! "
but these speak evil of whatever things they don 't know . what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , they are destroyed in these things .
woe to them ! for they went in the way of Cain , and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire , and perished in Korah 's rebellion .
wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
to execute judgment on all , and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way , and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "
they said to you that " In the last time there will be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts . "
this is the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
John , to the seven assemblies that are in Asia : grace to you and peace , from God , who is and who was and who is to come ; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne ;
and he made us to be a Kingdom , priests to his God and Father ; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , " who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . "
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trumpet
saying , " What you see , write in a book and send to the seven assemblies : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and to Laodicea . "
his feet were like burnished brass , as if it had been refined in a furnace . his voice was like the voice of many waters .
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen hereafter ;
" to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . he who overcomes won 't be harmed by the second death .
repent therefore , or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
behold , I will throw her into a bed , and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression , unless they repent of her works .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and didn 't deny my name .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
behold , I stand at the door and knock . if anyone hears my voice and opens the door , then I will come in to him , and will dine with him , and he with me .
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
out of the throne proceed lightnings , sounds , and thunders . there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
when the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to him who sits on the throne , to him who lives forever and ever ,
the twenty @-@ four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever , and throw their crowns before the throne , saying ,
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book , and to break its seals ? "
one of the elders said to me , " Don 't weep . behold , the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has overcome ; he who opens the book and its seven seals . "
saying with a loud voice , " Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power , wealth , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and blessing ! "
I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , as with a voice of thunder , " Come and see ! "
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenix of barley for a denarius ! Don 't damage the oil and the wine ! "
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " How long , Master , the holy and true , until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? "
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshiped God ,
one of the elders answered , saying to me , " These who are arrayed in white robes , who are they , and from where did they come ? "
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the Lamb 's blood .
for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
the angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
they were given power not to kill them , but to torment them for five months . their torment was like the torment of a scorpion , when it strikes a person .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky , clothed with a cloud . a rainbow was on his head . his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
a reed like a rod was given to me . someone said , " Rise , and measure God 's temple , and the altar , and those who worship in it .
these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands , standing before the Lord of the earth .
their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
saying : " we give you thanks , Lord God , the Almighty , the one who is and who was ; because you have taken your great power , and reigned .
God 's temple that is in heaven was opened , and the ark of the Lord 's covenant was seen in his temple . Lightnings , sounds , thunders , an earthquake , and great hail followed .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him . authority to make war for forty @-@ two months was given to him .
he performs great signs , even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
they sing a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , those who had been redeemed out of the earth .
another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a great voice , " If anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives a mark on his forehead , or on his hand ,
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
the angel thrust his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vintage of the earth , and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
who wouldn 't fear you , Lord , and glorify your name ? for you only are holy . for all the nations will come and worship before you . for your righteous acts have been revealed . "
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . they deserve this . "
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scorch men with fire .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness . I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet @-@ colored animal , full of blasphemous names , having seven heads and ten horns .
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
after these things , I saw another angel coming down out of the sky , having great authority . the earth was illuminated with his glory .
I heard another voice from heaven , saying , " Come out of her , my people , that you have no participation in her sins , and that you don 't receive of her plagues ,
therefore in one day her plagues will come : death , mourning , and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire ; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
standing far away for the fear of her torment , saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for your judgment has come in one hour . '
the fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , she who was dressed in fine linen , purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls !
for in an hour such great riches are made desolate . ' every shipmaster , and everyone who sails anywhere , and mariners , and as many as gain their living by sea , stood far away ,
and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning , saying , ' What is like the great city ? '
" rejoice over her , O heaven , you saints , apostles , and prophets ; for God has judged your judgment on her . "
the twenty @-@ four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Give praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty thunders , saying , " Hallelujah ! for the Lord our God , the Almighty , reigns !
I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True . in righteousness he judges and makes war .
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF Lords . "
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away , and the sea is no more .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he who sits on the throne said , " Behold , I am making all things new . " he said , " Write , for these words of God are faithful and true . "
but for the cowardly , unbelieving , sinners , abominable , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
the city lies foursquare , and its length is as great as its breadth . he measured the city with the reed , Twelve thousand twelve stadia . its length , breadth , and height are equal .
its wall is one hundred forty @-@ four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the twelve gates were twelve pearls . each one of the gates was made of one pearl . the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
there will in no way enter into it anything profane , or one who causes an abomination or a lie , but only those who are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
he said to me , " These words are faithful and true . the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon . "
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the Bright and Morning Star . "
he who testifies these things says , " Yes , I come quickly . " Amen ! yes , come , Lord Jesus .
and God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and God called the dry land Earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens ,
and the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the LORD God said , It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help meet for him .
and the rib , which the LORD God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . and he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
and the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? and the woman said , The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat .
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
and she again bare his brother Abel . and Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
and Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering :
and Cain talked with Abel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him .
and Lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
and his brother 's name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and Zillah , she also bare tubal @-@ Cain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of tubal @-@ Cain was Naamah .
and Lamech said unto his wives , Adah and Zillah , Hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : for I have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name Seth :
and the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
and it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
and they went in unto Noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the LORD shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
and he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
and Noah builded an altar unto the LORD ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .
I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , This is the token of the covenant , which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of Noah , that went forth of the ark , were Shem , and Ham , and Japheth : and Ham is the father of Canaan .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
the sons of Japheth ; Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
out of that land went forth Asshur , and builded Nineveh , and the city Rehoboth , and Calah ,
and unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother 's name was Joktan .
and the LORD said , Behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
and I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
so Abram departed , as the LORD had spoken unto him ; and Lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
and Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . and the Canaanite was then in the land .
and the LORD appeared unto Abram , and said , Unto thy seed will I give this land : and there builded he an altar unto the LORD , who appeared unto him .
say , I pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with me for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it came to pass , that , when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
the princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh : and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
and he entreated Abram well for her sake : and he had sheep , and oxen , and he asses , and menservants , and maidservants , and she asses , and camels .
and Pharaoh called Abram , and said , What is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and Hai ;
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdmen of Lot 's cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and Abram said unto Lot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , and between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; for we be brethren .
and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for I will give it unto thee .
and in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzims in Ham , and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim ,
and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and they took Lot , Abram 's brother 's son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and the king of Sodom said unto Abram , Give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
after these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision , saying , Fear not , Abram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
and Abram said , Lord GOD , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ?
and Abram said , Behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the LORD came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
and he said unto him , I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full .
in the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates :
and he went in unto Hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
and he said , Hagar , Sarai 's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ? and she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
and the angel of the LORD said unto her , Behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction .
and he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
and when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and God said , Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
and said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .
and Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he hasted to dress it .
now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
is any thing too hard for the LORD ? at the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son .
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
and the LORD said , If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sakes .
and Abraham answered and said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , which am but dust and ashes :
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? and he said , If I find there forty and five , I will not destroy it .
and he spake unto him yet again , and said , Peradventure there shall be forty found there . and he said , I will not do it for forty 's sake .
and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Peradventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and the LORD went his way , as soon as he had left communing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
and there came two angels to Sodom at even ; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
and when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
and he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt .
and the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
and the firstborn bare a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Benammi : the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
and Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will slay me for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
for Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
and she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children suck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water , which Abimelech 's servants had violently taken away .
and he said , For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that I have digged this well .
and Abraham said unto his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you ,
and Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I.
and he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
so Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer @-@ sheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beer @-@ sheba .
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you : give me a possession of a buryingplace with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
nay , my lord , hear me : the field give I thee , and the cave that is therein , I give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury thy dead .
my lord , hearken unto me : the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver ; what is that betwixt me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth .
and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and he said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master Abraham .
and she said , Drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and said , Whose daughter art thou ? tell me , I pray thee : is there room in thy father 's house for us to lodge in ?
and Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
and he said , Come in , thou blessed of the LORD ; wherefore standest thou without ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
and the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine errand . and he said , Speak on .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
and Sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
and my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my father 's house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be thy master 's son 's wife , as the LORD hath spoken .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and her brother and her mother said , Let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and they called Rebekah , and said unto her , Wilt thou go with this man ? and she said , I will go .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a Vail , and covered herself .
and Jokshan begat Sheba , and Dedan . and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim .
then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai @-@ ROI .
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
and they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur , that is before Egypt , as thou goest toward Assyria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan @-@ aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Esau 's heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .
and the boys grew : and Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
and Esau said to Jacob , Feed me , I pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for I am faint : therefore was his name called Edom .
and Jacob said , swear to me this day ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto Jacob .
then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Esau despised his birthright .
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar .
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
and Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac 's herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him .
and he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there : and there Isaac 's servants digged a well .
that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and he said , Behold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
and make me savoury meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
and Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son . and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
my father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and Jacob said unto his father , I am Esau thy firstborn ; I have done according as thou badest me : arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
and Isaac said unto Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Esau or not .
and he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
and Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
arise , go to Padan @-@ aram , to the house of Bethuel thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother 's brother .
and give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
and Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Padan @-@ aram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother .
then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
and Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
and he called the name of that place Bethel : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
and Laban said , It is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
and Rachel said , God hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name Dan .
and Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . then Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son 's mandrakes .
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
and Jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chesnut tree ; and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and the man increased exceedingly , and had much cattle , and maidservants , and menservants , and camels , and asses .
and he heard the words of Laban 's sons , saying , Jacob hath taken away all that was our father 's ; and of that which was our father 's hath he gotten all this glory .
and the LORD said unto Jacob , Return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and I will be with thee .
I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
for all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
and God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
and Laban said to Jacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away unawares to me , and carried away my daughters , as captives taken with the sword ?
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
and Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
this twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
and Jacob said unto his brethren , Gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
and said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and thou saidst , I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which CANNOT be numbered for multitude .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
then thou shalt say , They be thy servant Jacob 's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
and Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and he said , Let me go , for the day breaketh . and he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and he said unto him , My lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me : and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
and Esau said , Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me . and he said , What needeth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
and Dinah the daughter of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
ask me never so much dowry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
and they said unto them , We CANNOT do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us :
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went out .
the sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
but Deborah Rebekah 's nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called Allon @-@ bachuth .
and God appeared unto Jacob again , when he came out of Padan @-@ aram , and blessed him .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins ;
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the midwife said unto her , Fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel 's grave unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father 's concubine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
the sons of Leah ; Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn , and Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Zebulun :
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
these are the names of Esau 's sons ; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau .
and Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau 's son ; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek : these were the sons of Adah Esau 's wife .
and these are the sons of Reuel ; Nahath , and Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah : these were the sons of Bashemath Esau 's wife .
and these were the sons of Aholibamah , the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : and she bare to Esau Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah .
these were dukes of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau ; duke Teman , duke Omar , duke Zepho , duke Kenaz ,
and these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau 's wife ; duke Jeush , duke Jaalam , duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Seir the Horite , who inhabited the land ; Lotan , and Shobal , and Zibeon , and Anah ,
and the children of Shobal were these ; Alvan , and Manahath , and Ebal , Shepho , and Onam .
and these are the children of Zibeon ; both Ajah , and Anah : this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father .
these are the dukes that came of the Horites ; duke Lotan , duke Shobal , duke Zibeon , duke Anah ,
Duke Dishon , duke Ezer , duke Dishan : these are the dukes that came of Hori , among their dukes in the land of Seir .
and Husham died , and hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; duke Timnah , duke Alvah , duke Jetheth ,
Duke Magdiel , duke Iram : these be the dukes of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession : he is Esau the father of the Edomites .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
and his brethren said to him , shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send thee unto them . and he said to him , Here am I.
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
come , and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . and his brethren were content .
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no .
and he knew it , and said , It is my son 's coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him ; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a son ; and called his name Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bare him .
and Er , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD slew him .
and he said , I will send thee a kid from the flock . and she said , Wilt thou give me a pledge , till thou send it ?
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her Vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive his pledge from the woman 's hand : but he found her not .
then he asked the men of that place , saying , Where is the harlot , that was openly by the way side ? and they said , There was no harlot in this place .
and he returned to Judah , and said , I CANNOT find her ; and also the men of the place said , that there was no harlot in this place .
and Judah acknowledged them , and said , She hath been more righteous than I ; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son . and he knew her again no more .
and it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first ,
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called Zarah .
and the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she spake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . and Pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
and we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in unto Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and I have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favoured ; and they fed in a meadow :
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and Joseph said unto Pharaoh , The dream of Pharaoh is one : God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do .
this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : what God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh .
and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Pharaoh called Joseph 's name Zaphnath @-@ paaneah ; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On . and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh : for God , said he , hath made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
and the seven years of plenteousness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them , and said unto them , Ye are spies ; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and they said , Thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
we be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and Judah said unto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they communed with him at the door of the house ,
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , Is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? is he yet alive ?
and he washed his face , and went out , and refrained himself , and said , Set on bread .
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but Benjamin 's mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were merry with him .
and he commanded the steward of his house , saying , Fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondmen .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
and the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
now therefore when I come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad 's life ;
now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith thy son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto thy brethren , This do ye ; Lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night , and said , Jacob , Jacob . and he said , Here am I.
and he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
I will go down with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
these be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padan @-@ aram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
and the sons of Gad ; Ziphion , and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , ERI , and Arodi , and Areli .
and the sons of Asher ; Jimnah , and Ishuah , and Isui , and Beriah , and Serah their sister : and the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
and unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and the sons of Benjamin were Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera , and Naaman , Ehi , and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard .
these are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
these are the sons of Bilhah , which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt , which came out of his loins , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were threescore and six ;
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Now let me die , since I have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and Pharaoh said unto his brethren , What is your occupation ? and they said unto Pharaoh , Thy servants are shepherds , both we , and also our fathers .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became Pharaoh 's .
and they said , Thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh 's .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and he said , swear unto me . and he sware unto him . and Israel bowed himself upon the bed 's head .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Behold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
and they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
and Joseph said unto them , Fear not : for am I in the place of God ?
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
and the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrews strove together : and he said to him that did the wrong , Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
and he said unto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
and Moses said , I will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . and he said , Here am I.
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
and God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
and he said , Cast it on the ground . and he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
and the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ?
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the LORD said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . and he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kissed him .
and Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and afterward Moses and Aaron went in , and told Pharaoh , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness .
and Pharaoh said , Who is the LORD , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I know not the LORD , neither will I let Israel go .
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
but he said , Ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD .
and Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , Lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
and I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .
and I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the LORD .
go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and Moses spake before the LORD , saying , Behold , the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me ; how then shall Pharaoh hear me , who am of uncircumcised lips ?
and the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and the sons of Kohath ; Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel : and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years .
and the sons of Merari ; Mahali and Mushi : these are the families of Levi according to their generations .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
and Eleazar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the LORD said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
that the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , I am the LORD : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
and Moses said before the LORD , Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ?
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the LORD had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
and he hardened Pharaoh 's heart , that he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh 's heart is hardened , he refuseth to let the people go .
and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments : and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD spake unto Moses , Go unto Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the LORD spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and he said , To morrow . and he said , Be it according to thy word : that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , This is the finger of God : and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and Pharaoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for me .
and the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
then the LORD said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh , and tell him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the LORD appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land .
and the LORD did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron , Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the LORD sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the LORD had spoken by Moses .
and Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD .
and he said unto them , Let the LORD be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the LORD ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste ; and he said , I have sinned against the LORD your God , and against you .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
and Pharaoh called unto Moses , and said , Go ye , serve the LORD ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
and Moses said , Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God .
and Moses said , Thus saith the LORD , About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt :
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh : and the LORD hardened Pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the LORD 's passover .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
sanctify unto me all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the LORD 's .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt .
for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .
and the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the angel of God , which went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behind them :
thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
and Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
and Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
so Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and they came to Elim , where were twelve wells of water , and threescore and ten palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
and Moses spake unto Aaron , Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , Come near before the LORD : for he hath heard your murmurings .
and Moses said , Eat that to day ; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chide ye with me ? Wherefore do ye tempt the LORD ?
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
so Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek : and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
then Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took Zipporah , Moses ' wife , after he had sent her back ,
and her two sons ; of which the name of the one was Gershom ; for he said , I have been an alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other was Eliezer ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh :
and Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the LORD delivered them .
and Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
and Jethro said , Blessed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
when they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
so Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
and Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , All that the LORD hath spoken we will do . and Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
and the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
I am the LORD thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : Wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour 's .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
and if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free :
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
and if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
whether he have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ;
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
if it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
and my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
and ye shall be holy men unto me : neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ; ye shall cast it to the dogs .
thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment :
if thou meet thine enemy 's ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
behold , I send an Angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days I will fulfil .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year ; lest the land become desolate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye afar off .
and Moses wrote all the words of the LORD , and rose up early in the morning , and builded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the LORD hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days : and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
and Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and Gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
the staves shall be in the rings of the ark : they shall not be taken from it .
and make one cherub on the one end , and the other cherub on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark ; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , and make thereto a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
and thou shalt make the dishes thereof , and spoons thereof , and covers thereof , and bowls thereof , to cover withal : of pure gold shalt thou make them .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side :
and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of gold , and couple the curtains together with the taches : and it shall be one tabernacle .
and thou shalt make curtains of goats ' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle : eleven curtains shalt thou make .
the length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling , and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of brass , and put the taches into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
and the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering above of Badgers ' skins .
and they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
and thou shalt make bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and thou shalt overlay the boards with gold , and make their rings of gold for places for the bars : and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold .
and thou shalt make a Vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen of cunning work : with cherubims shall it be made :
and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold : their hooks shall be of gold , upon the four sockets of silver .
and thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , wrought with needlework .
and thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood , five cubits long , and five cubits broad ; the altar shall be foursquare : and the height thereof shall be three cubits .
and thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof : his horns shall be of the same : and thou shalt overlay it with brass .
and thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes , and his shovels , and his basons , and his fleshhooks , and his firepans : all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass .
and the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
hollow with boards shalt thou make it : as it was shewed thee in the mount , so shall they make it .
and thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle : for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side :
and the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver .
and likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long , and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
all the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof , and all the pins thereof , and all the pins of the court , shall be of brass .
and they shall make the ephod of gold , of blue , and of purple , of scarlet , and fine twined linen , with cunning work .
and the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
six of their names on one stone , and the other six names of the rest on the other stone , according to their birth .
and thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel : and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial .
and two chains of pure gold at the ends ; of wreathen work shalt thou make them , and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches .
and the fourth row a beryl , and an onyx , and a jasper : they shall be set in gold in their inclosings .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ephod inward .
and Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart , when he goeth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the LORD continually .
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
a golden bell and a pomegranate , a golden bell and a pomegranate , upon the hem of the robe round about .
and thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them , to minister unto me in the priest 's office : take one young bullock , and two rams without blemish ,
and thou shalt put the mitre upon his head , and put the holy crown upon the mitre .
and thou shalt gird them with girdles , Aaron and his sons , and put the bonnets on them : and the priest 's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute : and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons .
but the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering .
thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head .
and thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD .
and that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days , when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place .
and they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made , to consecrate and to sanctify them : but a stranger shall not eat thereof , because they are holy .
and thus shalt thou do unto Aaron , and to his sons , according to all things which I have commanded thee : seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar , and sanctify it ; and it shall be an altar most holy : whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy .
and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an Hin of wine for a drink offering .
this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
and they shall know that I am the LORD their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the LORD their God .
and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon : of shittim wood shalt thou make it .
and thou shalt put it before the Vail that is by the ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation , they shall wash with water , that they die not ; or when they come near to the altar to minister , to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD :
so they shall wash their hands and their feet , that they die not : and it shall be a statute for ever to them , even to him and to his seed throughout their generations .
and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment , an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary : it shall be an holy anointing oil .
upon man 's flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
see , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
and he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
and they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
and the LORD said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
and Moses besought the LORD his God , and said , LORD , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , graven upon the tables .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
and Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
for Moses had said , consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
and Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the LORD talked with Moses .
and I will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount .
and the LORD passed by before him , and proclaimed , The LORD , The LORD God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
and he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the LORD : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
the candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
the hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
and every man , with whom was found blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair , and red skins of rams , and Badgers ' skins , brought them .
and Moses said unto the children of Israel , See , the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ;
and they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it withal . and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning .
and they spake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the LORD commanded to make .
and Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . so the people were restrained from bringing .
and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
one board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
and there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
and he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
and the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , to bear the ark .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the holy anointing oil , and the pure incense of sweet spices , according to the work of the apothecary .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it withal ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the Vail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the brasen altar , and the brasen grate for it , and all the vessels of the altar ,
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
and they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate .
and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO THE LORD .
and they brought the tabernacle unto Moses , the tent , and all his furniture , his taches , his boards , his bars , and his pillars , and his sockets ,
the pure candlestick , with the lamps thereof , even with the lamps to be set in order , and all the vessels thereof , and the oil for light ,
according to all that the LORD commanded Moses , so the children of Israel made all the work .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the LORD had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark :
and he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD ; as the LORD had commanded Moses .
and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal .
when they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
and the LORD called unto Moses , and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying ,
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD , ye shall bring your offering of the cattle , even of the herd , and of the flock .
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD .
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .
and if his offering be of the flocks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without blemish .
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls , then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves , or of young pigeons .
and when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD , his offering shall be of fine flour ; and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frankincense thereon :
and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven , it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , or unleavened wafers anointed with oil .
and if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the LORD , shall be made with leaven : for ye shall burn no leaven , nor any honey , in any offering of the LORD made by fire .
and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
and the skin of the bullock , and all his flesh , with his head , and with his legs , and his inwards , and his dung ,
even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn him as he burned the first bullock : it is a sin offering for the congregation .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein :
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it .
and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the LORD , it shall be wholly burnt .
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
but the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken : and if it be sodden in a brasen pot , it shall be both scoured , and rinsed in water .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul that is above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away :
and the priest that offereth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that offereth it .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD , and it shall be the priest 's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Ye shall eat no manner of fat , of ox , or of sheep , or of goat .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai .
take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the anointing oil , and a bullock for the sin offering , and two rams , and a basket of unleavened bread ;
and Moses did as the LORD commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all his vessels , both the laver and his foot , to sanctify them .
and he brought the bullock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consecration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and Moses took the breast , and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consecration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the LORD , that ye die not : for so I am commanded .
and he said unto Aaron , Take thee a young calf for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before the LORD .
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before the LORD ; and a meat offering mingled with oil : for to day the LORD will appear unto you .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he slew the burnt offering ; and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled round about upon the altar .
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,
and Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and blessed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and peace offerings .
and Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people .
and Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
so they went near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp ; as Moses had said .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying ,
Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the LORD ?
behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
these also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind ,
these are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
and every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are unclean , and shall be unclean unto you .
nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
for I am the LORD your God : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
for I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
this is the law of the beasts , and of the fowl , and of every living creature that moveth in the waters , and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth :
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten .
who shall offer it before the LORD , and make an atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
and if it spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague .
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
he shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more :
but if the scall be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the scall is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
he is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is in his head .
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in the warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen , either in the warp , or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
and the priest shall take one he lamb , and offer him for a trespass offering , and the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD :
and two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
and he shall offer the one of the turtledoves , or of the young pigeons , such as he can get ;
when ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and the vessel of earth , that he toucheth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue .
and if any man 's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
but if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
this is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed goeth from him , and is defiled therewith ;
and the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron , when they offered before the LORD , and died ;
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the Vail :
and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and cleanse it , and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD .
and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you , to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year . and he did as the LORD commanded Moses .
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring . this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , I am the LORD your God .
none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : I am the LORD .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father 's brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to uncover her nakedness ; for they are her near kinswomen : it is wickedness .
also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness .
defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you :
ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ; )
speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the LORD your God am holy .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the LORD your God .
and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD , ye shall offer it at your own will .
it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the morrow : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the LORD your God .
thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him .
thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : I am the LORD .
ye shall keep my statutes . thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the LORD your God .
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the LORD .
do not prostitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just Hin , shall ye have : I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
therefore shall ye observe all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : I am the LORD .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he giveth of his seed unto Molech , and kill him not :
for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
and the man that committeth adultery with another man 's wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour 's wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
and the man that lieth with his father 's wife hath uncovered his father 's nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man take a wife and her mother , it is wickedness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no wickedness among you .
and thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother 's sister , nor of thy father 's sister : for he uncovereth his near kin : they shall bear their iniquity .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother 's nakedness ; they shall be childless .
ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither I bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I abhorred them .
and ye shall be holy unto me : for I the LORD am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the LORD , which sanctify you , am holy .
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the LORD .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the LORD .
the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the priest 's daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the LORD ;
blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts , that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering ; but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
on the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the LORD .
neither shall ye profane my holy name ; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel : I am the LORD which hallow you ,
six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings .
and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor parched corn , nor green ears , until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals : they shall be of fine flour ; they shall be baken with leaven ; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD .
then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering , and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of atonement , to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
ye shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
beside the sabbaths of the LORD , and beside your gifts , and beside all your vows , and beside all your freewill offerings , which ye give unto the LORD .
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
without the Vail of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually , being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant .
bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
and he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the LORD your God .
and Moses spake to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD .
six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the LORD : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
for it is the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy God : for I am the LORD your God .
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubile .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
but as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
for unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
and five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me ; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
then will I also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven times for your sins .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
and I will make your cities waste , and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours .
and I will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be desolate , and your cities waste .
if they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
these are the statutes and judgments and laws , which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses .
and if it be a beast , whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD , all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy .
he shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valuest it , who art the priest , so shall it be .
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jubile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
but the field , when it goeth out in the jubile , shall be holy unto the LORD , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest 's .
and concerning the tithe of the herd , or of the flock , even of whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD .
from twenty years old and upward , all that are able to go forth to war in Israel : thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies .
these are those that were numbered , which Moses and Aaron numbered , and the princes of Israel , being twelve men : each one was for the house of his fathers .
so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
but the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the ensign of their father 's house : far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred .
then the tribe of Zebulun : and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred .
all that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred .
then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp : as they encamp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and two thousand and two hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and five thousand and four hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty and one thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
all they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred . they shall go hindmost with their standards .
bring the tribe of Levi near , and present them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister unto him .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons : they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .
in the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , were eight thousand and six hundred , keeping the charge of the sanctuary .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
and thou shalt give the money , wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed , unto Aaron and to his sons .
from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old , all that enter into the host , to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and when the camp setteth forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering Vail , and cover the ark of testimony with it :
and upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon :
and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet , and cover the same with a covering of Badgers ' skins , and shall put in the staves thereof .
and upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue , and cover it with a covering of Badgers ' skins , and shall put to the staves thereof :
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation :
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the LORD spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man 's wife go aside , and commit a trespass against him ,
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , Amen , amen .
and the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the LORD , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation :
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
and he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings .
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD : this is holy for the priest , with the wave breast and heave shoulder : and after that the Nazarite may drink wine .
and they brought their offering before the LORD , six covered wagons , and twelve oxen ; a wagon for two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they brought them before the tabernacle .
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according unto their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but unto the sons of Kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and the LORD said unto Moses , They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedicating of the altar .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Eliab the son of Helon .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Elizur the son of Shedeur .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Elishama the son of Ammihud .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Abidan the son of Gideoni .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Pagiel the son of Ocran .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan .
this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve chargers of silver , twelve silver bowls , twelve spoons of gold :
the golden spoons were twelve , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary : all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty shekels .
all the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks , the rams twelve , the lambs of the first year twelve , with their meat offering : and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve .
and thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle water of purifying upon them , and let them shave all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites :
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may execute the service of the LORD .
and thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the LORD .
and after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation : and thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them for an offering .
for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and the Levites were purified , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD ; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them .
this is it that belongeth unto the Levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation :
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge .
and the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : Wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
they shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it .
so it was alway : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD , and journeyed not .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran .
and the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward , bearing the tabernacle .
and the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur .
and the Kohathites set forward , bearing the sanctuary : and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud .
thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred .
and he said , Leave us not , I pray thee ; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting : and the children of Israel also wept again , and said , Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick :
but our soul is dried away : there is nothing at all , beside this manna , before our eyes .
then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased .
whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto me , saying , Give us flesh , that we may eat .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in thy sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .
and Moses said , The people , among whom I am , are six hundred thousand footmen ; and thou hast said , I will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
and the LORD said unto Moses , Is the LORD 's hand waxed short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
and they said , Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses ? hath he not spoken also by us ? and the LORD heard it .
and the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses , and unto Aaron , and unto Miriam , Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation . and they three came out .
and the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
and they came unto the brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
and all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
and Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
only rebel not ye against the LORD , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the LORD is with us : fear them not .
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones . and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel .
and the LORD said unto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ere they believe me , for all the signs which I have shewed among them ?
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
the LORD is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
say unto them , As truly as I live , saith the LORD , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will I do to you :
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the LORD have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the LORD .
but Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
and Moses said , Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD ? but it shall not prosper .
then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of oil .
and the fourth part of an Hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an Hin of oil .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the LORD :
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the LORD .
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
and he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD : and what is Aaron , that ye murmur against him ?
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
and take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also , and Aaron , each of you his censer .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the congregation .
and there came out a fire from the LORD , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense .
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye have killed the people of the LORD .
get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment . and they fell upon their faces .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Bring Aaron 's rod again before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the rebels ; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me , that they die not .
and the children of Israel spake unto Moses , saying , Behold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
and the LORD spake unto Aaron , Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou have any part among them : I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and upon which never came yoke :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times :
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
and why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , Hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and he said , Thou shalt not go through . and Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , journeyed from Kadesh , and came unto mount Hor .
and the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ,
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
and when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mourned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
and when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD , and said , If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities .
and the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hormah .
and from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
and from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon .
and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
we have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon , and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
and he said unto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as the LORD shall speak unto me : and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and God said unto Balaam , Thou shalt not go with them ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they are blessed .
and Balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
and they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
for I will promote thee unto very great honour , and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me : come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
now therefore , I pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more .
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
but the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the angel of the LORD , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
and the LORD opened the mouth of the ass , and she said unto Balaam , What have I done unto thee , that thou hast smitten me these three times ?
then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
and when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
and Balaam said unto Balak , Stand by thy burnt offering , and I will go : peradventure the LORD will come to meet me : and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee . and he went to an high place .
and the LORD put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , Return unto Balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . and Balak said unto him , What hath the LORD spoken ?
and he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor :
he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel : the LORD his God is with him , and the shout of a king is among them .
surely there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
and when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : I thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the LORD hath kept thee back from honour .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods : and the people did eat , and bowed down to their gods .
and Israel joined himself unto Baal @-@ peor : and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel .
and Moses said unto the judges of Israel , Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal @-@ peor .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an atonement for the children of Israel .
and Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
these were the numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
and the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt : and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
these are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
for the LORD had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . and there was not left a man of them , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Get thee up into this mount Abarim , and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel .
let the LORD , the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation ,
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering , mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
and a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , one ram , seven lambs of the first year ;
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering , to make an atonement for you :
and ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall afflict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks , two rams , fourteen lambs of the first year without spot :
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded .
so there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the LORD 's tribute was threescore and twelve .
and the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the LORD 's tribute was thirty and two persons .
Wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben , Shall your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them ?
for if ye turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and Moses said unto them , If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the LORD to war ,
and the land be subdued before the LORD : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the LORD , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD .
build you cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
and the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses , saying , Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of Gilead :
and the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , As the LORD hath said unto thy servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours .
and Nebo , and Baal @-@ meon , ( their names being changed , ) and Shibmah : and gave other names unto the cities which they builded .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
and they departed from Succoth , and pitched in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .
and they removed from Marah , and came unto Elim : and in Elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there .
and they removed from Kadesh , and pitched in mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
and king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for I have given you the land to possess it .
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom , and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward :
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .
and the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar @-@ enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down to Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe :
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun .
and the names of the men are these : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
and the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan ;
ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land CANNOT be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD , saying , The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
for Mahlal , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their father 's brothers ' sons :
and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the judgments , which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
and I spake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone :
and I charged your judges at that time , saying , Hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between every man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him .
and I said unto you , Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which the LORD our God doth give unto us .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us .
but Joshua the son of Nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
so I spake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD , and went presumptuously up into the hill .
and ye returned and wept before the LORD ; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
the Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ;
( that also was accounted a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in old time ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims ;
and the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
all the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salchah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi ; and called them after his own name , Bashan @-@ havoth @-@ Jair , unto this day .
I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon .
but the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me : and the LORD said unto me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you .
and ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
and the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
and he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire :
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
but I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
and the LORD shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the LORD shall lead you .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the LORD thy God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the LORD he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
namely , Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
and they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ;
and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of Pisgah .
the LORD made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
the LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood between the LORD and you at that time , to shew you the work of the LORD : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more , then we shall die .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers ,
and the LORD shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
for they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven images with fire .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God : the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
the LORD did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
and the LORD will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh , and unto all Egypt ;
moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
but thou shalt remember the LORD thy God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
a people great and tall , the children of the Anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of Anak !
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you . but the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also .
thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first ; because the LORD had said he would destroy you .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and the LORD said unto me , Arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
thou shalt fear the LORD thy God ; him shalt thou serve , and to him shalt thou cleave , and swear by his name .
thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons ; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house , and upon thy gates :
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them , as the days of heaven upon the earth .
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you , to do them , to love the LORD your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ;
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
but unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee .
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest :
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
even as the Roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
ye shall walk after the LORD your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cleave unto him .
but thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
and all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
certain men , the children of Belial , are gone out from among you , and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , which ye have not known ;
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God , and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose :
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD 's release .
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the LORD thy God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God .
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the Roebuck , and as the hart .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God : for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night .
thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tents .
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God , as all his brethren the Levites do , which stand there before the LORD .
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD : and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee .
the LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
when the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations , whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
and this is the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ;
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the Avenger of blood , that he may die .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
for the LORD your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you agginst your enemies , to save you .
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee :
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of thy vineyard , be defiled .
but if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel :
if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD .
an Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever :
thou shalt not abhor an Edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian ; because thou wast a stranger in his land .
when thou comest into thy neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way , after that ye were come forth out of Egypt .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger , nor of the fatherless ; nor take a widow 's raiment to pledge :
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
if there be a controversy between men , and they come unto judgment , that the judges may judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked .
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
and it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
and when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers , the LORD heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O LORD , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God :
this day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God :
and Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel , saying , Take heed , and hearken , O Israel ; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God .
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
these shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that removeth his neighbour 's landmark . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger , fatherless , and widow . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
the LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , and walk in his ways .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
the LORD shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that CANNOT be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
and thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the LORD bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God .
and the LORD shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
and I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot .
ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink : that ye might know that I am the LORD your God .
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
that then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee .
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
and the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
and the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
and the LORD shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you .
and the LORD , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
and Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacles ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for I know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck : behold , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebellious against the LORD ; and how much more after my death ?
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
give ear , O ye heavens , and I will speak ; and hear , O earth , the words of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
do ye thus requite the LORD , O foolish people and unwise ? is not he thy father that hath bought thee ? hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
he found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter :
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
if I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
and Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hoshea the son of Nun .
and he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
and he was king in Jeshurun , when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together .
and of Levi he said , Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one , whom thou didst prove at Massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah ;
they shall teach Jacob thy judgments , and Israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
and of Dan he said , Dan is a lion 's whelp : he shall leap from Bashan .
and of Asher he said , Let Asher be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
there is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in his excellency on the sky .
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
and the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended .
and Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hearkened unto him , and did as the LORD commanded Moses .
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel .
Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give them .
have not I commanded thee ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , saying , The LORD your God hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
and it was told the king of Jericho , saying , Behold , there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country .
and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the Fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
and she said unto them , Get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
and Joshua said unto the people , Sanctify yourselves : for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua said unto the children of Israel , Come hither , and hear the words of the LORD your God .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man :
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
on that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , in the east border of Jericho .
and he spake unto the children of Israel , saying , When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , What mean these stones ?
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD , that it is mighty : that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever .
at that time the LORD said unto Joshua , Make thee sharp knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised : for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them by the way .
and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho .
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and the captain of the LORD 's host said unto Joshua , Loose thy shoe from off thy foot ; for the place whereon thou standest is holy . and Joshua did so .
and Joshua the son of Nun called the priests , and said unto them , Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the LORD .
and he said unto the people , Pass on , and compass the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , Joshua said unto the people , Shout ; for the LORD hath given you the city .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD .
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
so Joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought Israel by their tribes ; and the tribe of Judah was taken :
and he brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
and Achan answered Joshua , and said , Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done :
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day . so the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger . Wherefore the name of that place was called , The valley of Achor , unto this day .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against Ai : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
and he commanded them , saying , Behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
then ye shall rise up from the ambush , and seize upon the city : for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand .
and all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and slew the men of Ai .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and the men of Israel said unto the Hivites , Peradventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel . and all the congregation murmured against the princes .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
come up unto me , and help me , that we may smite Gibeon : for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel .
and the LORD discomfited them before Israel , and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth @-@ horon , and smote them to Azekah , and unto Makkedah .
and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
then said Joshua , Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave .
and Joshua said unto them , Fear not , nor be dismayed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
and afterward Joshua smote them , and slew them , and hanged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Be not afraid because of them : for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel : thou shalt Hough their horses , and burn their chariots with fire .
and Joshua at that time turned back , and took Hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword : for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms .
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe : and he burnt Hazor with fire .
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Hazor only ; that did Joshua burn .
even from the mount Halak , that goeth up to Seir , even unto Baal @-@ gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon : and all their kings he took , and smote them , and slew them .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon : all other they took in battle .
there was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the LORD said unto Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . and the land rested from war .
and the coast of Og king of Bashan , which was of the remnant of the giants , that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ;
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites , nor the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
and Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families .
and their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
and their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities :
but unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance : the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance , as he said unto them .
for Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them .
and the name of Hebron before was Kirjath @-@ arba ; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims . and the land had rest from war .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ Arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ Shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath @-@ Sepher .
who answered , Give me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and he gave her the upper springs , and the nether springs .
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel , and Eder , and Jagur ,
and Lebaoth , and Shilhim , and Ain , and Rimmon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages :
as for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out : but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho , unto the water of Jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel ,
and goeth out from Bethel to Luz , and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth ,
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti , unto the coast of Beth @-@ horon the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ Shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth , and to Naarath , and came to Jericho , and went out at Jordan .
and there fell ten portions to Manasseh , beside the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side Jordan ;
and the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En @-@ tappuah .
now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah : but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim ;
yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
and the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the description hither to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God .
and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD : and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ Shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Beth @-@ hoglah , and the valley of Keziz ,
and Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath @-@ beer , Ramath of the south . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
and their border went up toward the sea , and Maralah , and reached to Dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before Jokneam ;
and from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah @-@ hepher , to Ittah @-@ kazin , and goeth out to Remmon @-@ methoar to Neah ;
and the coast reacheth to Tabor , and Shahazimah , and Beth @-@ Shemesh ; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
according to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnath @-@ serah in mount Ephraim : and he built the city , and dwelt therein .
and they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali , and Shechem in mount Ephraim , and Kirjath @-@ arba , which is Hebron , in the mountain of Judah .
and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattle .
and the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the LORD , these cities and their suburbs .
and the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
all the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
for they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Gezer with her suburbs ,
and out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer with her suburbs , and Jahazah with her suburbs ,
and said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD ,
the LORD God of gods , the LORD God of gods , he knoweth , and Israel he shall know ; if it be in rebellion , or if in transgression against the LORD , ( save us not this day , )
for the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Reuben and children of Gad ; ye have no part in the LORD : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD .
and it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age .
and Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , I am old and stricken in age :
and ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you .
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and Joshua said unto the people , Ye CANNOT serve the LORD : for he is an holy God ; he is a jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
if ye forsake the LORD , and serve strange gods , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
and they found Adoni @-@ Bezek in Bezek : and they fought against him , and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
and afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron : ( now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath @-@ arba : ) and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath @-@ Sepher :
and she said unto him , Give me a blessing : for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs .
and the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel : and the LORD was with them .
and the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel . ( now the name of the city before was Luz . )
and the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called the name thereof Luz : which is the name thereof unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
and the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the LORD , that he did for Israel .
and Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the LORD was against them for evil , as the LORD had said , and as the LORD had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
now these are the nations which the LORD left , to prove Israel by them , even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan ;
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ;
namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal @-@ Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
and they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
and the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites , and Jebusites :
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD , and forgat the LORD their God , and served Baalim and the groves .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan @-@ rishathaim .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD .
and he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret errand unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . and all that stood by him went out from him .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
then Ehud went forth through the porch , and shut the doors of the parlour upon him , and locked them .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
and they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
so Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . and the land had rest fourscore years .
and after him was Shamgar the son of Anath , which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad : and he also delivered Israel .
and the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD , when Ehud was dead .
and the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , that reigned in Hazor ; the captain of whose host was Sisera , which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
and Barak said unto her , If thou wilt go with me , then I will go : but if thou wilt not go with me , then I will not go .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
and the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
Lord , when thou wentest out of Seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
my heart is toward the governors of Israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . bless ye the LORD .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
the river of Kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river Kishon . O my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
the mother of Sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice , Why is his chariot so long in coming ? why tarry the wheels of his chariots ?
so let all thine enemies perish , O LORD : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might . and the land had rest forty years .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites ; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and I said unto you , I am the LORD your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
and the LORD looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites : have not I sent thee ?
depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
and the angel of God said unto him , Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth . and he did so .
and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD , Gideon said , Alas , O Lord GOD ! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face .
then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD , and called it Jehovah @-@ Shalom : unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi @-@ ezrites .
and they said one to another , Who hath done this thing ? and when they inquired and asked , they said , Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing .
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pitched in the valley of Jezreel .
but the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and Abi @-@ Ezer was gathered after him .
and he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto Asher , and unto Zebulun , and unto Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
and he said unto them , What have I done now in comparison of you ? is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi @-@ Ezer ?
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb : and what was I able to do in comparison of you ? then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
and the princes of Succoth said , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
and Gideon said , Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand , then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers .
then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna , What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor ? and they answered , As thou art , so were they ; each one resembled the children of a king .
and Gideon made an ephod thereof , and put it in his city , even in Ophrah : and all Israel went thither a whoring after it : which thing became a snare unto Gideon , and to his house .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abi @-@ ezrites .
and the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , namely , Gideon , according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel .
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal @-@ berith , wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
but the fig tree said unto them , Should I forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
( for my father fought for you , and adventured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
and the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and cursed Abimelech .
and when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
and Abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
and Gaal spake again and said , See there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim .
and Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people that was therein , and beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
and Abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
and after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim .
moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was sore distressed .
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , saying , We have sinned against thee , both because we have forsaken our God , and also served Baalim .
the Zidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , did oppress you ; and ye cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the LORD : and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and they said unto Jephthah , Come , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of Ammon .
and Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , Did not ye hate me , and expel me out of my father 's house ? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , Therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , The LORD be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
and Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said unto him , Let us pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place .
and the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smote them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
and now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
and Jephthah said unto them , I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
and Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of the Amalekites .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
and there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
and Manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said unto him , Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman ? and he said , I am .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
and Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD , What is thy name , that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour ?
so Manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD : and the angel did wondrously ; and Manoah and his wife looked on .
and the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol .
and Samson went down to Timnath , and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
so his father went down unto the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
but if ye CANNOT declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments . and they said unto him , Put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
and he said unto them , Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . and they could not in three days expound the riddle .
and her father said , I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to thy companion : is not her younger sister fairer than she ? take her , I pray thee , instead of her .
and Samson said concerning them , Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines , though I do them a displeasure .
and Samson said unto them , Though ye have done this , yet will I be avenged of you , and after that I will cease .
and the men of Judah said , Why are ye come up against us ? and they answered , To bind Samson are we come up , to do to him as he hath done to us .
and he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
and Delilah said to Samson , Tell me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
and Samson said unto her , If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and Delilah said unto Samson , Behold , thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : now tell me , I pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
and the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
and Micah said unto him , whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah , and I go to sojourn where I may find a place .
and they said unto him , Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
and they went up , and pitched in Kirjath @-@ jearim , in Judah : Wherefore they called that place Mahaneh @-@ dan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kirjath @-@ jearim .
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them .
and he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?
and the children of Dan said unto him , Let not thy voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the lives of thy household .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : Howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
and his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him unto her father 's house to Bethlehemjudah , and was there four whole months .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
and the old man said , Peace be with thee ; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
and he said unto her , Up , and let us be going . but none answered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and Gat him unto his place .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh . ) Then said the children of Israel , Tell us , how was this wickedness ?
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
and the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , What wickedness is this that is done among you ?
and the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword , beside the inhabitants of Gibeah , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
and the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel : and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh , saying , There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife .
and said , O LORD God of Israel , why is this come to pass in Israel , that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel ?
and the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ?
and this is the thing that ye shall do , Ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon , and to call peaceably unto them .
then the elders of the congregation said , How shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ?
and they said , There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin .
therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ;
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
and Naomi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the LORD deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . and it came to pass , when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Naomi ?
I went out full , and the LORD hath brought me home again empty : why then call ye me Naomi , seeing the LORD hath testified against me , and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech ; and his name was Boaz .
and Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi , Let me now go to the field , and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace . and she said unto her , Go , my daughter .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her HAP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said unto the reapers , The LORD be with you . and they answered him , The LORD bless thee .
and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said , It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab :
and she said , I pray you , let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house .
then said Boaz unto Ruth , Hearest thou not , my daughter ? go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maidens :
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and Ruth the Moabitess said , He said unto me also , Thou shalt keep fast by my young men , until they have ended all my harvest .
and Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law , It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
then Naomi her mother in law said unto her , My daughter , shall I not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
and she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law bade her .
and when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , Who art thou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
then said she , Sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finished the thing this day .
and he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , Sit ye down here . and they sat down .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh . and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of the LORD , were there .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the LORD , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
and the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for the LORD is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
also before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the LORD 's people to transgress .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
and the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli . and the word of the LORD was precious in those days ; there was no open vision .
and the LORD called Samuel again the third time . and he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me . and Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child .
and the LORD said to Samuel , Behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
and therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Eli 's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
and Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the LORD . and Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision .
and the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
woe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods ? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
be strong , and quit yourselves like men , O ye Philistines , that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews , as they have been to you : quit yourselves like men , and fight .
and the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , Fear not ; for thou hast born a son . but she answered not , neither did she regard it .
and she named the child I @-@ chabod , saying , The glory is departed from Israel : because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any that come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day .
but the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod , and he destroyed them , and smote them with emerods , even Ashdod and the coasts thereof .
and the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , What shall we do to the ark of the LORD ? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place .
and when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
and the men of Beth @-@ Shemesh said , Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God ? and to whom shall he go up from us ?
and it came to pass , while the ark abode in Kirjath @-@ jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
and Samuel took a sucking lamb , and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD : and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel ; and the LORD heard him .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abiah : they were judges in Beer @-@ sheba .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
now therefore hearken unto their voice : Howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them , and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king .
and he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the LORD will not hear you in that day .
nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel ; and they said , Nay ; but we will have a king over us ;
that we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and the asses of Kish Saul 's father were lost . and Kish said to Saul his son , Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go . so they went unto the city where the man of God was .
and as they went up the hill to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said unto them , Is the seer here ?
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Behold the man whom I spake to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , where the seer 's house is .
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
then Samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said , Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
and the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
and let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
and it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
and when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
and Saul 's uncle said unto him and to his servant , whither went ye ? and he said , To seek the asses : and when we saw that they were no where , we came to Samuel .
and Saul said unto his uncle , He told us plainly that the asses were found . but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof Samuel spake , he told him not .
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
therefore they inquired of the LORD further , if the man should yet come thither . and the LORD answered , Behold , he hath hid himself among the stuff .
and they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and , behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field ; and Saul said , What aileth the people that they weep ? and they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh .
and when he numbered them in Bezek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , To morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you .
and the people said unto Samuel , Who is he that said , Shall Saul reign over us ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
and Saul said , There shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel .
and all the people went to Gilgal ; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal ; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly .
and now , behold , the king walketh before you : and I am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
and he said unto them , The LORD is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . and they answered , He is witness .
and Samuel said unto the people , It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD , which he did to you and to your fathers .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the LORD , then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the LORD hath set a king over you .
and all the people said unto Samuel , Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which CANNOT profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
for the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people .
moreover as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you : but I will teach you the good and the right way :
and Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it . and Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , Let the Hebrews hear .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
therefore said I , The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal , and I have not made supplication unto the LORD : I forced myself therefore , and offered a burnt offering .
and Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God , which he commanded thee : for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever .
and Samuel arose , and Gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin . and Saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
and Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , abode in Gibeah of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel : for the Philistines said , Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears :
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines , to sharpen every man his share , and his coulter , and his axe , and his mattock .
and Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
but if they say thus , Come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , Behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled , and the earth quaked : so it was a very great trembling .
then said Saul unto the people that were with him , Number now , and see who is gone from us . and when they had numbered , behold , Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there .
and when the people were come into the wood , behold , the honey dropped ; but no man put his hand to his mouth : for the people feared the oath .
then said Jonathan , My father hath troubled the land : see , I pray you , how mine eyes have been enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and Saul built an altar unto the LORD : the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD .
and Saul said , Draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people : and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day .
and he gathered an host , and smote the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them .
and Samuel came to Saul : and Saul said unto him , Blessed be thou of the LORD : I have performed the commandment of the LORD .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
and Samuel said , When thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel ?
now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD .
and as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
then said Samuel , Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites . and Agag came unto him delicately . and Agag said , Surely the bitterness of death is past .
and Samuel said , How can I go ? if Saul hear it , he Will kill me . and the LORD said , Take an heifer with thee , and say , I am come to sacrifice to the LORD .
and he said , peaceably : I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD : sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . and he sanctified Jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
and it came to pass , when they were come , that he looked on Eliab , and said , Surely the LORD 's anointed is before him .
again , Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel . and Samuel said unto Jesse , The LORD hath not chosen these .
then Samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
and Saul sent to Jesse , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Shochoh , which belongeth to Judah , and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah , in Ephes @-@ dammim .
and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
and he had greaves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
and the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul .
and Jesse said unto David his son , Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaves , and run to the camp to thy brethren ;
and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
and he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
and Saul said to David , Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
and David said unto Saul , Thy servant kept his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
and Saul armed David with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
and the Philistine came on and drew near unto David ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
and when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
and Saul said to him , Whose son art thou , thou young man ? and David answered , I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite .
and the women answered one another as they played , and said , Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands .
and Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
but it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul 's daughter should have been given to David , that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife .
and Saul spake to Jonathan his son , and to all his servants , that they should kill David .
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
and Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan : and Saul sware , As the LORD liveth , he shall not be slain .
and there was war again : and David went out , and fought with the Philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter ; and they fled from him .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
and Saul said unto Michal , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? and Michal answered Saul , He said unto me , Let me go ; why should I kill thee ?
if thy father at all miss me , then say , David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city : for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
and thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD , that I die not :
and Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
but if I say thus unto the young man , Behold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go thy way : for the LORD hath sent thee away .
nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day : for he thought , Something hath befallen him , he is not clean ; surely he is not clean .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest : and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David , and said unto him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and the priest answered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hallowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
and David laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
and he changed his behaviour before them , and feigned himself mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down upon his beard .
have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
David therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave Adullam : and when his brethren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down thither to him .
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests that were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?
and David 's men said unto him , Behold , we be afraid here in Judah : how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ?
then David inquired of the LORD yet again . and the LORD answered him and said , Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
then said David , O LORD God of Israel , thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
then said David , Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? and the LORD said , They will deliver thee up .
and David abode in the wilderness in strong holds , and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph . and Saul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
go , I pray you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who hath seen him there : for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly .
and they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
but there came a messenger unto Saul , saying , haste thee , and come ; for the Philistines have invaded the land .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , Behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ Gedi .
and David said to Saul , Wherefore hearest thou men 's words , saying , Behold , David seeketh thy hurt ?
swear now therefore unto me by the LORD , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and Samuel died ; and all the Israelites were gathered together , and lamented him , and buried him in his house at Ramah . and David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Belial , that a man CANNOT speak to him .
and when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
and David said to Abigail , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which sent thee this day to meet me :
and blessed be thy advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel , they spake unto her , saying , David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife .
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
and Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the way . but David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill afar off ; a great space being between them :
and David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , Answerest thou not , Abner ? then Abner answered and said , Who art thou that criest to the king ?
and he said , Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in mine hand ?
and David answered and said , Behold the king 's spear ! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
then Saul said to David , Blessed be thou , my son David : thou shalt both do great things , and also shalt still prevail . so David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
and David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
and Achish believed David , saying , He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him ; therefore he shall be my servant for ever .
and when Saul saw the host of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly trembled .
and Saul sware to her by the LORD , saying , As the LORD liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice : and the woman spake to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceived me ? for thou art Saul .
and the king said unto her , Be not afraid : for what sawest thou ? and the woman said unto Saul , I saw gods ascending out of the earth .
and the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hasted , and killed it , and took flour , and kneaded it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof :
and she brought it before Saul , and before his servants ; and they did eat . then they rose up , and went away that night .
and Achish answered and said to David , I know that thou art good in my sight , as an angel of God : notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , He shall not go up with us to the battle .
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
so David went , he and the six hundred men that were with him , and came to the brook Besor , where those that were left behind stayed .
but David pursued , he and four hundred men : for two hundred abode behind , which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
and the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ Shua , Saul 's sons .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and David said unto him , From whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David said unto the young man that told him , whence art thou ? and he answered , I am the son of a stranger , an Amalekite .
and David said unto him , How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD 's anointed ?
tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streets of Askelon ; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : thy love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ Gilead , and said unto them , Blessed be ye of the LORD , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them .
but Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's host , took Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
and Abner said to Joab , Let the young men now arise , and play before us . and Joab said , Let them arise .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : Wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and there was a very sore battle that day ; and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah , that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
and Joab said , As God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
so Joab blew a trumpet , and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
and Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
and Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
and they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : but David waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and David sent messengers to Ish @-@ bosheth Saul 's son , saying , Deliver me my wife Michal , which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines .
and Ish @-@ bosheth sent , and took her from her husband , even from Phaltiel the son of Laish .
when Joab and all the host that was with him were come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Joab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ? behold , Abner came unto thee ; why is it that thou hast sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
and afterward when David heard it , he said , I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner :
and David said to Joab , and to all the people that were with him , rend your clothes , and gird you with sackcloth , and mourn before Abner . and king David himself followed the bier .
and I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me : the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness .
and the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish @-@ bosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
and David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said unto them , As the LORD liveth , who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron , and spake , saying , Behold , we are thy bone and thy flesh .
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD : and they anointed David king over Israel .
so David dwelt in the fort , and called it the city of David . and David built round about from Millo and inward .
and David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
but when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
and David did so , as the LORD had commanded him ; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
and David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals .
and when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God .
and David was displeased , because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah : and he called the name of the place Perez @-@ uzzah to this day .
and David was afraid of the LORD that day , and said , How shall the ark of the LORD come to me ?
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
and it was so , that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
for thou , O LORD of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , I will build thee an house : therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Seraiah was the scribe ;
then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , from Lo @-@ debar .
now when Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , was come unto David , he fell on his face , and did reverence . and David said , Mephibosheth . and he answered , Behold thy servant !
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said unto him , I have given unto thy master 's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house .
and Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Micha . and all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
Wherefore Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
and when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the host of the mighty men .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the LORD do that which seemeth him good .
and Hadarezer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Helam . and the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
and when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
and David sent and inquired after the woman . and one said , Is not this Bath @-@ sheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ?
and David said to Uriah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for .
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
and the LORD sent Nathan unto David . and he came unto him , and said unto him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
and Nathan said to David , Thou art the man . thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ;
for thou didst it secretly : but I will do this thing before all Israel , and before the sun .
and David said unto Nathan , I have sinned against the LORD . and Nathan said unto David , The LORD also hath put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
and he said , While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept : for I said , Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me , that the child may live ?
and Joab sent messengers to David , and said , I have fought against Rabbah , and have taken the city of waters .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it : lest I take the city , and it be called after my name .
and it came to pass after this , that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her .
and she said unto him , There is no cause : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me . but he would not hearken unto her .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and it came to pass after two full years , that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal @-@ Hazor , which is beside Ephraim : and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
and Absalom came to the king , and said , Behold now , thy servant hath sheepshearers ; let the king , I beseech thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
and the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man Gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Amnon only is dead .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , Help , O king .
and the king said unto her , What aileth thee ? and she answered , I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead .
and thy handmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
and the king said unto the woman , Go to thine house , and I will give charge concerning thee .
and the woman of Tekoah said unto the king , My lord , O king , the iniquity be on me , and on my father 's house : and the king and his throne be guiltless .
for we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which CANNOT be gathered up again ; neither doth God respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that his banished be not expelled from him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
and the king said unto Joab , Behold now , I have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man Absalom again .
and the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . so Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king 's face .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and unto Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a fair countenance .
so Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
and Absalom said unto him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee .
and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
for thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the LORD .
but Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , Absalom reigneth in Hebron .
and Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counseller , from his city , even from Giloh , while he offered sacrifices . and the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
and there came a messenger to David , saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom .
and the king 's servants said unto the king , Behold , thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whither I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and one told David , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth . and Ziba said , I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
it may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction , and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hill 's side over against him , and cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
and Absalom , and all the people the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
and Hushai said unto Absalom , Nay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
and I will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I counselled .
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people that are with him .
nevertheless a lad saw them , and told Absalom : but they went both of them away quickly , and came to a man 's house in Bahurim , which had a well in his court ; whither they went down .
and Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab : which Amasa was a man 's son , whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab 's mother .
and the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
so the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim ;
and a certain man saw it , and told Joab , and said , Behold , I saw Absalom hanged in an oak .
then said Joab , I may not tarry thus with thee . and he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and they took Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
and Joab said unto him , Thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king 's son is dead .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
and the watchman cried , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth . and he came apace , and drew near .
and the watchman saw another man running : and the watchman called unto the porter , and said , Behold another man running alone . and the king said , He also bringeth tidings .
and the king said , Is the young man Absalom safe ? and Ahimaaz answered , When Joab sent the king 's servant , and me thy servant , I saw a great tumult , but I knew not what it was .
but the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , O my son Absalom , O Absalom , my son , my son !
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
for thy servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said , Shall not Shimei be put to death for this , because he cursed the LORD 's anointed ?
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , Wherefore wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ?
and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God : do therefore what is good in thine eyes .
and Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
and the king said unto Barzillai , Come thou over with me , and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem .
and Barzillai said unto the king , How long have I to live , that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem ?
thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king : and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward ?
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
then the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him : and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
so every man of Israel went up from after David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri : but the men of Judah clave unto their king , from Jordan even to Jerusalem .
and one of Joab 's men stood by him , and said , He that favoureth Joab , and he that is for David , let him go after Joab .
and he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel , and to Beth @-@ maachah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then cried a wise woman out of the city , Hear , hear ; say , I pray you , unto Joab , Come near hither , that I may speak with thee .
I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD ?
Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites , What shall I do for you ? and wherewith shall I make the atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD ?
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose . and the king said , I will give them .
and it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
these four were born to the giant in Gath , and fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
and he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the LORD is tried : he is a Buckler to all them that trust in him .
he teacheth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness hath made me great .
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto thy name .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spake to me , He that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the ground , and defended it , and slew the Philistines : and the LORD wrought a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam : and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
and David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate !
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
was he not most honourable of three ? therefore he was their captain : Howbeit he attained not unto the first three .
Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
and they passed over Jordan , and pitched in Aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad , and toward Jazer :
for when David was up in the morning , the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad , David 's seer , saying ,
and David said unto Gad , I am in a great strait : let us fall now into the hand of the LORD ; for his mercies are great : and let me not fall into the hand of man .
so the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba seventy thousand men .
and Gad came that day to David , and said unto him , Go up , rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite .
and Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
all these things did Araunah , as a king , give unto the king . and Araunah said unto the king , The LORD thy God accept thee .
so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
and Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by En @-@ rogel , and called all his brethren the king 's sons , and all the men of Judah the king 's servants :
and she said unto him , My lord , thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders .
is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
and the king sware , and said , As the LORD liveth , that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
then Bath @-@ sheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , Let my lord king David live for ever .
the king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon :
and Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon . and they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and while he yet spake , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule :
and also thus said the king , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and Solomon said , If he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die .
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to thine house .
now the days of David drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
but shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those that eat at thy table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother .
now therefore hold him not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not nay . and the king said unto her , Ask on , my mother : for I will not say thee nay .
and king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
and it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
and the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host : and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar .
and the king sent and called for Shimei , and said unto him , Build thee an house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and go not forth thence any whither .
and Shimei said unto the king , The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said , so will thy servant do . and Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days .
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD , and the commandment that I have charged thee with ?
the king said moreover to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to David my father : therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD , until those days .
and now , O LORD my God , thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
behold , I have done according to thy words : lo , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do judgment .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host : and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests :
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers : and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , all the days of Solomon .
and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , which had heard of his wisdom .
but now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side , so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent .
and Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for : and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
and the LORD gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him : and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a league together .
and Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders did hew them , and the stonesquarers : so they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
and the house which king Solomon built for the LORD , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar .
and the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
and the two doors were of fir tree : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers : and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid , in the month ZIF :
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this porch .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and he made the pillars , and two rows round about upon the one network , to cover the chapiters that were upon the top , with pomegranates : and so did he for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch , four cubits .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it , ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about : the knops were cast in two rows , when it was cast .
and it was an hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies : it contained two thousand baths .
and he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
and every base had four brasen wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had undersetters : under the laver were undersetters molten , at the side of every addition .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the basons . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD :
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basons : and all these vessels , which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD , were of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was ,
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
I have surely built thee an house to dwell in , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
and the king turned his face about , and blessed all the congregation of Israel : ( and all the congregation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which spake with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
and I have set there a place for the ark , wherein is the covenant of the LORD , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let thy word , I pray thee , be verified , which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father .
but will God indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens CANNOT contain thee ; how much less this house that I have builded ?
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers .
moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of thy people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
for they be thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and all the people that were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Millo .
and three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD , and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD . so he finished the house .
and king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion @-@ Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of Edom .
and Hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he had built ,
blessed be the LORD thy God , which delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel : because the LORD loved Israel for ever , therefore made he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD , and for the king 's house , harps also and psalteries for singers : there came no such almug trees , nor were seen unto this day .
beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country .
and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three pound of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots , and with the king at Jerusalem .
but king Solomon loved many strange women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Zidonians , and Hittites ;
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he kept not that which the LORD commanded .
notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father 's sake : but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
and the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house : and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's household among the sons of Pharaoh .
and when hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , beside the mischief that hadad did : and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
and the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious , he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
and he said to Jeroboam , Take thee ten pieces : for thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , Behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam . and Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , unto Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and king Rehoboam consulted with the old men , that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , How do ye advise that I may answer this people ?
but he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter ?
and now whereas my father did Lade you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
and he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of Levi .
for so was it charged me by the word of the LORD , saying , Eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
for it was said to me by the word of the LORD , Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and he spake to his sons , saying , Saddle me the ass . and they saddled him .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
and he laid his carcase in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , Alas , my brother !
go , tell Jeroboam , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel ,
him that Dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that Dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the LORD hath spoken it .
arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
and all Israel shall mourn for him , and bury him : for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam .
moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day : but what ? even now .
and he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
and they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet .
and there were also sodomites in the land : and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel .
and king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem :
and forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
and he took away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
and also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook Kidron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
him that Dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that Dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat .
and his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him , as he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah .
and Zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his stead .
thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet ,
in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah . and the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
and the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : Wherefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
and he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill , Samaria .
but Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD , and did worse than all that were before him .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
and in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years .
so he went and did according unto the word of the LORD : for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
and as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
for thus saith the LORD God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by Elijah .
and the LORD heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
and Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , thy son liveth .
and the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth .
and Ahab called Obadiah , which was the governor of his house . ( now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly :
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
and Ahab said unto Obadiah , Go into the land , unto all fountains of water , and unto all brooks : peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive , that we lose not all the beasts .
was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD , how I hid an hundred men of the LORD 's prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
and Elijah said , As the LORD of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , I will surely shew myself unto him to day .
and it came to pass , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said unto him , Art thou he that troubleth Israel ?
and he answered , I have not troubled Israel ; but thou , and thy father 's house , in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD , and thou hast followed Baalim .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel , and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the groves four hundred , which eat at Jezebel 's table .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
and Elijah said unto them , Take the prophets of Baal ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon , and slew them there .
and Elijah said unto Ahab , Get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain .
and said to his servant , Go up now , look toward the sea . and he went up , and looked , and said , There is nothing . and he said , Go again seven times .
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . and Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
and the hand of the LORD was on Elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree , behold , then an angel touched him , and said unto him , Arise and eat .
and the angel of the LORD came again the second time , and touched him , and said , Arise and eat ; because the journey is too great for thee .
and he came thither unto a cave , and lodged there ; and , behold , the word of the LORD came to him , and he said unto him , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and the LORD said unto him , Go , return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus : and when thou comest , anoint Hazael to be king over Syria :
and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel : and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel @-@ meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room .
and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and warred against it .
and the king of Israel answered and said , My lord , O king , according to thy saying , I am thine , and all that I have .
and Ben @-@ hadad sent unto him , and said , The gods do so unto me , and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me .
and the king of Israel went out , and smote the horses and chariots , and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter .
then he found another man , and said , Smite me , I pray thee . and the man smote him , so that in smiting he wounded him .
and he hasted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets .
and Naboth said to Ahab , The LORD forbid it me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee .
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with Naboth .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
and Ahab said to Elijah , Hast thou found me , O mine enemy ? and he answered , I have found thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD .
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and of Jezebel also spake the LORD , saying , The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel .
him that Dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that Dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
and the king of Israel said unto his servants , Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ?
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth @-@ Gilead , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the king 's hand .
and the king said unto him , How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD ?
and the LORD said , Who shall persuade Ahab , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ Gilead ? and one said on this manner , and another said on that manner .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee .
and the king of Israel said , Take Micaiah , and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
and say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace .
and Micaiah said , If thou return at all in peace , the LORD hath not spoken by me . and he said , hearken , O people , every one of you .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , Surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake .
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and the remnant of the sodomites , which remained in the days of his father Asa , he took out of the land .
for he served Baal , and worshipped him , and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
and he said unto them , What manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
and they answered him , He was an hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins . and he said , It is Elijah the Tishbite .
again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty . and he answered and said unto him , O man of God , thus hath the king said , Come down quickly .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah , Go down with him : be not afraid of him . and he arose , and went down with him unto the king .
and it came to pass , when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood to view afar off : and they two stood by Jordan .
and he said , Thou hast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made .
and Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster , and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs , and an hundred thousand rams , with the wool .
and the king of Israel said , Alas ! that the LORD hath called these three kings together , to deliver them into the hand of Moab !
and Jehoshaphat said , The word of the LORD is with him . so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
and Elisha said , As the LORD of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
and ye shall smite every fenced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on armour , and upward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and they said , This is blood : the kings are surely slain , and they have smitten one another : now therefore , Moab , to the spoil .
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward smiting the Moabites , even in their country .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and it fell on a day , that he came thither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and he said , About this season , according to the time of life , thou shalt embrace a son . and she said , Nay , my lord , thou man of God , do not lie unto thine handmaid .
and he said , Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day ? it is neither new moon , nor sabbath . and she said , It shall be well .
and the mother of the child said , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee . and he arose , and followed her .
and when Elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the LORD .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
so he set it before them , and they did eat , and left thereof , according to the word of the LORD .
and Elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
are not Abana and Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? may I not wash in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . and when Naaman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the chariot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . and Elisha said unto him , whence comest thou , Gehazi ? and he said , Thy servant went no whither .
the leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever . and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow .
and the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha , Behold now , the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us .
and he said , Go and spy where he is , that I may send and fetch him . and it was told him , saying , Behold , he is in Dothan .
and he said , If the LORD do not help thee , whence shall I help thee ? out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ?
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Behold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate : and they said one to another , Why sit we here until we die ?
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
and the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done .
and Elisha came to Damascus ; and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hither .
and he settled his countenance stedfastly , until he was ashamed : and the man of God wept .
and Hazael said , But what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ? and Elisha answered , The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria .
and in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the LORD .
so Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him : and he rose by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots : and the people fled into their tents .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign .
two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
and Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , Gird up thy loins , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to Ramoth @-@ Gilead :
and when thou comest thither , look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the LORD , at the hand of Jezebel .
and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah :
and the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her . and he opened the door , and fled .
then they hasted , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trumpets , saying , Jehu is king .
and the watchman told , saying , He came even unto them , and cometh not again : and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he driveth furiously .
and Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
and when Jehu was come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs .
and he said , Throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
and when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , Go , see now this cursed woman , and bury her : for she is a king 's daughter .
and they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel ; so that they shall not say , This is Jezebel .
and Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . and Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , unto the rulers of Jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up Ahab 's children , saying ,
look even out the best and meetest of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD , which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab : for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah .
and when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the LORD , which he spake to Elijah .
and Jehu gathered all the people together , and said unto them , Ahab served Baal a little ; but Jehu shall serve him much .
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , which made Israel to sin .
from Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , even Gilead and Bashan .
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD 's people ; between the king also and the people .
in the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign ; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zibiah of Beer @-@ sheba .
let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found .
and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD :
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and Jehoahaz besought the LORD , and the LORD hearkened unto him : for he saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
( and the LORD gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel sin , but walked therein : and there remained the grove also in Samaria . )
neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he said , Take the arrows . and he took them . and he said unto the king of Israel , Smite upon the ground . and he smote thrice , and stayed .
and the man of God was wroth with him , and said , Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times ; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it : whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice .
and Elisha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us look one another in the face .
but Amaziah would not hear . therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth @-@ Shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
for the LORD saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any helper for Israel .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Amaziah had done ;
save that the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places .
this was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu , saying , Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned a full month in Samaria .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
Howbeit the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places . he built the higher gate of the house of the LORD .
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God , like David his father .
and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
and the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
and he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the LORD , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the LORD , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the laver from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it , and put it upon a pavement of stones .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
and walked in the statutes of the heathen , whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger :
and they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
and the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the LORD : therefore the LORD sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land .
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared the LORD , and served their own gods , after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence .
and the statutes , and the ordinances , and the law , and the commandment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
but the LORD your God ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
he smote the Philistines , even unto Gaza , and the borders thereof , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
and at the end of three years they took it : even in the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
and the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes :
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah , and took them .
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and Rab @-@ shakeh said unto them , Speak ye now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
thou sayest , ( but they are but vain words , ) I have counsel and strength for the war . now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
and he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
and they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say to your master , Thus saith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD , and spread it before the LORD .
Lord , bow down thine ear , and hear : open , LORD , thine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent him to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places .
hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the LORD .
I beseech thee , O LORD , remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
and Hezekiah said unto Isaiah , What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day ?
and Isaiah said , This sign shalt thou have of the LORD , that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forth ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
and Hezekiah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
at that time Berodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah , and said unto him , What said these men ? and from whence came they unto thee ? and Hezekiah said , They are come from a far country , even from Babylon .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the LORD .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hephzi @-@ bah .
and I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
and Shaphan the scribe shewed the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book . and Shaphan read it before the king .
and the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asahiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
and he said , Let him alone ; let no man move his bones . so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria .
and the king commanded all the people , saying , Keep the passover unto the LORD your God , as it is written in the book of this covenant .
surely there was not Holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , wherein this passover was Holden to the LORD in Jerusalem .
notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal .
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .

Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ;
and also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the LORD would not pardon .
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem three months . and his mother 's name was Nehushta , the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
and he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
and all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho : and all his army were scattered from him .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
and they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
and the pots , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away out of their land .

and Ziza the son of Shiphi , the son of Allon , the son of Jedaiah , the son of Shimri , the son of Shemaiah ;
and they went to the entrance of Gedor , even unto the east side of the valley , to seek pasture for their flocks .
and they found fat pasture and good , and the land was wide , and quiet , and peaceable ; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old .
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Seir , having for their captains Pelatiah , and Neariah , and Rephaiah , and Uzziel , the sons of Ishi .
and Bela the son of Azaz , the son of Shema , the son of Joel , who dwelt in Aroer , even unto Nebo and Baal @-@ meon :

now the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and when they had stripped him , they took his head , and his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to carry tidings unto their idols , and to the people .
and they put his armour in the house of their gods , and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon .
and the inhabitants of Jebus said to David , Thou shalt not come hither . nevertheless David took the castle of Zion , which is the city of David .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel .
and this is the number of the mighty men whom David had ; Jashobeam , and Hachmonite , the chief of the captains : he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time .
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
and David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , that is at the gate !
and Abishai the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
also the valiant men of the armies were , Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
now these are they that came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
the chief was Ahiezer , then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite ; and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth ; and Berachah , and Jehu the Antothite ,

and they helped David against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host .
for at that time day by day there came to David to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of God .
the children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valour , and of his father 's house twenty and two captains .
and of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make David king .
and of the children of Issachar , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us : for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul .
so David gathered all Israel together , from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hamath , to bring the ark of God from Kirjath @-@ jearim .
and they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart .
and David and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing , and with harps , and with psalteries , and with timbrels , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
and the ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ Edom in his house three months . and the LORD blessed the house of Obed @-@ Edom , and all that he had .
now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem ; Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
and David inquired of God , saying , Shall I go up against the Philistines ? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up ; for I will deliver them into thine hand .
and the fame of David went out into all lands ; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations .
and David made him houses in the city of David , and prepared a place for the ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
and the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD .
and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with psalteries on Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps on the Sheminith to excel .
and Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was for song : he instructed about the song , because he was skilful .
and it came to pass , when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams .
so they brought the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God .
give thanks unto the LORD , call upon his name , make known his deeds among the people .
give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come before him : worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice : and let men say among the nations , The LORD reigneth .
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD , because he cometh to judge the earth .
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work required :
and with them heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the LORD , because his mercy endureth for ever ;
and with them heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . and the sons of Jeduthun were porters .
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
O LORD , for thy servant 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
O LORD , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for thou , O my God , hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house : therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee .
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , O LORD , and it shall be blessed for ever .
and David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : David also houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them an hundred chariots .
likewise from Tibhath , and from Chun , cities of Hadarezer , brought David very much brass , wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
these were born unto the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people , Go , number Israel from Beer @-@ sheba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
and Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
and as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
and David built there an altar unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the LORD ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
but David could not go before it to inquire of God : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD .
and David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the joinings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel .
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God :
he shall build an house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever .
only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning Israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God .
so when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
moreover four thousand were porters ; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made , said David , to praise therewith .
and David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi , namely , Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
the sons of Laadan ; the chief was Jehiel , and Zetham , and Joel , three .
and the sons of Shimei were , Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . these four were the sons of Shimei .
and Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father 's house .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths , in the new moons , and on the set feasts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the LORD :
and David distributed them , both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , according to their offices in their service .
these were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him .
and the rest of the sons of Levi were these : of the sons of Amram ; Shubael : of the sons of Shubael ; Jehdeiah .
and the sons of Hebron ; Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , Jekameam the fourth .
all these were the sons of heman the king 's seer in the words of God , to lift up the horn . and God gave to heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
concerning the divisions of the porters : of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore , of the sons of Asaph .
also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour .
the sons of Shemaiah ; Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brethren were strong men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ; )
among these were the divisions of the porters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the LORD .
to Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward , with the gate Shallecheth , by the causeway of the going up , ward against ward .
and of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Jehieli ; Zetham , and Joel his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD .
of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month .
and over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite , and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler : in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , a chief priest : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
of the children of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of Azaziah : of the half tribe of Manasseh , Joel the son of Pedaiah :
of Dan , Azareel the son of Jeroham . these were the princes of the tribes of Israel .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David .
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite : and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite :
also Jonathan David 's uncle was a counseller , a wise man , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar : and the general of the king 's army was Joab .
and of all my sons , ( for the LORD hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel .
and he said unto me , Solomon thy son , he shall build my house and my courts : for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
take heed now ; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
all this , said David , the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me , even all the works of this pattern .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to overlay the walls of the houses withal :
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testimonies , and thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the LORD , and the king .
and the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath @-@ jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the LORD : and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
now , O LORD God , let thy promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reigned over Israel .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
but who is able to build him an house , seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens CANNOT contain him ? who am I then , that I should build him an house , save only to burn sacrifice before him ?
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah , where the LORD appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
and he made the most holy house , the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits : and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work , and overlaid them with gold .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
moreover he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits the length thereof , and twenty cubits the breadth thereof , and ten cubits the height thereof .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
and Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basons . and Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths ; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath , to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars .
the pots also , and the shovels , and the fleshhooks , and all their instruments , did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also , and the tables whereon the shewbread was set ;
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
but I have built an house of habitation for thee , and a place for thy dwelling for ever .
now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel .
and said , O LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keepest covenant , and shewest mercy unto thy servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens CANNOT contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , O LORD my God , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee :
that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
now therefore arise , O LORD God , into thy resting place , thou , and the ark of thy strength : let thy priests , O LORD God , be clothed with salvation , and let thy saints rejoice in goodness .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great congregation , from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt .
thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
and the LORD appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if I shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if I command the locusts to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom , according as I have covenanted with David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel .
but if ye turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth @-@ horon the upper , and Beth @-@ horon the nether , fenced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of thy wisdom :
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon .
and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield . and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us ?
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
so the king hearkened not unto the people : for the cause was of God , that the LORD might perform his word , which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the LORD :
and after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers .
and Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters . )
and Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
and it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the LORD , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the LORD ,
nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries .
and when the king entered into the house of the LORD , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
and there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
and when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the LORD , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers .
and Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God :
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
and there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots ; and came unto Mareshah .
then Asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
and they smote all the cities round about Gerar ; for the fear of the LORD came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
then Asa was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and Asa oppressed some of the people the same time .
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which Asa his father had taken .
but sought to the LORD God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah .
also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and tribute silver ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats .
and next to him was Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand .
and of Benjamin ; Eliada a mighty man of valour , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand .
and Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron , and said , Thus saith the LORD , With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed .
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth @-@ Gilead , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
again he said , Therefore hear the word of the LORD ; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
and the LORD said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ Gilead ? and one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee .
and say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love them that hate the LORD ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD .
and he charged them , saying , Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
then there came some that told Jehoshaphat , saying , There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ; and , behold , they be Hazazon @-@ tamar , which is En @-@ Gedi .
and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the LORD , before the new court ,
art not thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever ?
and now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir , whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not ;
behold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of thy possession , which thou hast given us to inherit .
and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD , worshipping the LORD .
and when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel .
and Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
and he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat , Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah thereto .
forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign , and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
but when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , Behold , the king 's son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , God save the king .
now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the LORD :
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there .
and Jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD , that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in .
and at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD .
and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the LORD ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
and they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD .
thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . and when he died , he said , The LORD look upon it , and require it .
for the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men , and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand , because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers . so they executed judgment against Joash .
and these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , but not with a perfect heart .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
and Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the Chidren of Seir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
and Judah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Amaziah did .
and he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the LORD , God made him to prosper .
and the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he transgressed against the LORD his God , and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jerushah , the daughter of Zadok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Uzziah did : Howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD . and the people did yet corruptly .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD , like David his father :
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all valiant men ; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers .
and Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah that was next to the king .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the captives again , which ye have taken captive of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you .
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the LORD , and repaired them .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD , and turned their backs .
now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us .
my sons , be not now negligent : for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him , to serve him , and that ye should minister unto him , and burn incense .
and of the sons of Elizaphan ; Shimri , and Jeiel : and of the sons of Asaph ; Zechariah , and Mattaniah :
and of the sons of heman ; Jehiel , and Shimei : and of the sons of Jeduthun ; Shemaiah , and Uzziel .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the LORD .
then Hezekiah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the LORD .
and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
and all the congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded : and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the LORD .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the LORD .
and Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers .
and all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD .
both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges by their courses ;
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the LORD our God to help us , and to fight our battles . and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , Ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense upon it ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and for this cause Hezekiah the king , and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz , prayed and cried to heaven .
and many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem , and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah : so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick to the death , and prayed unto the LORD : and he spake unto him , and he gave him a sign .
but Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath upon him , and upon Judah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for Baalim , and made groves , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
also he built altars in the house of the LORD , whereof the LORD had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
so Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err , and to do worse than the heathen , whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel .
Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
and when he was in affliction , he besought the LORD his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
and he repaired the altar of the LORD , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house :
even to the artificers and builders gave they it , to buy hewn stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed .
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service : and of the Levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
and Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
and Shaphan carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to thy servants , they do it .
and the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
and he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem : and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
so kill the passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
and his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
and the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem , and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
and when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
moreover all the chief of the priests , and the people , transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen ; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem .
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
thus saith Cyrus king of Persia , The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .
and this is the number of them : thirty chargers of gold , a thousand chargers of silver , nine and twenty knives ,
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
which came with Zerubbabel : Jeshua , Nehemiah , Seraiah , Reelaiah , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispar , Bigvai , Rehum , Baanah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy and four .
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Ami .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
beside their servants and their maids , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women .
their camels , four hundred thirty and five ; their asses , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Artaxerxes the king ; Thy servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known unto the king , that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem , building the rebellious and the bad city , and have set up the walls thereof , and joined the foundations .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ;
we certify the king that , if this city be builded again , and the walls thereof set up , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem . so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
and said unto him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be builded in his place .
with three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expences be given out of the king 's house :
now therefore , Tatnai , governor beyond the river , Shethar @-@ boznai , and your companions the Apharsachites , which are beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
then Tatnai , governor on this side the river , Shethar @-@ boznai , and their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
now after these things , in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia , Ezra the son of Seraiah , the son of Azariah , the son of Hilkiah ,
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king , and of his seven counsellers , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
of the sons of Shechaniah , of the sons of Pharosh ; Zechariah : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
also of the Nethinims , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinims : all of them were expressed by name .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of Ahava , that we might afflict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
and I said unto them , Ye are holy unto the LORD ; the vessels are holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers .
so took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God .
arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
then arose Ezra , and made the chief priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . and they sware .
and they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
and Ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , Ye have transgressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the trespass of Israel .
now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
and of the sons of Harim ; Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Parosh ; Ramiah , and Jeziah , and Malchiah , and Miamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
and of the sons of ELAM ; Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , and Abdi , and Jeremoth , and Eliah .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . and it came to pass in the month Chisleu , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and they said unto me , The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach : the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire .
and said , I beseech thee , O LORD God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou commandedst thy servant Moses .
now these are thy servants and thy people , whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power , and by thy strong hand .
Wherefore the king said unto me , Why is thy countenance sad , seeing thou art not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . then I was very sore afraid ,
moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till I come into Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
and next unto him builded the men of Jericho . and next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri .
and next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph , even over against his house . and next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah .
and next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , he and his daughters .
the valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate .
after him repaired the Levites , Rehum the son of Bani . next unto him repaired Hashabiah , the ruler of the half part of Keilah , in his part .
after him repaired their brethren , Bavai the son of Henadad , the ruler of the half part of Keilah .
and next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall .
after him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece , from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
after him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece , from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall , even unto the corner .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel , unto the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that lieth out .
hear , O our God ; for we are despised : and turn their reproach upon their own head , and give them for a prey in the land of captivity :
and cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
and our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the work to cease .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
for there were that said , We , our sons , and our daughters , are many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
also I said , It is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies ?
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
and I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work , so that I CANNOT come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave it , and come down to you ?
for they all made us afraid , saying , Their hands shall be weakened from the work , that it be not done . now therefore , O God , strengthen my hands .
and , lo , I perceived that God had not sent him ; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me : for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
my God , think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works , and on the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
the children of Pahath @-@ Moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen .
the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred forty and three .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
beside their manservants and their maidservants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver .
and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved .
and they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month :
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackclothes , and earth upon them .
then stood up upon the stairs , of the Levites , Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani , and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God .
thou art the LORD the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ;
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and laws , by the hand of Moses thy servant :
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Sihon , and the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for thou hast done right , but we have done wickedly :
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept thy law , nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
also we made ordinances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ;
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground , and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the LORD :
and the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts to dwell in other cities .
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
also of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hashub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
Zanoah , Adullam , and in their villages , at Lachish , and the fields thereof , at Azekah , and in the villages thereof . and they dwelt from Beer @-@ sheba unto the valley of Hinnom .
and in the days of Joiakim were priests , the chief of the fathers : of Seraiah , Meraiah ; of Jeremiah , Hananiah ;
the Levites in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , were recorded chief of the fathers : also the priests , to the reign of Darius the Persian .
also from the house of Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth : for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem .
then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate :
also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced : for God had made them rejoice with great joy : the wives also and the children rejoiced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : Howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing .
and before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah :
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
and it grieved me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
and I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ? and I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
thus cleansed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites , every one in his business ;
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the firstfruits . remember me , O my God , for good .
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days .
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ;
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
and the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's Chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
then the king 's servants , which were in the king 's gate , said unto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king 's commandment ?
and the king said unto Haman , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
the posts went out , being hastened by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given in Shushan the palace . and the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city Shushan was perplexed .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city , which was before the king 's gate .
and Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king 's treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther , Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the Jews .
then said the king unto her , What wilt thou , queen Esther ? and what is thy request ? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom .
and Esther answered , If it seem good unto the king , let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him .
then the king said , Cause Haman to make haste , that he may do as Esther hath said . so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
and the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Haman said moreover , Yea , Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
and the king said , What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this ? then said the king 's servants that ministered unto him , There is nothing done for him .
and the king 's servants said unto him , Behold , Haman standeth in the court . and the king said , Let him come in .
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear , and the horse that the king rideth upon , and the crown royal which is set upon his head :
and while they were yet talking with him , came the king 's Chamberlains , and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared .
then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen , Who is he , and where is he , that Durst presume in his heart to do so ?
on that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews ' enemy unto Esther the queen . and Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was unto her .
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , Behold , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries :
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
and all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them .
thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews , slew they ; but on the spoil laid they not their hand .
then said Esther , If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows .
and the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons .
for the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
but the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof ; and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
to stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God , and eschewed evil .
now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will curse thee to thy face .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
then Job arose , and rent his mantle , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ,
but put forth thine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
so went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived .
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
his children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance .
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness : and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong .
but he saveth the poor from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
behold , happy is the man whom God correcteth : therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty :
even that it would please God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
then should I yet have comfort ; yea , I would harden myself in sorrow : let him not spare ; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook , and as the stream of brooks they pass away ;
what time they wax warm , they vanish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
teach me , and I will hold my tongue : and cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and become loathsome .
therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
he is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against him , and hath prospered ?
behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ? who will say unto him , What doest thou ?
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
now my days are swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
they are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey .
if I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself :
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and wilt thou bring me into dust again ?
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
a land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
for vain man would be wise , though man be born like a wild ass 's colt .
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee :
he discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
they grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man .
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another , do ye so mock him ?
hold your peace , let me alone , that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
for thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
he cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
he runneth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of his bucklers :
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
his archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
when a few years are come , then I shall go the way whence I shall not return .
lay down now , put me in a surety with thee ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou are my mother , and my sister .
how long will it be ere ye make an end of words ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle , and his candle shall be put out with him .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
surely such are the dwellings of the wicked , and this is the place of him that knoweth not God .
these ten times have ye reproached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
they that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight .
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
his bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
for ye say , Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked ?
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath .
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
is not God in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
yet he filled their houses with good things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
on the left hand , where he doth work , but I CANNOT behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I CANNOT see him :
but he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
why , seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty , do they that know him not see his days ?
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
how then can man be justified with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
as God liveth , who hath taken away my judgment ; and the Almighty , who hath vexed my soul ;
for what is the hope of the hypocrite , though he hath gained , when God taketh away his soul ?
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
it CANNOT be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
no mention shall be made of coral , or of pearls : for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , yea , and searched it out .
and unto man he said , Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
the young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and stood up .
and they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
I chose out their way , and sat chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourners .
but now they that are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
my harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that weep .
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour 's door ;
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother 's womb ; )
for I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
behold , I am according to thy wish in God 's stead : I also am formed out of the clay .
behold , in this thou art not just : I will answer thee , that God is greater than man .
he looketh upon men , and if any say , I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ;
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
when he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
should it be according to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest .
but now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity :
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee .
for he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
and it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
touching the Almighty , we CANNOT find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
have the gates of death been opened unto thee ? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
who provideth for the raven his food ? when his young ones cry unto God , they wander for lack of meat .
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve ?
their young ones are in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto them .
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
he saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
hast thou an arm like God ? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him ?
behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
he taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares .
lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
the arrow CANNOT make him flee : slingstones are turned with him into stubble .
so the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
after this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after leasing ? Selah .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high .
the fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas .
the LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . Higgaion . Selah .
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doth he murder the innocent : his eyes are privily set against the poor .
in the LORD put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Flee as a bird to your mountain ?
for the oppression of the poor , for the sighing of the needy , now will I arise , saith the LORD ; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him .
how long wilt thou forget me , O LORD ? for ever ? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me ?
Lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke , O LORD , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils .
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
the law of the LORD is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the LORD is sure , making wise the simple .
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great transgression .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . O LORD my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
for I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
Oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
many sorrows shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the LORD , mercy shall compass him about .
be glad in the LORD , and rejoice , ye righteous : and shout for joy , all ye that are upright in heart .
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
all my bones shall say , LORD , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off .
he is ever merciful , and lendeth ; and his seed is blessed .
the LORD will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Mizar .
yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand , and plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness ; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things .
the princes of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Abraham : for the shields of the earth belong unto God : he is greatly exalted .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount Zion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me : and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Selah .
every one of them is gone back : they are altogether become filthy ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee : thou hast put them to shame , because God hath despised them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion ! when God bringeth back the captivity of his people , Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
as a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
thou visitest the earth , and waterest it : thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God , which is full of water : thou preparest them corn , when thou hast so provided for it .
the pastures are clothed with flocks ; the valleys also are covered over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
if I regard iniquity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me :
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nations upon earth . Selah .
the chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
thou hast ascended on high , thou hast led captivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the LORD God might dwell among them .
but God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
the Lord said , I will bring again from Bashan , I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea :
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O LORD , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and let me not sink : let me be delivered from them that hate me , and out of the deep waters .
reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
by thee have I been Holden up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother 's bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
now also when I am old and grayheaded , O God , forsake me not ; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation , and thy power to every one that is to come .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain ; violence covereth them as a garment .
if I say , I will speak thus ; behold , I should offend against the generation of thy children .
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary , they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground .
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked : forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever .
all the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
but he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ;
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
keep not thou silence , O God : hold not thy peace , and be not still , O God .
make their nobles like Oreb , and like Zeeb : yea , all their princes as Zebah , and as Zalmunna :
bow down thine ear , O LORD , hear me : for I am poor and needy .
teach me thy way , O LORD ; I will walk in thy truth : unite my heart to fear thy name .
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD ? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD ?
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him .
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , I have laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of the people .

ye that love the LORD , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
make a joyful noise unto the LORD , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
whoso privily slandereth his neighbour , him will I cut off : him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer .
but the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children 's children ;
to such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them .
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;

that I may see the good of thy chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation , that I may glory with thine inheritance .
O God , my heart is fixed ; I will sing and give praise , even with my glory .

he maketh the barren woman to keep house , and to be a joyful mother of children . praise ye the LORD .
they have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their throat .
the heaven , even the heavens , are the LORD 's : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
in the courts of the LORD 's house , in the midst of thee , O Jerusalem . praise ye the LORD .
they compassed me about ; yea , they compassed me about : but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them .
blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD : we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD .
thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful .
let thine hand help me ; for I have chosen thy precepts .
in my distress I cried unto the LORD , and he heard me .
whither the tribes go up , the tribes of the LORD , unto the testimony of Israel , to give thanks unto the name of the LORD .
peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
do good , O LORD , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
he that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him .
surely I have behaved and quieted myself , as a child that is weaned of his mother : my soul is even as a weaned child .
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them , their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore .
it is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron 's beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
as the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the LORD commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
praise ye the LORD . praise ye the name of the LORD ; praise him , O ye servants of the LORD .
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , Sing us one of the songs of Zion .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and thy right hand shall save me .
the LORD will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
O LORD , thou hast searched me , and known me .
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .
the proud have hid a snare for me , and cords ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gins for me . Selah .
as for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
the LORD openeth the eyes of the blind : the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down : the LORD loveth the righteous :
let them praise the name of the LORD : for he commanded , and they were created .
he hath also stablished them for ever and ever : he hath made a decree which shall not pass .
kings of the earth , and all people ; princes , and all judges of the earth :
if they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause :
let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof .
turn you at my reproof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known my words unto you .

when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet .
be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh .
when thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
but the path of the just is as the shining light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day .
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ravished always with her love .
his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be Holden with the cords of his sins .
for the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life :
for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread : and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life .
and , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot , and subtil of heart .
therefore came I forth to meet thee , diligently to seek thy face , and I have found thee .
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
he goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;
for she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
she crieth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .

thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of Amana , from the top of Shenir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
thy lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door , and my bowels were moved for him .
I rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with myrrh , and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh , upon the handles of the lock .
what is thy beloved more than another beloved , O thou fairest among women ? what is thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ?
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranates budded .
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that goeth down sweetly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , until he please .

and upon all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ,

in that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel .
now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard . my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :

but the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness .
that say , Let him make speed , and hasten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent , their horses ' hoofs shall be counted like flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind :
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .

and he said , Hear ye now , O house of David ; Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my God also ?
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
moreover the LORD said unto me , Take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man 's pen concerning Maher @-@ shalal @-@ hash @-@ baz .

and I will wait upon the LORD , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise , and garments rolled in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .

therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him , and join his enemies together ;
the ancient and honourable , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
for the leaders of this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :

their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
and Babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldees ' excellency , shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .

the burden of Moab . because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
and Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab ; the howling thereof unto Eglaim , and the howling thereof unto Beer @-@ elim .
for the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood : for I will bring more upon Dimon , lions upon him that escapeth of Moab , and upon the remnant of the land .

the burden of Damascus . behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it shall be a ruinous heap .
the fortress also shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , saith the LORD of hosts .

thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
yea , in the way of thy judgments , O LORD , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to thy name , and to the remembrance of thee .

hath he smitten him , as he smote those that smote him ? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him ?
in measure , when it shooteth forth , thou wilt debate with it : he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind .

and your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
bread corn is bruised ; because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
this also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all that fight against her and her munition , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
the meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquity are cut off :
therefore thus saith the LORD , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob , Jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
woe to the rebellious children , saith the LORD , that take counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin :
for the Egyptians shall help in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have I cried concerning this , Their strength is to sit still .
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and though the Lord give you the bread of adversity , and the water of affliction , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more , but thine eyes shall see thy teachers :
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver , and the ornament of thy molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of the LORD cometh from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire :
as birds flying , so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem ; defending also he will deliver it ; and passing over he will preserve it .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers ; yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city :
because the palaces shall be forsaken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ;
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
O LORD , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou their arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller : as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them .
the LORD is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness .
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times , and strength of salvation : the fear of the LORD is his treasure .
the highways lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : he hath broken the covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth no man .
hear , ye that are far off , what I have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
thy tacklings are loosed ; they could not well strengthen their mast , they could not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hearken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations , and his fury upon all their armies : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their slain also shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up out of their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
for my sword shall be bathed in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon Idumea , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
and the unicorns shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls ; and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness .
and thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
there shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and hatch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vultures also be gathered , every one with her mate .
seek ye out of the book of the LORD , and read : no one of these shall fail , none shall want her mate : for my mouth it hath commanded , and his spirit it hath gathered them .
say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
and the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with reeds and rushes .
no lion shall be there , nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon , it shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah , and took them .
and the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army . and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
then came forth unto him Eliakim , Hilkiah 's son , which was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , Asaph 's son , the recorder .
I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
and he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD , and spread it before the LORD .
incline thine ear , O LORD , and hear ; open thine eyes , O LORD , and see : and hear all the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
and said , Remember now , O LORD , I beseech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD , that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken ;
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness :
I reckoned till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bones : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
like a crane or a swallow , so did I chatter : I did mourn as a dove : mine eyes fail with looking upward : O LORD , I am oppressed ; undertake for me .
what shall I say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it : I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
for the grave CANNOT praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit CANNOT hope for thy truth .
Hezekiah also had said , What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD ?
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the LORD .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said Hezekiah to Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . he said moreover , For there shall be peace and truth in my days .
speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned : for she hath received of the LORD 's hand double for all her sins .
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain :
the voice said , Cry . and he said , What shall I cry ? all flesh is grass , and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field :
behold , the Lord GOD will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
with whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
the workman melteth a graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold , and casteth silver chains .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image , that shall not be moved .
have ye not known ? have ye not heard ? hath it not been told you from the beginning ? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
to whom then will ye liken me , or shall I be equal ? saith the Holy One .
keep silence before me , O islands ; and let the people renew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment .
behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
fear not , thou worm Jacob , and ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , saith the LORD , and thy redeemer , the Holy One of Israel .
behold , I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth : thou shalt thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as chaff .
thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the potter treadeth clay .
for I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
a bruised reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
he shall not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isles shall wait for his law .
I the LORD have called thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles ;
I am the LORD : that is my name : and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to graven images .
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the LORD shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the robbers ? did not the LORD , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
but now thus saith the LORD that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fear not : for I have redeemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
I have declared , and have saved , and I have shewed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , saith the LORD , that I am God .
thus saith the LORD , which maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ;
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
I , even I , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins .
thus saith the LORD that made thee , and formed thee from the womb , which will help thee ; Fear not , O Jacob , my servant ; and thou , Jesurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring :
thus saith the LORD the King of Israel , and his redeemer the LORD of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God .
he burneth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he eateth flesh ; he roasteth roast , and is satisfied : yea , he warmeth himself , and saith , Aha , I am warm , I have seen the fire :
remember these , O Jacob and Israel ; for thou art my servant : I have formed thee ; thou art my servant : O Israel , thou shalt not be forgotten of me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , thy transgressions , and , as a cloud , thy sins : return unto me ; for I have redeemed thee .
that frustrateth the tokens of the liars , and maketh diviners mad ; that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
that saith of Cyrus , He is my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure : even saying to Jerusalem , Thou shalt be built ; and to the temple , Thy foundation shall be laid .
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel .
I am the LORD , and there is none else , there is no God beside me : I girded thee , though thou hast not known me :
drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; I the LORD have created it .
thus saith the LORD , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker , Ask me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
I have made the earth , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captives , not for price nor reward , saith the LORD of hosts .
they shall be ashamed , and also confounded , all of them : they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth : I said not unto the seed of Jacob , Seek ye me in vain : I the LORD speak righteousness , I declare things that are right .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
surely , shall one say , in the LORD have I righteousness and strength : even to him shall men come ; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed .
they lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ,

therefore thus saith the LORD ; Ask ye now among the heathen , who hath heard such things : the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
thus saith the LORD , Go and get a potter 's earthen bottle , and take of the ancients of the people , and of the ancients of the priests ;
they have built also the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it into my mind :
thus will I do unto this place , saith the LORD , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as Tophet :
then came Jeremiah from Tophet , whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the LORD 's house ; and said to all the people ,
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . then said Jeremiah unto him , The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur , but Magor @-@ missabib .
but the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O LORD of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
and let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew , and repented not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the shouting at noontide ;
and I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
and unto this people thou shalt say , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
for I have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith the LORD : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
and say , Hear the word of the LORD , O king of Judah , that sittest upon the throne of David , thou , and thy servants , and thy people that enter in by these gates :
but if ye will not hear these words , I swear by myself , saith the LORD , that this house shall become a desolation .
and I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city ?
woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness , and his chambers by wrong ; that useth his neighbour 's service without wages , and giveth him not for his work ;
he judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well with him : was not this to know me ? saith the LORD .
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
O inhabitant of Lebanon , that makest thy nest in the cedars , how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee , the pain as of a woman in travail !
and I will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
thus saith the LORD , Write ye this man childless , a man that shall not prosper in his days : for no man of his seed shall prosper , sitting upon the throne of David , and ruling any more in Judah .
and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
and I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the LORD .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch , and a King shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
but , The LORD liveth , which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I had driven them ; and they shall dwell in their own land .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets ; Behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
for who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
the anger of the LORD shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
and as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , The burden of the LORD , I will even punish that man and his house .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , What hath the LORD answered ? and , What hath the LORD spoken ?
and the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of the LORD of hosts our God .
one basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
and I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places whither I shall drive them .
and I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers .
the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying ,
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
and go not after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
and this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the works of their own hands .
then took I the cup at the LORD 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the LORD had sent me :
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Ye shall certainly drink .
thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
he hath forsaken his covert , as the lion : for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD , saying ,
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD ; If ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath @-@ jearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him into Egypt .
and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king ; who slew him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD , saying ,
and command them to say unto their masters , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say unto your masters ;
I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
for they prophesy a lie unto you , to remove you far from your land ; and that I should drive you out , and ye should perish .
I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
hearken not unto them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live : Wherefore should this city be laid waste ?
for thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city ,
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be until the day that I visit them , saith the LORD ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the LORD hath truly sent him .
then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and brake it .
go and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus saith the LORD ; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood ; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron .
then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah ; The LORD hath not sent thee ; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD .
( after that Jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , and the carpenters , and the smiths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) saying ,
take ye wives , and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
and seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the LORD for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : I have not sent them , saith the LORD .
then shall ye call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and I will hearken unto you .
hear ye therefore the word of the LORD , all ye of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon :
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon , saying , The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ;
for therefore he sent unto us in Babylon , saying , This captivity is long : build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
for thus saith the LORD ; We have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
for it shall come to pass in that day , saith the LORD of hosts , that I will break his yoke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
for I will restore health unto thee , and I will heal thee of thy wounds , saith the LORD ; because they called thee an Outcast , saying , This is Zion , whom no man seeketh after .
at the same time , saith the LORD , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry , Arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God .
for thus saith the LORD ; Sing with gladness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , O LORD , save thy people , the remnant of Israel .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
if those ordinances depart from before me , saith the LORD , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
thus saith the LORD ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the LORD .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner .
for thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land .
Ah Lord GOD ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the Great , the Mighty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even unto this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day ;
and thou hast said unto me , O Lord GOD , Buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses ; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
behold , I am the LORD , the God of all flesh : is there any thing too hard for me ?
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the LORD .
and they have turned unto me the back , and not the face : though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction .
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them , and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The LORD our righteousness .
for thus saith the LORD ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
thus saith the LORD ; If ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ;
yet hear the word of the LORD , O Zedekiah king of Judah ; Thus saith the LORD of thee , Thou shalt not die by the sword :
this is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD , after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
go unto the house of the Rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the LORD , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habaziniah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father , which he commanded them ; but this people hath not hearkened unto me :
it may be they will present their supplication before the LORD , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people .
when Michaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD ,
then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
and they said unto him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears . so Baruch read it in their ears .
nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
but the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet : but the LORD hid them .
then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the LORD , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
and Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Pray now unto the LORD our God for us .
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
thus saith the LORD , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which shall take it .
then Zedekiah the king said , Behold , he is in your hand : for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
then the king commanded Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
and Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah , Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords . and Jeremiah did so .
so they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the LORD , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
and in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
but Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
so Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushasban , Rab @-@ saris , and Nergal @-@ sharezer , Rabmag , and all the king of Babylon 's princes ;
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
but I will deliver thee in that day , saith the LORD : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put thy trust in me , saith the LORD .
and the captain of the guard took Jeremiah , and said unto him , The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
now the LORD hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sinned against the LORD , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him , even with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
and they departed , and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
because of the Chaldeans : for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land .
then they said to Jeremiah , The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and I will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all Judah .
moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , Hear the word of the LORD , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt :
harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines .
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the LORD .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates .
Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gilead , and take balm , O virgin , the daughter of Egypt : in vain shalt thou use many medicines ; for thou shalt not be cured .
the nations have heard of thy shame , and thy cry hath filled the land : for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet , how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , saith the LORD , though it CANNOT be searched ; because they are more than the grasshoppers , and are innumerable .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines , and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth : for the LORD will spoil the Philistines , the remnant of the country of Caphtor .
O thou sword of the LORD , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy Scabbard , rest , and be still .
how can it be quiet , seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon , and against the sea shore ? there hath he appointed it .
against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Woe unto Nebo ! for it is spoiled : Kiriathaim is confounded and taken : Misgab is confounded and dismayed .
for in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
and the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the LORD hath spoken .
Moab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , saith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
all ye that are about him , bemoan him ; and all ye that know his name , say , How is the strong staff broken , and the beautiful rod !
thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
Moab is confounded ; for it is broken down : howl and cry ; and tell ye it in Arnon , that Moab is spoiled ,
the horn of Moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith the LORD .
we have heard the pride of Moab , ( he is exceeding proud ) his loftiness , and his arrogancy , and his pride , and the haughtiness of his heart .
therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir @-@ heres : because the riches that he hath gotten are perished .
for every head shall be bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands shall be cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
Kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men 's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
and afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon , saith the LORD .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for I have sworn by myself , saith the LORD , that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
also Edom shall be a desolation : every one that goeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof .
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea .
concerning Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad : for they have heard evil tidings : they are fainthearted ; there is sorrow on the sea ; it CANNOT be quiet .
Damascus is waxed feeble , and turneth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken her , as a woman in travail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the LORD of hosts .
concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite , thus saith the LORD ; Arise ye , go up to Kedar , and spoil the men of the east .
flee , get you far off , dwell deep , O ye inhabitants of Hazor , saith the LORD ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
and Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it .
the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against ELAM in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Behold , I will break the bow of ELAM , the chief of their might .
and I will set my throne in ELAM , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the LORD .
the word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet .
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
in those days , and in that time , saith the LORD , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together , going and weeping : they shall go , and seek the LORD their God .
because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate : every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
put yourselves in array against Babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against the LORD .
Israel is a scattered sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first the king of Assyria hath devoured him ; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones .
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : waste and utterly destroy after them , saith the LORD , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the LORD .
slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , saith the Lord GOD of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
and the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him .
a sword is upon the Chaldeans , saith the LORD , and upon the inhabitants of Babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of graven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
the king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands waxed feeble : anguish took hold of him , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
and will send unto Babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
for Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
the LORD hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God .
set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watchmen , prepare the ambushes : for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon .
the LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , Surely I will fill thee with men , as with caterpillers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name .
and I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , saith the LORD .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the LORD .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end ,
the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , shall the inhabitant of Zion say ; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea , shall Jerusalem say .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
and Babylon shall become heaps , a dwellingplace for dragons , an astonishment , and an hissing , without an inhabitant .
in their heat I will make their feasts , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the LORD .
then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for Babylon : for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north , saith the LORD .
ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the LORD afar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach : shame hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD 's house .
Wherefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will do judgment upon her graven images : and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
a sound of a cry cometh from Babylon , and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans :
because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do roar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered :
because the spoiler is come upon her , even upon Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , every one of their bows is broken : for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite .
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
and the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
but Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for Husbandmen .
the caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
so Nebuzar @-@ Adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath . thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
this is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty :
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors overtook her between the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feasts : all her gates are desolate : her priests sigh , her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
and from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become vile .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
for these things I weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water , because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy prevailed .
Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
the LORD is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the Gentiles : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD .
thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered thine iniquity , to turn away thy captivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
he hath hedged me about , that I CANNOT get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
for the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
they have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven : they pursued us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity : he will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; he will discover thy sins .
servants have ruled over us : there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand .
we Gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
as for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
and when the living creatures went , the wheels went by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and he said unto me , Son of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me : they and their fathers have transgressed against me , even unto this very day .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear : for they are most rebellious .
and when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
and he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel @-@ abib , that dwelt by the river of Chebar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and the hand of the LORD was there upon me ; and he said unto me , Arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the LORD stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even Jerusalem :
lie thou also upon thy left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity .
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an Hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; This is Jerusalem : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts , and they shall bereave thee ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee ; and I will bring the sword upon thee . I the LORD have spoken it .
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
yet will I leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the LORD , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
the time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn : for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
the sword is without , and the pestilence and the famine within : he that is in the field shall die with the sword ; and he that is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it , and defile it .
make a chain : for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancients .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of amber .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain .
then said he unto me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had digged in the wall , behold a door .
so I went in and saw ; and behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD 's house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , Go ye after him through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity :
and he said unto them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain : go ye forth . and they went forth , and slew in the city .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
and it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
every one had four faces apiece , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
this city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord GOD .
then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
and I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off .
therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord GOD .
ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD .
they have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , The LORD saith : and the LORD hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , The LORD saith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Repent , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the LORD have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , saith the Lord GOD .
if I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts :
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord GOD .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour them ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I set my face against them .
and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem ; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan ; thy father was an Amorite , and thy mother an Hittite .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of thy person , in the day that thou wast born .
I clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with Badgers ' skin , and I girded thee about with fine linen , and I covered thee with silk .
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and playedst the harlot because of thy renown , and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of thy garments thou didst take , and deckedst thy high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of thy whoredoms a small matter ,
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the Lord GOD ; )
thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours , great of flesh ; and hast increased thy whoredoms , to provoke me to anger .
thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
and I will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done , which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand .
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; As I live , surely mine oath that he hath despised , and my covenant that he hath broken , even it will I recompense upon his own head .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it .
what mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , saith the Lord GOD , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept my judgments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the Lord GOD .
if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth the like to any one of these things ,
hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination ,
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Lord GOD : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , O house of Israel ; Is not my way equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
and say , What is thy mother ? a lioness : she lay down among lions , she nourished her whelps among young lions .
and she brought up one of her whelps : it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the prey ; it devoured men .
and he went up and down among the lions , he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey , and devoured men .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood , planted by the waters : she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
but she was plucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
wilt thou judge them , son of man , wilt thou judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers :
and I gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness .
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all , that ye say , We will be as the heathen , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will I plead with you face to face .
like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I plead with you , saith the Lord GOD .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
son of man , set thy face toward Jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel ,
seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD ; Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished :
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for I the LORD have spoken it .
now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? yea , thou shalt shew her all her abominations .
those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mock thee , which art infamous and much vexed .
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood : and in thee they eat upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they commit lewdness .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' nakedness : in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution .
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood ; thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , saith the Lord GOD .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
son of man , say unto her , Thou art the land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter , seeing vanity , and divining lies unto them , saying , Thus saith the Lord GOD , when the LORD hath not spoken .
and I sought for a man among them , that should make up the hedge , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it : but I found none .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I recompensed upon their heads , saith the Lord GOD .
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
and the names of them were Aholah the elder , and Aholibah her sister : and they were mine , and they bare sons and daughters . thus were their names ; Samaria is Aholah , and Jerusalem Aholibah .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
and when her sister Aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms .
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
and the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
for she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the Paps of thy youth .
there , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister Samaria .
thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
the LORD said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah ? yea , declare unto them their abominations ;
for when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and , lo , thus have they done in the midst of mine house .
and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness , which put bracelets upon their hands , and beautiful crowns upon their heads .
and the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
and utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the bloody city ! I will even make the pile for fire great .
heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on thy shoes upon thy feet , and cover not thy lips , and eat not the bread of men .
that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast clapped thine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth @-@ jeshimoth , Baal @-@ meon , and Kiriathaim ,
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and revenged himself upon them ;
and I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord GOD .
and I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Tyrus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the Buckler against thee .
thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus ; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
I will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more : though thou be sought for , yet shalt thou never be found again , saith the Lord GOD .
they have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir : they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
they of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about , and the Gammadims were in thy towers : they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded in thy fairs .
Javan , tubal , and Meshech , they were thy merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market .
the men of Dedan were thy merchants ; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand : they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were thy merchants : they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith , and Pannag , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making , for the multitude of all riches ; in the wine of Helbon , and white wool .
the merchants of Sheba and Raamah , they were thy merchants : they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were thy merchants in all sorts of things , in blue clothes , and broidered work , and in chests of rich apparel , bound with cords , and made of cedar , among thy merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing .
and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and lament over thee , saying , What city is like Tyrus , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
behold , thou art wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from thee :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall defile thy brightness .
wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that slayeth thee .
thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee : thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more .
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel , nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them , that despised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
and all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel .
and the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the LORD : because he hath said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
and I will make Pathros desolate , and will set fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments in No .
and I will pour my fury upon Sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
and I will set fire in Egypt : sin shall have great pain , and No shall be rent asunder , and Noph shall have distresses daily .
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
I will also vex the hearts of many people , when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee .
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her : the daughters of the nations shall lament her : they shall lament for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , saith the Lord GOD .
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword , saith the Lord GOD .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
therefore , O thou son of man , speak unto the house of Israel ; Thus ye speak , saying , If our transgressions and our sins be upon us , and we pine away in them , how should we then live ?
again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
Wherefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Ye eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour 's wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
for I will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am the LORD , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , will both search my sheep , and seek them out .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will feed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord GOD .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them ; Behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
and I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord GOD .
and say unto it , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard them .
also , thou son of man , prophesy unto the mountains of Israel , and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the LORD :
but ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people of Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
and I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
but I had pity for mine holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen , whither they went .
for I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
and I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord GOD , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , O house of Israel .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
and they shall say , This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced , and are inhabited .
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the LORD have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry .
thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones ; Behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it , and performed it , saith the LORD .
and the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore .
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy bands , and many people with thee .
and thou shalt say , I will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; I will go to them that are at rest , that dwell safely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ,
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord GOD , that my fury shall come up in my face .
and I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the Lord GOD : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
thus will I magnify myself , and sanctify myself ; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations , and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
and I will send a fire on Magog , and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
yea , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord GOD .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the Lord GOD .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
and every little chamber was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
and the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
and there were narrow windows to the little chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the arches : and windows were round about inward : and upon each post were palm trees .
then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
and their windows , and their arches , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof were before them .
and the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits .
and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and there was a gate in the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and he said unto me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
then went he inward , and measured the post of the door , two cubits ; and the door , six cubits ; and the breadth of the door , seven cubits .
so he measured the length thereof , twenty cubits ; and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said unto me , This is the most holy place .
after he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the building .
and the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cubits .
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the utter court .
and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one entereth into them .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it round about .
he measured the east side with the measuring reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
he measured it by the four sides : it had a wall round about , five hundred reeds long , and five hundred broad , to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they did cleanse it with the bullock .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD : and I fell upon my face .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance : I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Let it suffice you , O princes of Israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice , take away your exactions from my people , saith the Lord GOD .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary :
in the first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and an Hin of oil for an ephah .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ancles .
again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; This shall be the border , whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph shall have two portions .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of Hethlon , as men go to Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazar @-@ hatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
and the border from the sea shall be Hazar @-@ enan , the border of Damascus , and the north northward , and the border of Hamath . and this is the north side .
and the east side ye shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
the west side also shall be the great sea from the border , till a man come over against Hamath . this is the west side .
and by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Asher .
and by the border of Asher , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for Naphtali .
and by the border of Naphtali , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Manasseh .
and by the border of Manasseh , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Ephraim .
and by the border of Ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for Reuben .
and by the border of Reuben , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Judah .
it shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok ; which have kept my charge , which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
and this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites .
and over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
and by the border of Simeon , from the east side unto the west side , Issachar a portion .
and by the border of Issachar , from the east side unto the west side , Zebulun a portion .
and by the border of Zebulun , from the east side unto the west side , Gad a portion .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their portions , saith the Lord GOD .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates northward ; one gate of Reuben , one gate of Judah , one gate of Levi .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Simeon , one gate of Issachar , one gate of Zebulun .
it was round about eighteen thousand measures : and the name of the city from that day shall be , The LORD is there .
then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack , O king , live for ever : tell thy servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon :
he answered and said to Arioch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so hasty from the king ? then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded CANNOT the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . thy dream , and the visions of thy head upon thy bed , are these ;
as for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him .
that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up :
then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego . then they brought these men before the king .
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , answered and said to the king , O Nebuchadnezzar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
if it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of thine hand , O king .
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego .
and these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
he answered and said , Lo , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation :
Wherefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
the king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
then the king 's countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
I have even heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
O thou king , the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom , and majesty , and glory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not .
then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . now the king spake and said unto Daniel , Thy God whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
therefore the he goat waxed very great : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised , and prospered .
and I heard a man 's voice between the banks of Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
and he said , Behold , I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shall be .
and his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus , of the seed of the Medes , which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans ;
in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet , that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem .
and I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and supplication , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes :
therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive ; O Lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , O my God : for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
and whiles I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth , and I am come to shew thee ; for thou art greatly beloved : therefore understand the matter , and consider the vision .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods , with their princes , and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
and both these kings ' hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
now when they shall fall , they shall be holpen with a little help : but many shall cleave to them with flatteries .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and one said to the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
but go thou thy way till the end be : for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days .
plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
I will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast days , her new moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn feasts .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the LORD .
and I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
afterward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the LORD their God , and David their king ; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days .
hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
by swearing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills , under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and your spouses shall commit adultery .
I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O Ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and Israel is defiled .
they have dealt treacherously against the LORD : for they have begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their portions .
the princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
they are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough , until it be leavened .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their congregation hath heard .
they return , but not to the most High : they are like a deceitful bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt .
set the trumpet to thy mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD , because they have transgressed my covenant , and trespassed against my law .
yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eat it ; but the LORD accepteth them not ; now will he remember their iniquity , and visit their sins : they shall return to Egypt .
for Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
they shall not dwell in the LORD 's land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria .
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
the watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the prophet is a snare of a Fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
all their wickedness is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their princes are revolters .
Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
my God will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him : and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
it is in my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth @-@ Arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
and the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
and my people are bent to backsliding from me : though they called them to the most High , none at all would exalt him .
they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the LORD .
Ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lies and desolation ; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
he took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God :
and I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him .
therefore I will be unto them as a lion : as a leopard by the way will I observe them :
I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .
Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
he hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
be ye ashamed , O ye Husbandmen ; howl , O ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley ; because the harvest of the field is perished .
sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God , and cry unto the LORD ,
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
O LORD , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
a fire devoureth before them ; and behind them a flame burneth : the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape them .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
therefore also now , saith the LORD , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning :
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
who knoweth if he will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind him ; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God ?
and the floors shall be full of wheat , and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil .
and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the LORD your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions :
and I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come .
proclaim ye this among the Gentiles ; Prepare war , wake up the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up :
let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about .
put ye in the sickle , for the harvest is ripe : come , get you down ; for the press is full , the fats overflow ; for their wickedness is great .
Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
and he said , The LORD will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of Carmel shall wither .
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to Edom :
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall devour the palaces thereof :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Tyrus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly covenant :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Moab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime :
thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
and I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazarites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? saith the LORD .
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith the LORD .
hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the LORD hath not done it ?
and I will smite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith the LORD .
hear this word , ye kine of Bashan , that are in the mountain of Samaria , which oppress the poor , which crush the needy , which say to their masters , Bring , and let us drink .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
for thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel , Seek ye me , and ye shall live :
but seek not Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal , and pass not to Beer @-@ sheba : for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and Bethel shall come to nought .
that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong , so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress .
for I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
shall not the day of the LORD be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols .
but ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , saith the LORD , whose name is The God of hosts .
ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that lie upon beds of ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
the Lord GOD hath sworn by himself , saith the LORD the God of hosts , I abhor the excellency of Jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , behold , the LORD commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me : and , behold , the Lord GOD called to contend by fire , and it devoured the great deep , and did eat up a part .
then said I , O Lord GOD , cease , I beseech thee : by whom shall Jacob arise ? for he is small .
thus he shewed me : and , behold , the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline , with a plumbline in his hand .
then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
also Amaziah said unto Amos , O thou seer , go , flee thee away into the land of Judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD : thou sayest , Prophesy not against Israel , and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac .
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , saith the Lord GOD : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord GOD , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD :
they that swear by the sin of Samaria , and say , Thy god , O Dan , liveth ; and , The manner of Beer @-@ sheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
and though they go into captivity before their enemies , thence will I command the sword , and it shall slay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
that they may possess the remnant of Edom , and of all the heathen , which are called by my name , saith the LORD that doeth this .
behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that the Plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the Treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
and I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them , saith the LORD thy God .
shall I not in that day , saith the LORD , even destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mount of Esau ?
for the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon thine own head .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau ; and they of the plain the Philistines : and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim , and the fields of Samaria : and Benjamin shall possess Gilead .
and saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau ; and the kingdom shall be the LORD 's .
and they said every one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
then said they unto him , What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous .
so they took up Jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , O LORD my God .
so the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
and the LORD God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
and God said to Jonah , doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? and he said , I do well to be angry , even unto death .
then said the LORD , Thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Saphir , having thy shame naked : the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @-@ ezel ; he shall receive of you his standing .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good : but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem .
yet will I bring an heir unto thee , O inhabitant of Mareshah : he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel .
woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the LORD straitened ? are these his doings ? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the LORD , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever .
but they know not the thoughts of the LORD , neither understand they his counsel : for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD , in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
and I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen , such as they have not heard .
hear ye now what the LORD saith ; Arise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear thy voice .
hear ye , O mountains , the LORD 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth : for the LORD hath a controversy with his people , and he will plead with Israel .
O my people , what have I done unto thee ? and wherein have I wearied thee ? testify against me .
wherewith shall I come before the LORD , and bow myself before the high God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves of a year old ?
the LORD 's voice crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that is abominable ?
thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
therefore I will look unto the LORD ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
in that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things .
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
who is a God like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? he retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy .
thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob , and the mercy to Abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
God is jealous , and the LORD revengeth ; the LORD revengeth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth wrath for his enemies .
he rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers : Bashan languisheth , and Carmel , and the flower of Lebanon languisheth .
the mountains quake at him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at his presence , yea , the world , and all that dwell therein .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
what do ye imagine against the LORD ? he will make an utter end : affliction shall not rise up the second time .
for while they be folden together as thorns , and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry .
thus saith the LORD : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more .
for the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel : for the emptiers have emptied them out , and marred their vine branches .
the chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightnings .
he shall recount his worthies : they shall stumble in their walk ; they shall make hast to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepared .
and Huzzab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up , and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves , tabering upon their breasts .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feedingplace of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whelp , and none made them afraid ?
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with ravin .
because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot , the mistress of witchcrafts , that selleth nations through her whoredoms , and families through her witchcrafts .
behold , I am against thee , saith the LORD of hosts ; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face , and I will shew the nations thy nakedness , and the kingdoms thy shame .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , Nineveh is laid waste : who will bemoan her ? whence shall I seek comforters for thee ?
art thou better than populous No , that was situate among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , thy people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies : the fire shall devour thy bars .
why dost thou shew me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ? for spoiling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up strife and contention .
for , lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
and they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , imputing this his power unto his god .
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am reproved .
and the LORD answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
behold , is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , that puttest thy bottle to him , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
thou art filled with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy foreskin be uncovered : the cup of the LORD 's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory .
O LORD , I have heard thy speech , and was afraid : O LORD , revive thy work in the midst of the years , in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy .
God came from Teman , and the Holy One from mount Paran . Selah . his glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
and his brightness was as the light ; he had horns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages : they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me : their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly .
the word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hizkiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops ; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD , and that swear by Malcham ;
in the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill their masters ' houses with violence and deceit .
howl , ye inhabitants of Maktesh , for all the merchant people are cut down ; all they that bear silver are cut off .
the great day of the LORD is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the LORD : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
and I will bring distress upon men , that they shall walk like blind men , because they have sinned against the LORD : and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as the dung .
before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the chaff , before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you , before the day of the LORD 's anger come upon you .
seek ye the LORD , all ye meek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD 's anger .
I have heard the reproach of Moab , and the revilings of the children of Ammon , whereby they have reproached my people , and magnified themselves against their border .
this shall they have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts .
I have cut off the nations : their towers are desolate ; I made their streets waste , that none passeth by : their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is none inhabitant .
from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
sing , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O Israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem .
the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , saying , This people say , The time is not come , the time that the LORD 's house should be built .
go up to the mountain , and bring wood , and build the house ; and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , saith the LORD .
then spake Haggai the LORD 's messenger in the LORD 's message unto the people , saying , I am with you , saith the LORD .
and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with glory , saith the LORD of hosts .
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former , saith the LORD of hosts : and in this place will I give peace , saith the LORD of hosts .
then answered Haggai , and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith the LORD ; and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is unclean .
and now , I pray you , consider from this day and upward , from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD :
since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith the LORD .
and again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
therefore say thou unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Turn ye unto me , saith the LORD of hosts , and I will turn unto you , saith the LORD of hosts .
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said , These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
so the angel that communed with me said unto me , Cry thou , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy .
and I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease : for I was but a little displeased , and they helped forward the affliction .
and I said unto the angel that talked with me , What be these ? and he answered me , These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem .
then said I , whither goest thou ? and he said unto me , To measure Jerusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
and said unto him , Run , speak to this young man , saying , Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein :
for thus saith the LORD of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
for , behold , I will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me .
and many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
be silent , O all flesh , before the LORD : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation .
and the LORD said unto Satan , The LORD rebuke thee , O Satan ; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee : is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ?
hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH .
and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me , saying , What are these , my lord ?
then he answered and spake unto me , saying , This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the LORD of hosts .
the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you .
then answered I , and said unto him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
and I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
then said he , These are the two anointed ones , that stand by the LORD of the whole earth .
and he said unto me , What seest thou ? and I answered , I see a flying roll ; the length thereof is twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof ten cubits .
then the angel that talked with me went forth , and said unto me , Lift up now thine eyes , and see what is this that goeth forth .
and I said , What is it ? and he said , This is an ephah that goeth forth . he said moreover , This is their resemblance through all the earth .
and he said , This is wickedness . and he cast it into the midst of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four chariots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
then cried he upon me , and spake unto me , saying , Behold , these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country .
take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah ;
thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , saying , Execute true judgment , and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother :
thus saith the LORD ; I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain .
thus saith the LORD of hosts ; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof .
and I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness .
for thus saith the LORD of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith the LORD of hosts , and I repented not :
so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah : fear ye not .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD , and to seek the LORD of hosts : I will go also .
and Tyrus did build herself a strong hold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
behold , the Lord will cast her out , and he will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire .
Ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and Ekron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
and a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
when I have bent Judah for me , filled the bow with Ephraim , and raised up thy sons , O Zion , against thy sons , O Greece , and made thee as the sword of a mighty man .
and the LORD shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds of the south .
and the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an ensign upon his land .
for how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the maids .
and they shall be as mighty men , which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the LORD is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
and they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : yea , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Labanon ; and place shall not be found for them .
and I will strengthen them in the LORD ; and they shall walk up and down in his name , saith the LORD .
whose possessors slay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , Blessed be the LORD ; for I am rich : and their own shepherds pity them not .
and I took my staff , even Beauty , and cut it assunder , that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD .
behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem .
and the governors of Judah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God .
in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem , as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
and the land shall mourn , every family apart ; the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
the family of the house of Levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of Shimei apart , and their wives apart ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
and one shall say unto him , What are these wounds in thine hands ? then he shall answer , Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , saith the LORD , two parts therein shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left therein .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD ; and the pots in the LORD 's house shall be like the bowl 's before the altar .
and now , I pray you , beseech God that he will be gracious unto us : this hath been by your means : will he regard your persons ? saith the LORD of hosts .
and ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant might be with Levi , saith the LORD of hosts .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth : for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi , saith the LORD of hosts .
Judah hath dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
the LORD will cut off the man that doeth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tabernacles of Jacob , and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts .
and this have ye done again , covering the altar of the LORD with tears , with weeping , and with crying out , insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more , or receiveth it with good will at your hand .
for the LORD , the God of Israel , saith that he hateth putting away : for one covereth violence with his garment , saith the LORD of hosts : therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treacherously .
but who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like Fullers ' soap :
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver : and he shall purify the sons of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness .
your words have been stout against me , saith the LORD . yet ye say , What have we spoken so much against thee ?
ye have said , It is vain to serve God : and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance , and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts ?
then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another : and the LORD hearkened , and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD , and that thought upon his name .
and they shall be mine , saith the LORD of hosts , in that day when I make up my jewels ; and I will spare them , as a man spareth his own son that serveth him .
then shall ye return , and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not .
but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as calves of the stall .
and ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this , saith the LORD of hosts .
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins .
then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
and thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
and he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
when he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
and was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
in Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
but when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
and he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
and Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffered him .
and Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
and when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
but he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
for I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
and if thy right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
but I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloke also .
give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
but when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen .
moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
no man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye CANNOT serve God and mammon .
behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . are ye not much better than they ?
and why take ye thought for raiment ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
and , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . and immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
and Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
when Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
and Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
and Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
and he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
and , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
for whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
but when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
but when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
but go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
and when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
he said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . and they laughed him to scorn .
and when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou Son of David , have mercy on us .
and when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? they said unto him , Yea , Lord .
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
these twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
what I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
he that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
and as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
at that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
but when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles .
a bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
but if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
but I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
but he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
for whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
and he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
he answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
but he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
the enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
and when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
and said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
for Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
when Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
and Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
but when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
for God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
but ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
and honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
but he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
and great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
and his disciples say unto him , whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
he answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas . and he left them , and departed .
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
but he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
for what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
while he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
and as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen again from the dead .
but I say unto you , That Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
and while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . and they were exceeding sorry .
at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
and said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
and if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
but the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
so when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
and his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
and it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ;
the Pharisees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
and he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
and said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
they say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
he saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
and I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
his disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
but he said unto them , All men CANNOT receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
but Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
the young man saith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
they say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
so when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
and he said unto her , What wilt thou ? she saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
and Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
and when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then sent Jesus two disciples ,
and if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
and said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
and Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
but when the Husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
they say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other Husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
but when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
and no man was able to answer him a word , neither Durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
and Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
for as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark ,
but know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
and at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
and while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
his lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
and I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
for I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
and said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
and he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
the Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
and as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
and , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smote off his ear .
then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
but all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
and said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
and when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
and after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
when the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood . and they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that .
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
and Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? and Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
the governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? they said , Barabbas .
Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? they all say unto him , Let him be crucified .
and the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
and after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
and when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
and saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . if thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
he saved others ; himself he CANNOT save . if he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
he trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elias .
and straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
and Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . Amen .
and there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
and John was clothed with camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
and preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
and it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
and there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
and he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
and saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
and when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
but Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
and there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
and saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
when Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
and as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . and he arose and followed him .
and it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
when Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they CANNOT fast .
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
and he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
and he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
for he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
and unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
and James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder :
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
and he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ?
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
and some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
and other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
and these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
and he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
and he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
and he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
and he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . and the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
while he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ?
as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
and straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great astonishment .
but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
and king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
for Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her .
for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
and when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
and he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
and Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
and when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
he answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . and they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
and he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
then came together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from Jerusalem .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
for laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
and he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it CANNOT defile him ;
and from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
the woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
and were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
and if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
and they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
and the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
and when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? and they said , Seven .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? and Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
and he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
and he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
and after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
and Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
but I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
and when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
and straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
when Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
and the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
but Jesus said , forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
and if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
and they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
and he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
and Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
but Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
and they said unto him , We can . and Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
and they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
and Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
and when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
and Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
and he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
and when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
and they answered and said unto Jesus , We CANNOT tell . and Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
but those Husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and they brought it . and he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? and they said unto him , Caesar 's .
he is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
and one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
and the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . and no man after that Durst ask him any question .
and Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David ?
for David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
and he said unto them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
and Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
and as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains :
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
and except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
and then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
for false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
she hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
and the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
and wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
and he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
the Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
and they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
and he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
and he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
and he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
and as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
and Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
we heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
but he held his peace , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
and some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
and when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
and the second time the cock crew . and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept .
and Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? and he answering said unto him , Thou sayest it .
and there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
but Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
and so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
and when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
and when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
Joseph of Arimathaea , and honourable counseller , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
and he saith unto them , Be not affrighted : ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
and she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
and these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
they shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
and they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen .
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
but the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
and Zacharias said unto the angel , whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary .
and the angel came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
and , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS .
and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
and , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
and she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the Lord was with him .
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
and Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
and she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
and , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
and he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
and Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
but they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? and he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
and as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
and Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
and the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
and Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
and the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
and he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
and all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . and they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ?
but unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
and they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
and devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
and Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
when Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
and after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Follow me .
and they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
and certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
and Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
and it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
but he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . and he arose and stood forth .
then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
and when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
and he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
and a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
and when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
and it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
and when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
and he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . and he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
and there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
and when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
and all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
and the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . and he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
a sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . and when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
and that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
and it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
and he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
but as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
and they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
and he said unto them , Where is your faith ? and they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . and he suffered them .
and , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
and he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
while he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
and of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
and the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
but he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . and they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
and it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
but I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . but while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and Jesus said unto him , foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
but into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
and he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
and Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
and went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
but Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
but one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
and it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples .
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
if thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
and as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
and he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye Lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
and as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
and whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven .
and when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
and he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
and he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
but God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
if then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
and this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
but and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
but I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
he spake also this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
and when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
the Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
and ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? and he said unto them ,
then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
but he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
the same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
and he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
and Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
and answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
and they all with one consent began to make excuse . the first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
and another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . and he divided unto them his living .
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
and when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
and when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
but the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
and he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
and he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
and he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I CANNOT dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
so he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
and he said , An hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? and he said , An hundred measures of wheat . and he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
and I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
no servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye CANNOT serve God and mammon .
and he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
there was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come !
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
but which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
and fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
and he said unto him , Arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
for as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
and he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake ,
and they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
and he cried , saying , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
and when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
and Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
and another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
for I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
and he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and he taught daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
and spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to Husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a servant to the Husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the Husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
but when the Husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
so they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
he shall come and destroy these Husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . and when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
and they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
and they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly :
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
and the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
and Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
and David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
as for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and PESTILENCES ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
for I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
for I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
and truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
and the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
for I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
and he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? and he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
and they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
and they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
and all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
and the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
and returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
it was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
but they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . and he went in to tarry with them .
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
and , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
the same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
and the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
and this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
and they asked him , What then ? art thou Elias ? and he saith , I am not . art thou that prophet ? and he answered , No .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
and they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
and I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? they said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
he first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
and he brought him to Jesus . and when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , Believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
and he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
and there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . and they filled them up to the brim .
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
and said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house an house of merchandise .
then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he CANNOT see the kingdom of God .
Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ?
Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he CANNOT enter into the kingdom of God .
the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him .
then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
but the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
the woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
and he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
and many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
when Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
he answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
and he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
and the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
when Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
there is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
and Jesus said , Make the men sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
and Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
and this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
as the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
it is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
the Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
when Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
these words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
and he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? and Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
and he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
they answered him , We be Abraham 's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
they answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
ye do the deeds of your father . then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
and his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
and said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
he answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
the man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
and Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
and Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
the thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
but he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
no man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this commandment have I received of my Father .
then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? if thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
my Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand .
say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
but if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
when Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
she saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
there they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
the people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him .
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
the people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
he hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
and if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
and supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ;
Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
so after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
when Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
for some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
in my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
and I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world CANNOT receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
but that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . arise , let us go hence .
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
these things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
but when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
he shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
all things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . verily , verily , I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
these things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world .
these words spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee :
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
and I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
they answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . and Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
and led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
and Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? he saith , I am not .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
and when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
and Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . they said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? he denied it , and said , I am not .
one of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? and when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
but ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . and Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
and from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar 's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
when Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
and it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
but they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? the chief priest answered , We have no king but Caesar .
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :
and Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , JESUS OF Nazareth THE KING OF THE JEWS .
now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
when Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
and he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
and there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
and he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
and when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
and after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
then saith he to Thomas , reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . they say unto him , We also go with thee . they went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God :
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
and he said unto them , It is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his own power .
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
and it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
and they prayed , and said , Thou , Lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship , from which Judas by transgression fell , that he might go to his own place .
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speak Galilaeans ?
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Ye men of Judaea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
for these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
and I will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
for David speaketh concerning him , I foresaw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
for David is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly , that God hath made that same Jesus , whom ye have crucified , both Lord and Christ .
then Peter said unto them , Repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost .
then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart ,
praising God , and having favour with all the people . and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength .
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
and as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem ; and we CANNOT deny it .
but Peter and John answered and said unto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God , judge ye .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
for of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
by stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
but Peter said , Ananias , why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
saying , The prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
and when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
saying , Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man 's blood upon us .
and they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
and in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
Wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
and he said , Men , brethren , and fathers , hearken ; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he dwelt in Charran ,
then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and dwelt in Charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
and were carried over into Sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem .
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
he brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us :
to whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt ,
saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
yea , ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles , whom God drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of David ;
but he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
and said , Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God .
and cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet , whose name was Saul .
as for Saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
but there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is the great power of God .
and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Ghost :
and when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money ,
then answered Simon , and said , Pray ye to the Lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip , saying , Arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza , which is desert .
and he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? and he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
and Saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest ,
and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
and he said , Who art thou , Lord ? and the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
and he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? and the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias . and he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
but the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles , and kings , and the children of Israel :
and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
and there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
but Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him , and saying unto him , Cornelius .
and when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? and he said unto him , Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God .
and when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
on the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , Behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and the morrow after they entered into Caesarea . and Cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
and as Peter was coming in , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
therefore came I unto you without gainsaying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
and Cornelius said , Four days ago I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
and said , Cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
the word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ;
then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life .
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
and some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , which , when they were come to Antioch , spake unto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Jesus .
for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the Lord .
and there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea :
which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him .
and when Herod would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
and the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , and bind on thy sandals . and so he did . and he saith unto him , Cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
and he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
so they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
and when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius PAULUS , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
and said , O full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
then Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , Men of Israel , and ye that fear God , give audience .
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until Samuel the prophet .
and afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of CIS , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
of this man 's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour , Jesus :
men and brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and whosoever among you feareth God , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
and by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for I work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
and when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
they were ware of it , and fled unto Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
said with a loud voice , Stand upright on thy feet . and he leaped and walked .
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
confirming the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
and thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
that the residue of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the Lord , who doeth all these things .
and they wrote letters by them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia :
forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
for it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
and the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ;
now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia , and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
after they were come to Mysia , they assayed to go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
and a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us .
and from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
and when she was baptized , and her household , she besought us , saying , If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and abide there . and she constrained us .
the same followed Paul and us , and cried , saying , These men are the servants of the most high God , which shew unto us the way of salvation .
and this did she many days . but Paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas ,
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in God with all his house .
and they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
and Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
opening and alleging , that Christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom I preach unto you , is Christ .
whom Jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , one Jesus .
and when they had taken security of Jason , and of the other , they let them go .
therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
and then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
and they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
then Paul stood in the midst of Mars ' hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man 's device .
and the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked : and others said , We will hear thee again of this matter .
and because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
and when they opposed themselves , and blasphemed , he shook his raiment , and said unto them , Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean : from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles .
and he departed thence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named Justus , one that worshipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
and Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
and when Paul was now about to open his mouth , Gallio said unto the Jews , If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness , O ye Jews , reason would that I should bear with you :
then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and Gallio cared for none of those things .
and he came to Ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
and when he had landed at Caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to Antioch .
and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
and when he was disposed to pass into Achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
and it came to pass , that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus : and finding certain disciples ,
he said unto them , Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him , We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost .
but when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
then certain of the vagabond Jews , Exorcists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth .
and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
but when they knew that he was a Jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
and there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timotheus ; and of Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .
for Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
I have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , It is more blessed to give than to receive .
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him unto the ship .
and when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry .
as touching the Gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
( for they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
and as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
and some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
and as Paul was to be led into the castle , he said unto the chief captain , May I speak unto thee ? who said , canst thou speak Greek ?
art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
men , brethren , and fathers , hear ye my defence which I make now unto you .
( and when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
and one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there ,
came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , Brother Saul , receive thy sight . and the same hour I looked up upon him .
and he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that Just One , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the Lord .
and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
and as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with thongs , Paul said unto the centurion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and uncondemned ?
when the centurion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , Take heed what thou doest : for this man is a Roman .
and the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
and the night following the Lord stood by him , and said , Be of good cheer , Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at Rome .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul .
and when Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
then Paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , Bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
and he said , The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council , as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
and provide them beasts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe unto Felix the governor .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
and after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named Tertullus , who informed the governor against Paul .
we accept it always , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thankfulness .
notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
but this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
and have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
and he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
and after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
and as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come Felix trembled , and answered , Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : Wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
but after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
but Festus , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
then said Paul , I stand at Caesar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , Hast thou appealed unto Caesar ? unto Caesar shalt thou go .
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
and because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . Wherefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write .
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews :
especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . for which hope 's sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
that Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the Gentiles .
and as he thus spake for himself , Festus said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad .
then said Agrippa unto Festus , This man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto Caesar .
and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
and entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
and when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
and when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
and sounded , and found it twenty Fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen Fathoms .
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
and while the day was coming on , Paul besought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
but the centurion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
and the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a viper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously .
and it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
and from thence we fetched a compass , and came to Rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to Puteoli :
and from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum , and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
saying , Go unto this people , and say , Hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and not perceive :
and when he had said these words , the Jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
to all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
for I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
and thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
for circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
and not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose damnation is just .
their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
to declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus .
is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Gentiles ? yes , of the Gentiles also :
cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
how was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
and being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
for if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
and not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
for if by one man 's offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
for as by one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
God forbid . how shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
for when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
but I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
O wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord . so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God ; but with the flesh the law of sin .
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
and if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint @-@ heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
for the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which CANNOT be uttered .
for whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
what shall we then say to these things ? if God be for us , who can be against us ?
nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I say the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost ,
nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved :
Wherefore ? because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . for they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
but what saith it ? the word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
but I say , Have they not heard ? yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
but I say , Did not Israel know ? first Moses saith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
I say then , Hath God cast away his people ? God forbid . for I also am an Israelite , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
Lord , they have killed thy prophets , and digged down thine altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
but what saith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
I say then , Have they stumbled that they should fall ? God forbid : but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles , for to provoke them to jealousy .
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . be not highminded , but fear :
behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
and they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for God is able to Graff them in again .
and so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob :
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
and be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord .
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . for there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
for for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
who art thou that judgest another man 's servant ? to his own master he standeth or falleth . yea , he shall be Holden up : for God is able to make him stand .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
but why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
for meat destroy not the work of God . all things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
for even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
and I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
for I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
that ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen , and my fellowprisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
but now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
but unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
and I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
but as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
for who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he may instruct him ? but we have the mind of Christ .
for we are labourers together with God : ye are God 's husbandry , ye are God 's building .
if any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
let no man deceive himself . if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . for it is written , He taketh the wise in their own craftiness .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
for I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
for though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
what will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
and ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
for I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
what ? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ? for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
for I would that all men were even as I myself . but every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
and unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
but if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
for what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
but as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . and so ordain I in all churches .
now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
but this I say , brethren , the time is short : it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ;
and they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
and this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
but meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
if I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? for our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
if others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
for though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
for if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
what is my reward then ? verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
now all these things happened unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
all things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man 's conscience ?
now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
but if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
if the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? if the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
and the eye CANNOT say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
that there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .
and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
when I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
but if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
how is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , everyone of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . let all things be done unto edifying .
if any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
after that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
but every man in his own order : Christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that are Christ 's at his coming .
for he hath put all things under his feet . but when he saith , all things are put under him , it is manifest that he is excepted , which did put all things under him .
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we die .
but some man will say , How are the dead raised up ? and with what body do they come ?
and that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
all flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
it is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
now I will come unto you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
and it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go .
as touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
the churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
and to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
for if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ 's gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
to the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
for if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
and not as Moses , which put a Vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
but their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same Vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which Vail is done away in Christ .
but we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
for we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
we having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
for all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God .
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
for the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
for he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the Lord , and touch not the unclean thing ; and I will receive you ,
great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
for though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
and herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
and we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
whether any do inquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be inquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent am bold toward you :
but I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
( for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
but we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
but though I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things .
are they Hebrews ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
and I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I CANNOT tell : God knoweth ; )
of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
for though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
finally , brethren , farewell . be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
but though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
for before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
but if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
and this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , CANNOT disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
Wherefore then serveth the law ? it was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;
they zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
for it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is agar .
nevertheless what saith the scripture ? cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
so then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
and I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
this I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh .
for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye CANNOT do the things that ye would .
now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; Adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
and let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
but God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ :
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
in whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself :
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power ,
and hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church ,
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
for we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
Wherefore remember , that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands ;
that at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
for he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward :
Wherefore he saith , When he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
and he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
and grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
for this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ;
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul and Timotheus , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
what then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
but if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
for I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
but made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
that ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
but ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
though I might also have confidence in the flesh . if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
and be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
therefore , my brethren dearly beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand fast in the Lord , my dearly beloved .
those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
but I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
we give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
which is come unto you , as it is in all the world ; and bringeth forth fruit , as it doth also in you , since the day ye heard of it , and knew the grace of God in truth :
and you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles ; which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
for though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to ordinances ,
if ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
but now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ;
forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
all my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord :
with Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , saluteth you , always labouring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
for I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
and say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfil it .
and ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Ghost :
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God @-@ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
but even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
so being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
for ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
and sent Timotheus , our brother , and minister of God , and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
for this cause , when I could no longer forbear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
furthermore then we beseech you , brethren , and exhort you by the Lord Jesus , that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God , so ye would abound more and more .
for this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
but I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
but let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
and we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
see that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
now we beseech you , brethren , by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and by our gathering together unto him ,
that ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of Christ is at hand .
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God , or that is worshipped ; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
but we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth :
therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
as I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
for whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
this is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
for kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
but I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
a bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
and let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils ;
forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
for every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving :
neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
but if any widow have children or nephews , let them learn first to shew piety at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God .
now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
if any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
for the scripture saith , Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn . and , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
some men 's sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
I give thee charge in the sight of God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession ;
I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
this thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
the Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
and if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
wherein I suffer trouble , as an evil doer , even unto bonds ; but the word of God is not bound .
therefore I endure all things for the elect 's sakes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
if a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
and the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
all scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
but watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry .
the cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
but a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ;
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Ghost ;
that being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
when I shall send Artemas unto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis : for I have determined there to winter .
Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
yet for love 's sake I rather beseech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
and again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
and of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
and , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
but to which of the angels said he at any time , Sit on my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
but one in a certain place testified , saying , What is man , that thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man , that thou visitest him ?
thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands :
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
and Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , They do alway err in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
for we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
for some , when they had heard , did provoke : Howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
but with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
as he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
for this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
for the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
for finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
for if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
for a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
but call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
but now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
they were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
( of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
and the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
whose voice then shook the earth : but now he hath promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven .
let your conversation be without covetousness ; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee .
so that we may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
for the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
but the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God CANNOT be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , Sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
for he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
and one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . for what is your life ? it is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
and if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man 's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever .
but the word of the Lord endureth for ever . and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
to whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
but and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
for Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
as every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
but let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters .
yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
the church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .
Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
for if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
but he that lacketh these things is blind , and CANNOT see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
and many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
for if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
but these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
having eyes full of adultery , and that CANNOT cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us @-@ ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
and account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
but grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . to him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
he that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
my little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
and whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
we are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
in this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
if a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
if we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
for the truth 's sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
and now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
for many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . this is a deceiver and an antichrist .
whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
for I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . he that doeth good is of God : but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
and the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , Durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
to execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
to the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . Amen .
the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . even so , Amen .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
and his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
and hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
but unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
and one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Juda , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
and the four beasts said , Amen . and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb .
and all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
saying , Amen : blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen .
and I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
and when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
and the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
the first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
and the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
and the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
and I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
these are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
and the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
and he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
and I looked , and , lo , a Lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their foreheads .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of Harpers harping with their harps :
and I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people ,
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
and I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
who shall not fear thee , O Lord , and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee ; for thy judgments are made manifest .
and after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
and the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
and I heard the angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials , and talked with me , saying unto me , Come hither ; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters :
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
and upon her forehead was a name written , MYSTERY , BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF harlots AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
these shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
and I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
and saying , Alas , alas , that great city , that was clothed in fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold , and precious stones , and pearls !
for in one hour so great riches is come to nought . and every shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood afar off ,
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia ; Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne , saying , Amen ; Alleluia .
and a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
and I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF Lords .
and I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away .
and he that sat upon the throne said , Behold , I make all things new . and he said unto me , Write : for these words are true and faithful .
he that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the bride , the Lamb 's wife .
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and shewed me that great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
and the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand furlongs . the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
and there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and he said unto me , These sayings are faithful and true : and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
and , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
