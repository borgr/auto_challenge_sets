 `` It is well I drew the curtain , '' thought I ; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would John Reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but Eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once --
 Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye , but seldom addressed me : since my illness , she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself , condemning me to take my meals alone , and pass all my time in the nursery , while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room .
 There are many others who have no friends , who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ? "
 It would be difficult to say : I could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet I had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
 Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England , and I said yes ; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to England , and now he is gone back again himself , and I never see him . "
 `` Was that Grace Poole ? and is she possessed with a devil ? '' thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself : I must go to Mrs. Fairfax .
 For herself , she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers , jump on and off the bedsteads , and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys .
 Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below ; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled , oaken chamber of the second storey : there she sat and sewed -- and probably laughed drearily to herself , -- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon .
 For myself , I had no need to make any change ; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom ; for a sanctum it was now become to me , -- `` a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble . ''
 `` She says , sir , that she 'll have no gentlemen ; they need not trouble themselves to come near her ; nor , '' he added , with difficulty suppressing a titter , `` any ladies either , except the young , and single . ''
 I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy , whose strange talk , voice , manner , had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream .
 `` Never fear -- I will take care of myself . ''
 So I addressed the housekeeper ; asked her to show me a room , told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two , had my trunk conveyed to my chamber , and followed it thither myself : I met Bessie on the landing .
 The communications were renewed from day to day : they always ran on the same theme -- herself , her loves , and woes .
 `` I will leave you by yourself , white dream , '' I said .
 The cloven halves were not broken from each other , for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below ; though community of vitality was destroyed -- the sap could flow no more : their great boughs on each side were dead , and next winter 's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth : as yet , however , they might be said to form one tree -- a ruin , but an entire ruin .
 He could not then hasten to England himself , to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen , but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage .
 Far from desiring to publish the connection , he became as anxious to conceal it as myself .
 The next day I observed you -- myself unseen -- for half-an- hour , while you played with Adele in the gallery .
 Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart , if you would : seized against your will , you will elude the grasp like an essence -- you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance .
 Moreover , she is a sweet girl -- rather thoughtless ; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her .
 It seems her career there was very honourable : from a pupil , she became a teacher , like yourself -- really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours -- she left it to be a governess : there , again , your fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester . "
 He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at present studying ; that , as he advanced , he was apt to forget the commencement ; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements , and so fix them thoroughly in his mind ; that his choice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters ; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three .
 All the house was still ; for I believe all , except St. John and myself , were now retired to rest .
 " Yes , indeed was he ; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below , and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself , and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell .
 ' Well ! ' thought Alice to herself , ' after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
 She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ' Which way ? Which way ? ' , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .
 Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
 ' Why , ' said the Dodo , ' the best way to explain it is to do it . ' ( And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . )
 ' I ca n't explain myself , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not myself , you see . '
 ' My name is Alice , so please your Majesty , ' said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , ' Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all .
 Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after-time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child-life , and the happy summer days .
 When he went for walks he talked to the servant , who , like himself , came from the country .
 When he saw that the rest were far behind he stopped to take breath , slowly rosined his bow , so that the strings should sound more shrilly , then set off again , by turns lowering and raising his neck , the better to mark time for himself .
 Then noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal , who yawned slowly , she softened , and comparing her to herself , spoke to her aloud as to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling .
 Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat , rearranged his cravat , and threw away the dirty gloves he was going to put on ; and this was not , as he fancied , for himself ; it was for herself , by a diffusion of egotism , of nervous irritation .
 She ordered dishes for herself , then she did not touch them ; one day drank only pure milk , the next cups of tea by the dozen .
 `` Moreover , '' said the druggist , `` the practice of medicine is not very hard work in our part of the world , for the state of our roads allows us the use of gigs , and generally , as the farmers are prosperous , they pay pretty well . We have , medically speaking , besides the ordinary cases of enteritis , bronchitis , bilious affections , etc . , now and then a few intermittent fevers at harvest-time ; but on the whole , little of a serious nature , nothing special to note , unless it be a great deal of scrofula , due , no doubt , to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our peasant dwellings . Ah ! you will find many prejudices to combat , Monsieur Bovary , much obstinacy of routine , with which all the efforts of your science will daily come into collision ; for people still have recourse to novenas , to relics , to the priest , rather than come straight to the doctor or the chemist . The climate , however , is not , truth to tell , bad , and we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish . The thermometer ( I have made some observations ) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade at the outside , which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum , or otherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit ( English scale ) , not more . And , as a matter of fact , we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of Argueil on the one side , from the west winds by the St. Jean range on the other ; and this heat , moreover , which , on account of the aqueous vapours given off by the river and the considerable number of cattle in the fields , which , as you know , exhale much ammonia , that is to say , nitrogen , hydrogen and oxygen ( no , nitrogen and hydrogen alone ) , and which sucking up into itself the humus from the ground , mixing together all those different emanations , unites them into a stack , so to say , and combining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere , when there is any , might in the long run , as in tropical countries , engender insalubrious miasmata - this heat , I say , finds itself perfectly tempered on the side whence it comes , or rather whence it should come - that is to say , the southern side - by the south-eastern winds , which , having cooled themselves passing over the Seine , reach us sometimes all at once like breezes from Russia . ''
 He had knocked about the world , he talked about Berlin , Vienna , and Strasbourg , of his soldier times , of the mistresses he had had , the grand luncheons of which he had partaken ; then he was amiable , and sometimes even , either on the stairs , or in the garden , would seize hold of her waist , crying , `` Charles , look out for yourself . ''
 The fire was out , the clock went on ticking , and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of all things while within herself was such tumult .
 Mind the cold ; take care of yourself ; look after yourself . "
 " Apply yourselves , above all , to the amelioration of the soil , to good manures , to the development of the equine , bovine , ovine , and porcine races .
 She asked him for some verses - some verses `` for herself , '' a `` love poem '' in honour of her .
 `` Do n't see them ; do n't go out ; think only of ourselves ; love me ! ''
 In fact someone had sent his mother a long anonymous letter to warn her that he was `` ruining himself with a married woman , '' and the good lady at once conjuring up the eternal bugbear of families , the vague pernicious creature , the siren , the monster , who dwells fantastically in depths of love , wrote to Lawyer Dubocage , his employer , who behaved perfectly in the affair . He kept him for three quarters of an hour trying to open his eyes , to warn him of the abyss into which he was falling . Such an intrigue would damage him later on , when he set up for himself . He implored him to break with her , and , if he would not make this sacrifice in his own interest , to do it at least for his , Dubocage 's sake .
 Everything , even herself , was now unbearable to her .
 The persons who , like ourselves , never cross the Place de Grève without casting a glance of pity and sympathy on that poor turret strangled between two hovels of the time of Louis XV . , can easily reconstruct in their minds the aggregate of edifices to which it belonged , and find again entire in it the ancient Gothic place of the fifteenth century .
 You form for yourselves a great idea of the thing .
 The new art takes the monument where it finds it , incrusts itself there , assimilates it to itself , develops it according to its fancy , and finishes it if it can .
 A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre − Dame .
 He took it upon himself to reply to the archdeacon 's question , − −
 At her death , at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre , she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women , mothers , widows , or maidens , who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves , and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great penance .
 She nursed her child herself , made swaddling − bands for it out of her coverlet , the only one which she had on her bed , and no longer felt either cold or hunger .
 It is certain that if the soul had not already quitted this inert , sluggish , lethargic body , it had at least retreated and concealed itself in depths whither the perceptions of the exterior organs no longer penetrated .
 It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all , that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries , and that from the moment he presented himself , there existed among them a secret , suppressed rivalry , which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves , but which broke forth , none the less , every instant , in their gestures and remarks .
 `` The devil ! '' said Jehan , to himself , `` it is a long while to wait for a crown ! ''
 `` Master Pierrat − − Master Jacques , I mean , busy yourself with Marc Cenaine . ''
 For a while she had tried to count the black minutes measured off for her by the drop of water ; but that melancholy labor of an ailing brain had broken off of itself in her head , and had left her in stupor .
 There was another moment when , while laughing diabolically at himself , he represented to himself la Esmeralda as he had seen her on that first day , lively , careless , joyous , gayly attired , dancing , winged , harmonious , and la Esmeralda of the last day , in her scanty shift , with a rope about her neck , mounting slowly with her bare feet , the angular ladder of the gallows ; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner .that he gave vent to a terrible cry .
 Let us add that the church , that vast church , which surrounded her on every side , which guarded her , which saved her , was itself a sovereign tranquillizer .
 The priest , beside himself , was about to seize it .
 He had thought it very simple on the part of people who had , like herself , nothing else in prospect but Charmolue and Torterue , and who , unlike himself , did not gallop through the regions of imagination between the wings of Pegasus .
 The locksmiths , although protected by the deep vaults of the portal , abandoned the door and Clopin himself retired to a respectful distance from the church .
 Hold , Master Olivier ; I desire to see that cage myself .
 A touch from the young girl , as she drew her foot from under him , brought him to himself .
 In itself , he found the order very welcome .
 Miss Bürstner looked at the floor in front of her , quiet and a little sunk in on herself .
 And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself .
 On the other hand , it was possible that the officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court 's purposes .
 The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself , saluted , and hurried on , walking with very short steps , probably because of gout .
 If you do n't want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I 've sorted out my report , then I 'll be glad to go back with you again . "
 But so much soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off K. 's hands with her handkerchief , as K. was too tired to do that for himself .
 So please , be so kind as to help me on my way a little , I 'm feeling dizzy , you see , and it 'll make me ill if I stand up by myself . "
 `` Yes , '' said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh , " I wanted to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she 's stubborn , she wants to move everything in herself .
 But will you push things forward yourself with all your strength , if so , that will naturally be far better . "
 Never attract attention to yourself !
 How could he ever carry on by himself after he 's taken on help from a lawyer ?
 But the deputy director did not notice this at all , or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits , he frequently laughed out loud , one time he clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself , and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion .
 Now , in contrast , if he was to conduct his defence himself , he would have to devote himself entirely to the court - for the time being , at least - success would mean , later on , his complete and conclusive liberation , but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself , to start with , in far greater danger than he had been in so far .
 Perhaps - this is what I 've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to help you in some small way , he knows lots of judges and even if he ca n't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side .
 He felt himself as much at liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower standing , keeping everything about himself to himself , speaking only casually about the interests of the other , able to raise him to a level above one 's own , but also able , at will , to let him drop again .
 The superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves . "
 But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there 's a small error running through what he says , and , just for your interest , I 'll tell you about it .
 For himself , he wanted to go to the lawyer and , by dismissing him , free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman . But before he had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently .
 Embarrassed , Block ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet , his anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the lawyer for a while , he thought only about himself and turned the judges words round to examine them from all sides .
 He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - they were standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself , but then - he gave no more precise reason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. with him .
 `` Some ancient , unimportant actors - that 's what they 've sent for me , '' said K. to himself , and looked round once again to confirm this to himself . `` They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can . ''
 K. now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself .
 It was a simple matter to throw off the covers ; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves .
 `` But Sir , '' called Gregor , beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement , " I 'll open up immediately , just a moment .
 Whatever was said next would be crucial , so , in order to make his voice as clear as possible , he coughed a little , but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself .
 This is what peace I get in my old age ! " And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself , let the women take him to the door , send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor 's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him .
 When they are , it is easier to hold them , especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government ; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them ; because the two peoples , preserving in other things the old conditions , and not being unlike in customs , will live quietly together , as one has seen in Brittany , Burgundy , Gascony , and Normandy , which have been bound to France for so long a time : and , although there may be some difference in language , nevertheless the customs are alike , and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves .
 And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves , each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country , according to the authority he had assumed there ; and the family of the former lord being exterminated , none other than the Romans were acknowledged .
 But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince , and his family is exterminated , they , being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince , can not agree in making one from amongst themselves , and they do not know how to govern themselves .
 For this reason they are very slow to take up arms , and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily .
 Hence it is to be remarked that , in seizing a state , the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict , and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily ; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them , and win them to himself by benefits .
 It was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .
 Oblonsky understood that Matthew meant to have a joke and draw attention to himself .
 He thought a plain kindly fellow like himself might be loved as a friend , but to be loved with the kind of love he felt for Kitty , a man must be handsome and above all remarkable .
 He had to make an effort and reason with himself that all sorts of people were passing near her and he himself might have come just to skate .
 When he thought about her he could vividly picture to himself her entire person , and especially the charm of her small , fair-haired head , so lightly poised on the shapely girlish shoulders , and the childlike brightness and kindness of her face .
 Oblonsky repeated these lines with a subtle smile and Levin himself could not help smiling . ' No , but joking apart , ' continued Oblonsky , ' just consider .
 She felt that this evening , when those two men were to meet for the first time , would decide her fate ; and she kept picturing them to herself , now individually and now together .
 ' Oh God , must I tell him so myself ? ' she thought . ' Must I really tell him that I do n't care for him ?
 As soon as her brother came up to her she threw her left arm round his neck with a movement that struck Vronsky by its firmness and grace , and drawing him to herself gave him a vigorous kiss .
 But have a wash and smarten yourself up , ' said the Baroness , again sitting down and carefully turning a small screw of the coffee-pot . ' Pierre , pass me the coffee , ' she said to Petritsky whom , not concealing their relations , she called Pierre ( the French for Peter ) , because of his surname .
 Now she knew them all as well as the inhabitants of a provincial town know one another ; she knew the habits and weaknesses of each of them , and where the shoe pinched this or that foot ; she knew their relations to one another and to the governing centre ; she knew who sided with whom , and how and by what means each supported himself , and who agreed or disagreed with whom and about what ; but ( in spite of admonitions and advice from the Countess Lydia Ivanovna ) this bureaucratic circle of male interests could not interest Anna , and she avoided it .
 No one knows ; but their host 's footman , in answer to their question whether `` girls '' lived there , replies that there are a lot of them thereabouts . After dinner the young men go into the host 's study to compose a letter to the fair stranger , and , having written one full of passion and containing a declaration , they carry it upstairs themselves , in order to explain anything that might not be quite clear in the letter . '
 One of us is stupid , and you know it 's impossible to say so of oneself . '
 Not these two ladies alone , but nearly all those present in the drawing-room , even the Princess Myagkaya and Betsy herself , several times glanced across at the pair who had gone away from the general circle , as if their having done so disturbed the others .
 I do n't like to do things badly myself and I see that others do n't .
 Oblonsky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the varnished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
 ' Here it is ! ' answered Levin , pointing to Laska , who with one ear erect , wagging her fluffy , high-arched tail , stepping slowly as if to prolong the pleasure and seeming almost to smile , brought the dead bird to her master . ' Well , I 'm glad you got it , ' said Levin , and while he spoke he was already experiencing a feeling of envy at not having killed the bird himself .
 They had not arranged this , but it had come about of itself .
 It was as if there was something that she could not , and would not , make clear to herself , or as if , as soon as she began to speak about this matter , she , the real Anna , withdrew into herself and another woman appeared who was strange and alien to him , whom he feared and did not like , and who resisted him .
 I will tell it you all in advance , ' and an evil light came into her eyes which a minute before had been so tender . ' - `` Ah , you love another and have entered into a guilty union with him ? '' - ' ( mimicking her husband , she laid just such a stress on the word guilty as Karenin himself would have done ) . ' - " I warned you of the consequences from the religious , civil , and family points of view .
 He is not a man , but a machine , and a cruel machine when angry , ' she added , picturing Karenin to herself with every detail of his figure and way of speaking ,
 Karenin thought and said that in no previous year had he had so much official business as this year ; but he was not conscious of the fact that this year he invented work for himself , and that this was one of the means of keeping that compartment closed where lay his feelings for and thoughts of his family , which became more terrible the longer they lay there .
 He did not let himself think about this and did not think about it , yet at the bottom of his soul , without admitting it to himself or having any proofs or even suspicions of it , he nevertheless knew certainly that he was a wronged husband , and was therefore profoundly unhappy .
 Without acknowledging it to himself , Karenin now looked out for opportunities of having a third person present at his interviews with his wife .
 ' Well , if you want to so much , I will inquire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' What do you see particular in her ?
 ' Shameful in what respect ? ' she said . ' You could not have told a man who was himself indifferent to you that you loved him ? '
 It was one of those things which one knows and yet can not say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
 ' I do n't know very well myself .
 He did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for impairing his peace of mind and his honour . And having reviewed the possibilities of a duel , of divorce , and of separation , and having again rejected them , Karenin came to the conclusion that there was only one course to be followed : to keep her with him , hiding from the world what had happened , and taking all necessary steps to put a stop to her love-affair , and above all ( though he did not confess this to himself to punish her .
 Like all such matters it went on of itself , by inertia .
 The approaching step of the footman recalled her to herself , and hiding her face from him she pretended to be writing .
 But latterly new inner relations had sprung up between himself and her , which frightened him by their indefiniteness .
 Ambition was the old motive of his childhood and youth , one which he did not acknowledge even to himself , but which was so strong a passion that it now struggled against his love .
 ' It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irritably . ' And here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her glove .
 She understood at once that he had already considered this by himself , knew that whatever he might say he would not tell her all that he was thinking , and knew that her last hopes had been deceived .
 ' Ours is peasant 's business ; we look after everything ourselves .
 ' All I wish to say is , ' said Levin , ' why should we not seek them for ourselves ? '
 ' And how do you agree with Spencer yourself in this matter ? '
 But in spite of this , Levin thought matters were getting on , and that by keeping strict accounts and insisting on having his way he would eventually be able to prove to the peasants the advantage of these new arrangements , and that things would then go on of themselves .
 ' I am not bothering about them : I am doing it for myself . '
 ' That 's all very well , but you think only of yourself !
 Karenin smiled coldly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lacerated his wound .
 Wait a bit . I will tell you about myself .
 He was vexed , not so much at having missed that post himself and at having been obviously passed over , as at the incomprehensible and surprising fact that they did not realize how much less suitable than anyone else was that voluble windbag , Stremov .
 Try and realize it : even his looks have a physical effect on me and drive me beside myself .
 I understand that you can not take it upon yourself to express your wishes and feelings . '
 She could not think of or desire anything but life with this man ; but , as that life had not yet begun , she could not even clearly picture it to herself .
 Though he had imagined his ideas about family life to be most exact , he , like all men , had involuntarily pictured it to himself as merely the enjoyment of love - which nothing should be allowed to hinder and from which one should not be distracted by petty cares .
 They both tried in after life to efface from their memories all the ugly shameful circumstances of this unhealthy time during which they were rarely in a normal state and rarely themselves .
 She ordered supper to be brought , unpacked their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprinkle insect powder on them .
 Only the invalid himself did not show that desire , but on the contrary was angry because the doctor had not been fetched , and he continued taking medicine and talking of life .
 Without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
 He felt that he could not divert from himself people 's hatred , because that hatred was caused not by his badness ( had it been so he might have tried to be better ) but by his disgraceful and repulsive misery .
 Do not thank me . I am not doing it of myself ... '
 ' But , my dear friend , do not give way to that feeling you were speaking about - of being ashamed of that which is the utmost height of Christianity ! `` He that humbleth himself shall be exalted , '' and you must not thank me ! - You must thank Him , and ask Him for help .
 Forgive me for reminding you of myself .
 Renewed pain for yourself , and pain for the child !
 This letter achieved the secret purpose which the Countess Lydia Ivanovna hid even from herself . It wounded Anna to the depths of her soul .
 ' Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . '
 He was aware that the teacher himself did not believe what he was saying ; he felt that by the tone in which the words were uttered . ' But why have they all agreed to speak in the same way about the dullest and most useless things ?
 Tushkevich , Yashvin , the Princess Barbara ... ' he pictured them to himself . ' And what of me ?
 All these were relations and friends of Kitty 's , and , though Levin liked them , he regretted his own - the Levin - world and order of things , which was being submerged by this influx of ' the Shcherbatsky element , ' as he put it to himself .
 ' It 's very nice at their place , ' Vasenka was saying , talking of Vronsky and Anna . ' Of course I do not take it upon myself to judge , but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family . '
 ' What the devil brings him here ? ' muttered Levin to himself , turning back to the vehicle . ' Why did you leave the road ? ' he asked drily , and calling the coachman , set to work to get the horses out .
 ' Do you know , you will bring trouble on yourself , ' said Oblonsky , having found his cap and getting up .
 Here they are themselves ! ' cried the man , pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a char-a-banc coming along the road .
 ' Tell me about yourselves . I meet Steve in passing , but he ca n't tell me about the children .
 The Count goes into everything himself .
 Veslovsky offered his arm to the Princess Barbara before Tushkevich could do so , so that the latter , the steward , and the doctor went in by themselves .
 Vasenka Veslovsky , her husband , and even Sviyazhsky and many others whom she knew , never thought about these things , and readily believed , what every decent host wishes his guests to feel , that all that is so well arranged at his house has cost him no trouble but has come about of itself .
 ' But tell me about yourself . I have much to talk to you about and I have been talking with ...
 There she not only helped , but arranged and planned many things herself .
 Nevertheless , her chief preoccupation was still herself - herself in so far as Vronsky held her dear and in so far as she could compensate him for all he had given up .
 With him it was a sign of great displeasure , not with her but with himself .
 Well , you see , any other woman in her position might fail to find resources in herself .
 I restrain myself , wait , invent occupations for myself , - the English family , writing , reading , but all that is only deception , it is all a kind of morphia .
 ' Is it possible that I ca n't ... ? Is it possible that I ca n't take it on myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning .
 And death , as the sole means of reviving love for herself in his heart , of punishing him , and of gaining the victory in that contest which an evil spirit in her heart was waging against him , presented itself clearly and vividly to her .
 ' Well , in that case I know what I must do , ' said she to herself , and conscious of a vague sense of wrath and a desire for vengeance rising within her , she ran upstairs . ' I shall go to him myself .
 Remembering Karenin , she pictured him to herself with extraordinary vividness , as if he stood before her , with his mild , dull , lifeless eyes , the blue veins of his white hands , his intonations , his cracking fingers , and remembering the feeling that had once existed between them and which had also been called love , she shuddered with revulsion . ' Well , I get divorced and become Vronsky 's wife !
 ' There ! ' she said to herself , looking at the shadow of the truck on the mingled sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers . ' There , into the very middle , and I shall punish him and escape from everybody and from myself ! '
 He admitted that the papers published much that was unnecessary and exaggerated with the sole aim of drawing attention to themselves , each outcrying the other .
 These matters interested him , not because he justified them to himself by any general theories as he had done previously ; on the contrary , being now on the one hand disenchanted by the ill-success of his former occupations for the general welfare , and on the other hand too much occupied with his own thoughts and by the mass of affairs that overwhelmed him from all sides , he quite abandoned all calculation of public utility , and these matters interested him only because it seemed to him that he had to do what he was doing , and could not act otherwise .
 It seemed to him that he had a reply to that question ; but he had no time to express it to himself before he entered the nursery .
 Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien , and very sincere and honest at heart ; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence , and so separated them from worldly matters , that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days .
 `` Hello yourself , and see how you like it . ''
 You got to go all by yourself , to the middle of the woods , where you know there 's a spunk-water stump , and just as it 's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say :
 If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom 's disjointed mutterings , he kept it to himself .
 Because if he 'd had one she 'd a burnt him out herself !
 `` It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be -- and laws bless me , to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream , never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour , and I never to see him again in this world , never , never , never , poor abused boy ! ''
 When the worst came to the worst , she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple , but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still -- because , said she to herself , " he 'll tell about me tearing the picture sure .
 `` Lordy , I do n't want to foller him by myself ! ''
 If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition , and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works .
`` It is well I drew the curtain , '' thought I ; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would John Reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but Eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once --
Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye , but seldom addressed me : since my illness , she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself , condemning me to take my meals alone , and pass all my time in the nursery , while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room .
There are many others who have no friends , who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ? "
It would be difficult to say : I could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet I had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England , and I said yes ; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to England , and now he is gone back again himself , and I never see him . "
`` Was that Grace Poole ? and is she possessed with a devil ? '' thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself : I must go to Mrs. Fairfax .
For herself , she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers , jump on and off the bedsteads , and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys .
Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below ; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled , oaken chamber of the second storey : there she sat and sewed -- and probably laughed drearily to herself , -- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon .
For myself , I had no need to make any change ; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom ; for a sanctum it was now become to me , -- `` a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble . ''
`` She says , sir , that she 'll have no gentlemen ; they need not trouble themselves to come near her ; nor , '' he added , with difficulty suppressing a titter , `` any ladies either , except the young , and single . ''
I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy , whose strange talk , voice , manner , had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream .
`` Never fear -- I will take care of myself . ''
So I addressed the housekeeper ; asked her to show me a room , told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two , had my trunk conveyed to my chamber , and followed it thither myself : I met Bessie on the landing .
The communications were renewed from day to day : they always ran on the same theme -- herself , her loves , and woes .
`` I will leave you by yourself , white dream , '' I said .
The cloven halves were not broken from each other , for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below ; though community of vitality was destroyed -- the sap could flow no more : their great boughs on each side were dead , and next winter 's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth : as yet , however , they might be said to form one tree -- a ruin , but an entire ruin .
He could not then hasten to England himself , to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen , but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage .
Far from desiring to publish the connection , he became as anxious to conceal it as myself .
The next day I observed you -- myself unseen -- for half-an- hour , while you played with Adele in the gallery .
Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart , if you would : seized against your will , you will elude the grasp like an essence -- you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance .
Moreover , she is a sweet girl -- rather thoughtless ; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her .
It seems her career there was very honourable : from a pupil , she became a teacher , like yourself -- really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours -- she left it to be a governess : there , again , your fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester . "
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at present studying ; that , as he advanced , he was apt to forget the commencement ; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements , and so fix them thoroughly in his mind ; that his choice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters ; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three .
All the house was still ; for I believe all , except St. John and myself , were now retired to rest .
" Yes , indeed was he ; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below , and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself , and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell .
' Well ! ' thought Alice to herself , ' after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ' Which way ? Which way ? ' , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
' Why , ' said the Dodo , ' the best way to explain it is to do it . ' ( And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . )
' I ca n't explain myself , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not myself , you see . '
' My name is Alice , so please your Majesty , ' said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , ' Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all .
Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after-time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child-life , and the happy summer days .
When he went for walks he talked to the servant , who , like himself , came from the country .
When he saw that the rest were far behind he stopped to take breath , slowly rosined his bow , so that the strings should sound more shrilly , then set off again , by turns lowering and raising his neck , the better to mark time for himself .
Then noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal , who yawned slowly , she softened , and comparing her to herself , spoke to her aloud as to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling .
Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat , rearranged his cravat , and threw away the dirty gloves he was going to put on ; and this was not , as he fancied , for himself ; it was for herself , by a diffusion of egotism , of nervous irritation .
She ordered dishes for herself , then she did not touch them ; one day drank only pure milk , the next cups of tea by the dozen .
`` Moreover , '' said the druggist , `` the practice of medicine is not very hard work in our part of the world , for the state of our roads allows us the use of gigs , and generally , as the farmers are prosperous , they pay pretty well . We have , medically speaking , besides the ordinary cases of enteritis , bronchitis , bilious affections , etc . , now and then a few intermittent fevers at harvest-time ; but on the whole , little of a serious nature , nothing special to note , unless it be a great deal of scrofula , due , no doubt , to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our peasant dwellings . Ah ! you will find many prejudices to combat , Monsieur Bovary , much obstinacy of routine , with which all the efforts of your science will daily come into collision ; for people still have recourse to novenas , to relics , to the priest , rather than come straight to the doctor or the chemist . The climate , however , is not , truth to tell , bad , and we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish . The thermometer ( I have made some observations ) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade at the outside , which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum , or otherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit ( English scale ) , not more . And , as a matter of fact , we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of Argueil on the one side , from the west winds by the St. Jean range on the other ; and this heat , moreover , which , on account of the aqueous vapours given off by the river and the considerable number of cattle in the fields , which , as you know , exhale much ammonia , that is to say , nitrogen , hydrogen and oxygen ( no , nitrogen and hydrogen alone ) , and which sucking up into itself the humus from the ground , mixing together all those different emanations , unites them into a stack , so to say , and combining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere , when there is any , might in the long run , as in tropical countries , engender insalubrious miasmata - this heat , I say , finds itself perfectly tempered on the side whence it comes , or rather whence it should come - that is to say , the southern side - by the south-eastern winds , which , having cooled themselves passing over the Seine , reach us sometimes all at once like breezes from Russia . ''
He had knocked about the world , he talked about Berlin , Vienna , and Strasbourg , of his soldier times , of the mistresses he had had , the grand luncheons of which he had partaken ; then he was amiable , and sometimes even , either on the stairs , or in the garden , would seize hold of her waist , crying , `` Charles , look out for yourself . ''
The fire was out , the clock went on ticking , and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of all things while within herself was such tumult .
Mind the cold ; take care of yourself ; look after yourself . "
" Apply yourselves , above all , to the amelioration of the soil , to good manures , to the development of the equine , bovine , ovine , and porcine races .
She asked him for some verses - some verses `` for herself , '' a `` love poem '' in honour of her .
`` Do n't see them ; do n't go out ; think only of ourselves ; love me ! ''
In fact someone had sent his mother a long anonymous letter to warn her that he was `` ruining himself with a married woman , '' and the good lady at once conjuring up the eternal bugbear of families , the vague pernicious creature , the siren , the monster , who dwells fantastically in depths of love , wrote to Lawyer Dubocage , his employer , who behaved perfectly in the affair . He kept him for three quarters of an hour trying to open his eyes , to warn him of the abyss into which he was falling . Such an intrigue would damage him later on , when he set up for himself . He implored him to break with her , and , if he would not make this sacrifice in his own interest , to do it at least for his , Dubocage 's sake .
Everything , even herself , was now unbearable to her .
The persons who , like ourselves , never cross the Place de Grève without casting a glance of pity and sympathy on that poor turret strangled between two hovels of the time of Louis XV . , can easily reconstruct in their minds the aggregate of edifices to which it belonged , and find again entire in it the ancient Gothic place of the fifteenth century .
You form for yourselves a great idea of the thing .
The new art takes the monument where it finds it , incrusts itself there , assimilates it to itself , develops it according to its fancy , and finishes it if it can .
A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre − Dame .
He took it upon himself to reply to the archdeacon 's question , − −
At her death , at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre , she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women , mothers , widows , or maidens , who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves , and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great penance .
She nursed her child herself , made swaddling − bands for it out of her coverlet , the only one which she had on her bed , and no longer felt either cold or hunger .
It is certain that if the soul had not already quitted this inert , sluggish , lethargic body , it had at least retreated and concealed itself in depths whither the perceptions of the exterior organs no longer penetrated .
It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all , that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries , and that from the moment he presented himself , there existed among them a secret , suppressed rivalry , which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves , but which broke forth , none the less , every instant , in their gestures and remarks .
`` The devil ! '' said Jehan , to himself , `` it is a long while to wait for a crown ! ''
`` Master Pierrat − − Master Jacques , I mean , busy yourself with Marc Cenaine . ''
For a while she had tried to count the black minutes measured off for her by the drop of water ; but that melancholy labor of an ailing brain had broken off of itself in her head , and had left her in stupor .
There was another moment when , while laughing diabolically at himself , he represented to himself la Esmeralda as he had seen her on that first day , lively , careless , joyous , gayly attired , dancing , winged , harmonious , and la Esmeralda of the last day , in her scanty shift , with a rope about her neck , mounting slowly with her bare feet , the angular ladder of the gallows ; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner .that he gave vent to a terrible cry .
Let us add that the church , that vast church , which surrounded her on every side , which guarded her , which saved her , was itself a sovereign tranquillizer .
The priest , beside himself , was about to seize it .
He had thought it very simple on the part of people who had , like herself , nothing else in prospect but Charmolue and Torterue , and who , unlike himself , did not gallop through the regions of imagination between the wings of Pegasus .
The locksmiths , although protected by the deep vaults of the portal , abandoned the door and Clopin himself retired to a respectful distance from the church .
Hold , Master Olivier ; I desire to see that cage myself .
A touch from the young girl , as she drew her foot from under him , brought him to himself .
In itself , he found the order very welcome .
Miss Bürstner looked at the floor in front of her , quiet and a little sunk in on herself .
And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself .
On the other hand , it was possible that the officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court 's purposes .
The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself , saluted , and hurried on , walking with very short steps , probably because of gout .
If you do n't want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I 've sorted out my report , then I 'll be glad to go back with you again . "
But so much soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off K. 's hands with her handkerchief , as K. was too tired to do that for himself .
So please , be so kind as to help me on my way a little , I 'm feeling dizzy , you see , and it 'll make me ill if I stand up by myself . "
`` Yes , '' said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh , " I wanted to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she 's stubborn , she wants to move everything in herself .
But will you push things forward yourself with all your strength , if so , that will naturally be far better . "
Never attract attention to yourself !
How could he ever carry on by himself after he 's taken on help from a lawyer ?
But the deputy director did not notice this at all , or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits , he frequently laughed out loud , one time he clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself , and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion .
Now , in contrast , if he was to conduct his defence himself , he would have to devote himself entirely to the court - for the time being , at least - success would mean , later on , his complete and conclusive liberation , but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself , to start with , in far greater danger than he had been in so far .
Perhaps - this is what I 've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to help you in some small way , he knows lots of judges and even if he ca n't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side .
He felt himself as much at liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower standing , keeping everything about himself to himself , speaking only casually about the interests of the other , able to raise him to a level above one 's own , but also able , at will , to let him drop again .
The superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves . "
But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there 's a small error running through what he says , and , just for your interest , I 'll tell you about it .
For himself , he wanted to go to the lawyer and , by dismissing him , free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman . But before he had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently .
Embarrassed , Block ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet , his anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the lawyer for a while , he thought only about himself and turned the judges words round to examine them from all sides .
He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - they were standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself , but then - he gave no more precise reason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. with him .
`` Some ancient , unimportant actors - that 's what they 've sent for me , '' said K. to himself , and looked round once again to confirm this to himself . `` They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can . ''
K. now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself .
It was a simple matter to throw off the covers ; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves .
`` But Sir , '' called Gregor , beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement , " I 'll open up immediately , just a moment .
Whatever was said next would be crucial , so , in order to make his voice as clear as possible , he coughed a little , but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself .
This is what peace I get in my old age ! " And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself , let the women take him to the door , send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor 's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him .
When they are , it is easier to hold them , especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government ; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them ; because the two peoples , preserving in other things the old conditions , and not being unlike in customs , will live quietly together , as one has seen in Brittany , Burgundy , Gascony , and Normandy , which have been bound to France for so long a time : and , although there may be some difference in language , nevertheless the customs are alike , and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves .
And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves , each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country , according to the authority he had assumed there ; and the family of the former lord being exterminated , none other than the Romans were acknowledged .
But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince , and his family is exterminated , they , being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince , can not agree in making one from amongst themselves , and they do not know how to govern themselves .
For this reason they are very slow to take up arms , and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily .
Hence it is to be remarked that , in seizing a state , the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict , and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily ; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them , and win them to himself by benefits .
It was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .
Oblonsky understood that Matthew meant to have a joke and draw attention to himself .
He thought a plain kindly fellow like himself might be loved as a friend , but to be loved with the kind of love he felt for Kitty , a man must be handsome and above all remarkable .
He had to make an effort and reason with himself that all sorts of people were passing near her and he himself might have come just to skate .
When he thought about her he could vividly picture to himself her entire person , and especially the charm of her small , fair-haired head , so lightly poised on the shapely girlish shoulders , and the childlike brightness and kindness of her face .
Oblonsky repeated these lines with a subtle smile and Levin himself could not help smiling . ' No , but joking apart , ' continued Oblonsky , ' just consider .
She felt that this evening , when those two men were to meet for the first time , would decide her fate ; and she kept picturing them to herself , now individually and now together .
' Oh God , must I tell him so myself ? ' she thought . ' Must I really tell him that I do n't care for him ?
As soon as her brother came up to her she threw her left arm round his neck with a movement that struck Vronsky by its firmness and grace , and drawing him to herself gave him a vigorous kiss .
But have a wash and smarten yourself up , ' said the Baroness , again sitting down and carefully turning a small screw of the coffee-pot . ' Pierre , pass me the coffee , ' she said to Petritsky whom , not concealing their relations , she called Pierre ( the French for Peter ) , because of his surname .
Now she knew them all as well as the inhabitants of a provincial town know one another ; she knew the habits and weaknesses of each of them , and where the shoe pinched this or that foot ; she knew their relations to one another and to the governing centre ; she knew who sided with whom , and how and by what means each supported himself , and who agreed or disagreed with whom and about what ; but ( in spite of admonitions and advice from the Countess Lydia Ivanovna ) this bureaucratic circle of male interests could not interest Anna , and she avoided it .
No one knows ; but their host 's footman , in answer to their question whether `` girls '' lived there , replies that there are a lot of them thereabouts . After dinner the young men go into the host 's study to compose a letter to the fair stranger , and , having written one full of passion and containing a declaration , they carry it upstairs themselves , in order to explain anything that might not be quite clear in the letter . '
One of us is stupid , and you know it 's impossible to say so of oneself . '
Not these two ladies alone , but nearly all those present in the drawing-room , even the Princess Myagkaya and Betsy herself , several times glanced across at the pair who had gone away from the general circle , as if their having done so disturbed the others .
I do n't like to do things badly myself and I see that others do n't .
Oblonsky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the varnished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
' Here it is ! ' answered Levin , pointing to Laska , who with one ear erect , wagging her fluffy , high-arched tail , stepping slowly as if to prolong the pleasure and seeming almost to smile , brought the dead bird to her master . ' Well , I 'm glad you got it , ' said Levin , and while he spoke he was already experiencing a feeling of envy at not having killed the bird himself .
They had not arranged this , but it had come about of itself .
It was as if there was something that she could not , and would not , make clear to herself , or as if , as soon as she began to speak about this matter , she , the real Anna , withdrew into herself and another woman appeared who was strange and alien to him , whom he feared and did not like , and who resisted him .
I will tell it you all in advance , ' and an evil light came into her eyes which a minute before had been so tender . ' - `` Ah , you love another and have entered into a guilty union with him ? '' - ' ( mimicking her husband , she laid just such a stress on the word guilty as Karenin himself would have done ) . ' - " I warned you of the consequences from the religious , civil , and family points of view .
He is not a man , but a machine , and a cruel machine when angry , ' she added , picturing Karenin to herself with every detail of his figure and way of speaking ,
Karenin thought and said that in no previous year had he had so much official business as this year ; but he was not conscious of the fact that this year he invented work for himself , and that this was one of the means of keeping that compartment closed where lay his feelings for and thoughts of his family , which became more terrible the longer they lay there .
He did not let himself think about this and did not think about it , yet at the bottom of his soul , without admitting it to himself or having any proofs or even suspicions of it , he nevertheless knew certainly that he was a wronged husband , and was therefore profoundly unhappy .
Without acknowledging it to himself , Karenin now looked out for opportunities of having a third person present at his interviews with his wife .
' Well , if you want to so much , I will inquire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' What do you see particular in her ?
' Shameful in what respect ? ' she said . ' You could not have told a man who was himself indifferent to you that you loved him ? '
It was one of those things which one knows and yet can not say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
' I do n't know very well myself .
He did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for impairing his peace of mind and his honour . And having reviewed the possibilities of a duel , of divorce , and of separation , and having again rejected them , Karenin came to the conclusion that there was only one course to be followed : to keep her with him , hiding from the world what had happened , and taking all necessary steps to put a stop to her love-affair , and above all ( though he did not confess this to himself to punish her .
Like all such matters it went on of itself , by inertia .
The approaching step of the footman recalled her to herself , and hiding her face from him she pretended to be writing .
But latterly new inner relations had sprung up between himself and her , which frightened him by their indefiniteness .
Ambition was the old motive of his childhood and youth , one which he did not acknowledge even to himself , but which was so strong a passion that it now struggled against his love .
' It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irritably . ' And here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her glove .
She understood at once that he had already considered this by himself , knew that whatever he might say he would not tell her all that he was thinking , and knew that her last hopes had been deceived .
' Ours is peasant 's business ; we look after everything ourselves .
' All I wish to say is , ' said Levin , ' why should we not seek them for ourselves ? '
' And how do you agree with Spencer yourself in this matter ? '
But in spite of this , Levin thought matters were getting on , and that by keeping strict accounts and insisting on having his way he would eventually be able to prove to the peasants the advantage of these new arrangements , and that things would then go on of themselves .
' I am not bothering about them : I am doing it for myself . '
' That 's all very well , but you think only of yourself !
Karenin smiled coldly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lacerated his wound .
Wait a bit . I will tell you about myself .
He was vexed , not so much at having missed that post himself and at having been obviously passed over , as at the incomprehensible and surprising fact that they did not realize how much less suitable than anyone else was that voluble windbag , Stremov .
Try and realize it : even his looks have a physical effect on me and drive me beside myself .
I understand that you can not take it upon yourself to express your wishes and feelings . '
She could not think of or desire anything but life with this man ; but , as that life had not yet begun , she could not even clearly picture it to herself .
Though he had imagined his ideas about family life to be most exact , he , like all men , had involuntarily pictured it to himself as merely the enjoyment of love - which nothing should be allowed to hinder and from which one should not be distracted by petty cares .
They both tried in after life to efface from their memories all the ugly shameful circumstances of this unhealthy time during which they were rarely in a normal state and rarely themselves .
She ordered supper to be brought , unpacked their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprinkle insect powder on them .
Only the invalid himself did not show that desire , but on the contrary was angry because the doctor had not been fetched , and he continued taking medicine and talking of life .
Without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
He felt that he could not divert from himself people 's hatred , because that hatred was caused not by his badness ( had it been so he might have tried to be better ) but by his disgraceful and repulsive misery .
Do not thank me . I am not doing it of myself ... '
' But , my dear friend , do not give way to that feeling you were speaking about - of being ashamed of that which is the utmost height of Christianity ! `` He that humbleth himself shall be exalted , '' and you must not thank me ! - You must thank Him , and ask Him for help .
Forgive me for reminding you of myself .
Renewed pain for yourself , and pain for the child !
This letter achieved the secret purpose which the Countess Lydia Ivanovna hid even from herself . It wounded Anna to the depths of her soul .
' Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . '
He was aware that the teacher himself did not believe what he was saying ; he felt that by the tone in which the words were uttered . ' But why have they all agreed to speak in the same way about the dullest and most useless things ?
Tushkevich , Yashvin , the Princess Barbara ... ' he pictured them to himself . ' And what of me ?
All these were relations and friends of Kitty 's , and , though Levin liked them , he regretted his own - the Levin - world and order of things , which was being submerged by this influx of ' the Shcherbatsky element , ' as he put it to himself .
' It 's very nice at their place , ' Vasenka was saying , talking of Vronsky and Anna . ' Of course I do not take it upon myself to judge , but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family . '
' What the devil brings him here ? ' muttered Levin to himself , turning back to the vehicle . ' Why did you leave the road ? ' he asked drily , and calling the coachman , set to work to get the horses out .
' Do you know , you will bring trouble on yourself , ' said Oblonsky , having found his cap and getting up .
Here they are themselves ! ' cried the man , pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a char-a-banc coming along the road .
' Tell me about yourselves . I meet Steve in passing , but he ca n't tell me about the children .
The Count goes into everything himself .
Veslovsky offered his arm to the Princess Barbara before Tushkevich could do so , so that the latter , the steward , and the doctor went in by themselves .
Vasenka Veslovsky , her husband , and even Sviyazhsky and many others whom she knew , never thought about these things , and readily believed , what every decent host wishes his guests to feel , that all that is so well arranged at his house has cost him no trouble but has come about of itself .
' But tell me about yourself . I have much to talk to you about and I have been talking with ...
There she not only helped , but arranged and planned many things herself .
Nevertheless , her chief preoccupation was still herself - herself in so far as Vronsky held her dear and in so far as she could compensate him for all he had given up .
With him it was a sign of great displeasure , not with her but with himself .
Well , you see , any other woman in her position might fail to find resources in herself .
I restrain myself , wait , invent occupations for myself , - the English family , writing , reading , but all that is only deception , it is all a kind of morphia .
' Is it possible that I ca n't ... ? Is it possible that I ca n't take it on myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning .
And death , as the sole means of reviving love for herself in his heart , of punishing him , and of gaining the victory in that contest which an evil spirit in her heart was waging against him , presented itself clearly and vividly to her .
' Well , in that case I know what I must do , ' said she to herself , and conscious of a vague sense of wrath and a desire for vengeance rising within her , she ran upstairs . ' I shall go to him myself .
Remembering Karenin , she pictured him to herself with extraordinary vividness , as if he stood before her , with his mild , dull , lifeless eyes , the blue veins of his white hands , his intonations , his cracking fingers , and remembering the feeling that had once existed between them and which had also been called love , she shuddered with revulsion . ' Well , I get divorced and become Vronsky 's wife !
' There ! ' she said to herself , looking at the shadow of the truck on the mingled sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers . ' There , into the very middle , and I shall punish him and escape from everybody and from myself ! '
He admitted that the papers published much that was unnecessary and exaggerated with the sole aim of drawing attention to themselves , each outcrying the other .
These matters interested him , not because he justified them to himself by any general theories as he had done previously ; on the contrary , being now on the one hand disenchanted by the ill-success of his former occupations for the general welfare , and on the other hand too much occupied with his own thoughts and by the mass of affairs that overwhelmed him from all sides , he quite abandoned all calculation of public utility , and these matters interested him only because it seemed to him that he had to do what he was doing , and could not act otherwise .
It seemed to him that he had a reply to that question ; but he had no time to express it to himself before he entered the nursery .
Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien , and very sincere and honest at heart ; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence , and so separated them from worldly matters , that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days .
`` Hello yourself , and see how you like it . ''
You got to go all by yourself , to the middle of the woods , where you know there 's a spunk-water stump , and just as it 's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say :
If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom 's disjointed mutterings , he kept it to himself .
Because if he 'd had one she 'd a burnt him out herself !
`` It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be -- and laws bless me , to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream , never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour , and I never to see him again in this world , never , never , never , poor abused boy ! ''
When the worst came to the worst , she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple , but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still -- because , said she to herself , " he 'll tell about me tearing the picture sure .
`` Lordy , I do n't want to foller him by myself ! ''
If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition , and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works .
`` It is well I drew the curtain , '' thought I ; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would John Reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but Eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once --
Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye , but seldom addressed me : since my illness , she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself , condemning me to take my meals alone , and pass all my time in the nursery , while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room .
There are many others who have no friends , who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ? "
It would be difficult to say : I could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet I had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England , and I said yes ; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to England , and now he is gone back again himself , and I never see him . "
`` Was that Grace Poole ? and is she possessed with a devil ? '' thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself : I must go to Mrs. Fairfax .
For herself , she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers , jump on and off the bedsteads , and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys .
Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below ; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled , oaken chamber of the second storey : there she sat and sewed -- and probably laughed drearily to herself , -- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon .
For myself , I had no need to make any change ; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom ; for a sanctum it was now become to me , -- `` a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble . ''
`` She says , sir , that she 'll have no gentlemen ; they need not trouble themselves to come near her ; nor , '' he added , with difficulty suppressing a titter , `` any ladies either , except the young , and single . ''
I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy , whose strange talk , voice , manner , had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream .
`` Never fear -- I will take care of myself . ''
So I addressed the housekeeper ; asked her to show me a room , told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two , had my trunk conveyed to my chamber , and followed it thither myself : I met Bessie on the landing .
The communications were renewed from day to day : they always ran on the same theme -- herself , her loves , and woes .
`` I will leave you by yourself , white dream , '' I said .
The cloven halves were not broken from each other , for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below ; though community of vitality was destroyed -- the sap could flow no more : their great boughs on each side were dead , and next winter 's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth : as yet , however , they might be said to form one tree -- a ruin , but an entire ruin .
He could not then hasten to England himself , to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen , but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage .
Far from desiring to publish the connection , he became as anxious to conceal it as myself .
The next day I observed you -- myself unseen -- for half-an- hour , while you played with Adele in the gallery .
Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart , if you would : seized against your will , you will elude the grasp like an essence -- you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance .
Moreover , she is a sweet girl -- rather thoughtless ; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her .
It seems her career there was very honourable : from a pupil , she became a teacher , like yourself -- really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours -- she left it to be a governess : there , again , your fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester . "
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at present studying ; that , as he advanced , he was apt to forget the commencement ; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements , and so fix them thoroughly in his mind ; that his choice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters ; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three .
All the house was still ; for I believe all , except St. John and myself , were now retired to rest .
" Yes , indeed was he ; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below , and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself , and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell .
' Well ! ' thought Alice to herself , ' after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ' Which way ? Which way ? ' , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
' Why , ' said the Dodo , ' the best way to explain it is to do it . ' ( And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . )
' I ca n't explain myself , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not myself , you see . '
' My name is Alice , so please your Majesty , ' said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , ' Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all .
Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after-time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child-life , and the happy summer days .
When he went for walks he talked to the servant , who , like himself , came from the country .
When he saw that the rest were far behind he stopped to take breath , slowly rosined his bow , so that the strings should sound more shrilly , then set off again , by turns lowering and raising his neck , the better to mark time for himself .
Then noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal , who yawned slowly , she softened , and comparing her to herself , spoke to her aloud as to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling .
Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat , rearranged his cravat , and threw away the dirty gloves he was going to put on ; and this was not , as he fancied , for himself ; it was for herself , by a diffusion of egotism , of nervous irritation .
She ordered dishes for herself , then she did not touch them ; one day drank only pure milk , the next cups of tea by the dozen .
`` Moreover , '' said the druggist , `` the practice of medicine is not very hard work in our part of the world , for the state of our roads allows us the use of gigs , and generally , as the farmers are prosperous , they pay pretty well . We have , medically speaking , besides the ordinary cases of enteritis , bronchitis , bilious affections , etc . , now and then a few intermittent fevers at harvest-time ; but on the whole , little of a serious nature , nothing special to note , unless it be a great deal of scrofula , due , no doubt , to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our peasant dwellings . Ah ! you will find many prejudices to combat , Monsieur Bovary , much obstinacy of routine , with which all the efforts of your science will daily come into collision ; for people still have recourse to novenas , to relics , to the priest , rather than come straight to the doctor or the chemist . The climate , however , is not , truth to tell , bad , and we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish . The thermometer ( I have made some observations ) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade at the outside , which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum , or otherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit ( English scale ) , not more . And , as a matter of fact , we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of Argueil on the one side , from the west winds by the St. Jean range on the other ; and this heat , moreover , which , on account of the aqueous vapours given off by the river and the considerable number of cattle in the fields , which , as you know , exhale much ammonia , that is to say , nitrogen , hydrogen and oxygen ( no , nitrogen and hydrogen alone ) , and which sucking up into itself the humus from the ground , mixing together all those different emanations , unites them into a stack , so to say , and combining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere , when there is any , might in the long run , as in tropical countries , engender insalubrious miasmata - this heat , I say , finds itself perfectly tempered on the side whence it comes , or rather whence it should come - that is to say , the southern side - by the south-eastern winds , which , having cooled themselves passing over the Seine , reach us sometimes all at once like breezes from Russia . ''
He had knocked about the world , he talked about Berlin , Vienna , and Strasbourg , of his soldier times , of the mistresses he had had , the grand luncheons of which he had partaken ; then he was amiable , and sometimes even , either on the stairs , or in the garden , would seize hold of her waist , crying , `` Charles , look out for yourself . ''
The fire was out , the clock went on ticking , and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of all things while within herself was such tumult .
Mind the cold ; take care of yourself ; look after yourself . "
" Apply yourselves , above all , to the amelioration of the soil , to good manures , to the development of the equine , bovine , ovine , and porcine races .
She asked him for some verses - some verses `` for herself , '' a `` love poem '' in honour of her .
`` Do n't see them ; do n't go out ; think only of ourselves ; love me ! ''
In fact someone had sent his mother a long anonymous letter to warn her that he was `` ruining himself with a married woman , '' and the good lady at once conjuring up the eternal bugbear of families , the vague pernicious creature , the siren , the monster , who dwells fantastically in depths of love , wrote to Lawyer Dubocage , his employer , who behaved perfectly in the affair . He kept him for three quarters of an hour trying to open his eyes , to warn him of the abyss into which he was falling . Such an intrigue would damage him later on , when he set up for himself . He implored him to break with her , and , if he would not make this sacrifice in his own interest , to do it at least for his , Dubocage 's sake .
Everything , even herself , was now unbearable to her .
The persons who , like ourselves , never cross the Place de Grève without casting a glance of pity and sympathy on that poor turret strangled between two hovels of the time of Louis XV . , can easily reconstruct in their minds the aggregate of edifices to which it belonged , and find again entire in it the ancient Gothic place of the fifteenth century .
You form for yourselves a great idea of the thing .
The new art takes the monument where it finds it , incrusts itself there , assimilates it to itself , develops it according to its fancy , and finishes it if it can .
A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre − Dame .
He took it upon himself to reply to the archdeacon 's question , − −
At her death , at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre , she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women , mothers , widows , or maidens , who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves , and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great penance .
She nursed her child herself , made swaddling − bands for it out of her coverlet , the only one which she had on her bed , and no longer felt either cold or hunger .
It is certain that if the soul had not already quitted this inert , sluggish , lethargic body , it had at least retreated and concealed itself in depths whither the perceptions of the exterior organs no longer penetrated .
It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all , that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries , and that from the moment he presented himself , there existed among them a secret , suppressed rivalry , which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves , but which broke forth , none the less , every instant , in their gestures and remarks .
`` The devil ! '' said Jehan , to himself , `` it is a long while to wait for a crown ! ''
`` Master Pierrat − − Master Jacques , I mean , busy yourself with Marc Cenaine . ''
For a while she had tried to count the black minutes measured off for her by the drop of water ; but that melancholy labor of an ailing brain had broken off of itself in her head , and had left her in stupor .
There was another moment when , while laughing diabolically at himself , he represented to himself la Esmeralda as he had seen her on that first day , lively , careless , joyous , gayly attired , dancing , winged , harmonious , and la Esmeralda of the last day , in her scanty shift , with a rope about her neck , mounting slowly with her bare feet , the angular ladder of the gallows ; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner .that he gave vent to a terrible cry .
Let us add that the church , that vast church , which surrounded her on every side , which guarded her , which saved her , was itself a sovereign tranquillizer .
The priest , beside himself , was about to seize it .
He had thought it very simple on the part of people who had , like herself , nothing else in prospect but Charmolue and Torterue , and who , unlike himself , did not gallop through the regions of imagination between the wings of Pegasus .
The locksmiths , although protected by the deep vaults of the portal , abandoned the door and Clopin himself retired to a respectful distance from the church .
Hold , Master Olivier ; I desire to see that cage myself .
A touch from the young girl , as she drew her foot from under him , brought him to himself .
In itself , he found the order very welcome .
Miss Bürstner looked at the floor in front of her , quiet and a little sunk in on herself .
And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself .
On the other hand , it was possible that the officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court 's purposes .
The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself , saluted , and hurried on , walking with very short steps , probably because of gout .
If you do n't want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I 've sorted out my report , then I 'll be glad to go back with you again . "
But so much soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off K. 's hands with her handkerchief , as K. was too tired to do that for himself .
So please , be so kind as to help me on my way a little , I 'm feeling dizzy , you see , and it 'll make me ill if I stand up by myself . "
`` Yes , '' said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh , " I wanted to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she 's stubborn , she wants to move everything in herself .
But will you push things forward yourself with all your strength , if so , that will naturally be far better . "
Never attract attention to yourself !
How could he ever carry on by himself after he 's taken on help from a lawyer ?
But the deputy director did not notice this at all , or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits , he frequently laughed out loud , one time he clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself , and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion .
Now , in contrast , if he was to conduct his defence himself , he would have to devote himself entirely to the court - for the time being , at least - success would mean , later on , his complete and conclusive liberation , but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself , to start with , in far greater danger than he had been in so far .
Perhaps - this is what I 've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to help you in some small way , he knows lots of judges and even if he ca n't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side .
He felt himself as much at liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower standing , keeping everything about himself to himself , speaking only casually about the interests of the other , able to raise him to a level above one 's own , but also able , at will , to let him drop again .
The superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves . "
But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there 's a small error running through what he says , and , just for your interest , I 'll tell you about it .
For himself , he wanted to go to the lawyer and , by dismissing him , free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman . But before he had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently .
Embarrassed , Block ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet , his anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the lawyer for a while , he thought only about himself and turned the judges words round to examine them from all sides .
He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - they were standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself , but then - he gave no more precise reason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. with him .
`` Some ancient , unimportant actors - that 's what they 've sent for me , '' said K. to himself , and looked round once again to confirm this to himself . `` They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can . ''
K. now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself .
It was a simple matter to throw off the covers ; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves .
`` But Sir , '' called Gregor , beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement , " I 'll open up immediately , just a moment .
Whatever was said next would be crucial , so , in order to make his voice as clear as possible , he coughed a little , but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself .
This is what peace I get in my old age ! " And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself , let the women take him to the door , send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor 's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him .
When they are , it is easier to hold them , especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government ; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them ; because the two peoples , preserving in other things the old conditions , and not being unlike in customs , will live quietly together , as one has seen in Brittany , Burgundy , Gascony , and Normandy , which have been bound to France for so long a time : and , although there may be some difference in language , nevertheless the customs are alike , and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves .
And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves , each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country , according to the authority he had assumed there ; and the family of the former lord being exterminated , none other than the Romans were acknowledged .
But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince , and his family is exterminated , they , being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince , can not agree in making one from amongst themselves , and they do not know how to govern themselves .
For this reason they are very slow to take up arms , and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily .
Hence it is to be remarked that , in seizing a state , the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict , and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily ; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them , and win them to himself by benefits .
It was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .
Oblonsky understood that Matthew meant to have a joke and draw attention to himself .
He thought a plain kindly fellow like himself might be loved as a friend , but to be loved with the kind of love he felt for Kitty , a man must be handsome and above all remarkable .
He had to make an effort and reason with himself that all sorts of people were passing near her and he himself might have come just to skate .
When he thought about her he could vividly picture to himself her entire person , and especially the charm of her small , fair-haired head , so lightly poised on the shapely girlish shoulders , and the childlike brightness and kindness of her face .
Oblonsky repeated these lines with a subtle smile and Levin himself could not help smiling . ' No , but joking apart , ' continued Oblonsky , ' just consider .
She felt that this evening , when those two men were to meet for the first time , would decide her fate ; and she kept picturing them to herself , now individually and now together .
' Oh God , must I tell him so myself ? ' she thought . ' Must I really tell him that I do n't care for him ?
As soon as her brother came up to her she threw her left arm round his neck with a movement that struck Vronsky by its firmness and grace , and drawing him to herself gave him a vigorous kiss .
But have a wash and smarten yourself up , ' said the Baroness , again sitting down and carefully turning a small screw of the coffee-pot . ' Pierre , pass me the coffee , ' she said to Petritsky whom , not concealing their relations , she called Pierre ( the French for Peter ) , because of his surname .
Now she knew them all as well as the inhabitants of a provincial town know one another ; she knew the habits and weaknesses of each of them , and where the shoe pinched this or that foot ; she knew their relations to one another and to the governing centre ; she knew who sided with whom , and how and by what means each supported himself , and who agreed or disagreed with whom and about what ; but ( in spite of admonitions and advice from the Countess Lydia Ivanovna ) this bureaucratic circle of male interests could not interest Anna , and she avoided it .
No one knows ; but their host 's footman , in answer to their question whether `` girls '' lived there , replies that there are a lot of them thereabouts . After dinner the young men go into the host 's study to compose a letter to the fair stranger , and , having written one full of passion and containing a declaration , they carry it upstairs themselves , in order to explain anything that might not be quite clear in the letter . '
One of us is stupid , and you know it 's impossible to say so of oneself . '
Not these two ladies alone , but nearly all those present in the drawing-room , even the Princess Myagkaya and Betsy herself , several times glanced across at the pair who had gone away from the general circle , as if their having done so disturbed the others .
I do n't like to do things badly myself and I see that others do n't .
Oblonsky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the varnished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
' Here it is ! ' answered Levin , pointing to Laska , who with one ear erect , wagging her fluffy , high-arched tail , stepping slowly as if to prolong the pleasure and seeming almost to smile , brought the dead bird to her master . ' Well , I 'm glad you got it , ' said Levin , and while he spoke he was already experiencing a feeling of envy at not having killed the bird himself .
They had not arranged this , but it had come about of itself .
It was as if there was something that she could not , and would not , make clear to herself , or as if , as soon as she began to speak about this matter , she , the real Anna , withdrew into herself and another woman appeared who was strange and alien to him , whom he feared and did not like , and who resisted him .
I will tell it you all in advance , ' and an evil light came into her eyes which a minute before had been so tender . ' - `` Ah , you love another and have entered into a guilty union with him ? '' - ' ( mimicking her husband , she laid just such a stress on the word guilty as Karenin himself would have done ) . ' - " I warned you of the consequences from the religious , civil , and family points of view .
He is not a man , but a machine , and a cruel machine when angry , ' she added , picturing Karenin to herself with every detail of his figure and way of speaking ,
Karenin thought and said that in no previous year had he had so much official business as this year ; but he was not conscious of the fact that this year he invented work for himself , and that this was one of the means of keeping that compartment closed where lay his feelings for and thoughts of his family , which became more terrible the longer they lay there .
He did not let himself think about this and did not think about it , yet at the bottom of his soul , without admitting it to himself or having any proofs or even suspicions of it , he nevertheless knew certainly that he was a wronged husband , and was therefore profoundly unhappy .
Without acknowledging it to himself , Karenin now looked out for opportunities of having a third person present at his interviews with his wife .
' Well , if you want to so much , I will inquire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' What do you see particular in her ?
' Shameful in what respect ? ' she said . ' You could not have told a man who was himself indifferent to you that you loved him ? '
It was one of those things which one knows and yet can not say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
' I do n't know very well myself .
He did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for impairing his peace of mind and his honour . And having reviewed the possibilities of a duel , of divorce , and of separation , and having again rejected them , Karenin came to the conclusion that there was only one course to be followed : to keep her with him , hiding from the world what had happened , and taking all necessary steps to put a stop to her love-affair , and above all ( though he did not confess this to himself to punish her .
Like all such matters it went on of itself , by inertia .
The approaching step of the footman recalled her to herself , and hiding her face from him she pretended to be writing .
But latterly new inner relations had sprung up between himself and her , which frightened him by their indefiniteness .
Ambition was the old motive of his childhood and youth , one which he did not acknowledge even to himself , but which was so strong a passion that it now struggled against his love .
' It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irritably . ' And here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her glove .
She understood at once that he had already considered this by himself , knew that whatever he might say he would not tell her all that he was thinking , and knew that her last hopes had been deceived .
' Ours is peasant 's business ; we look after everything ourselves .
' All I wish to say is , ' said Levin , ' why should we not seek them for ourselves ? '
' And how do you agree with Spencer yourself in this matter ? '
But in spite of this , Levin thought matters were getting on , and that by keeping strict accounts and insisting on having his way he would eventually be able to prove to the peasants the advantage of these new arrangements , and that things would then go on of themselves .
' I am not bothering about them : I am doing it for myself . '
' That 's all very well , but you think only of yourself !
Karenin smiled coldly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lacerated his wound .
Wait a bit . I will tell you about myself .
He was vexed , not so much at having missed that post himself and at having been obviously passed over , as at the incomprehensible and surprising fact that they did not realize how much less suitable than anyone else was that voluble windbag , Stremov .
Try and realize it : even his looks have a physical effect on me and drive me beside myself .
I understand that you can not take it upon yourself to express your wishes and feelings . '
She could not think of or desire anything but life with this man ; but , as that life had not yet begun , she could not even clearly picture it to herself .
Though he had imagined his ideas about family life to be most exact , he , like all men , had involuntarily pictured it to himself as merely the enjoyment of love - which nothing should be allowed to hinder and from which one should not be distracted by petty cares .
They both tried in after life to efface from their memories all the ugly shameful circumstances of this unhealthy time during which they were rarely in a normal state and rarely themselves .
She ordered supper to be brought , unpacked their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprinkle insect powder on them .
Only the invalid himself did not show that desire , but on the contrary was angry because the doctor had not been fetched , and he continued taking medicine and talking of life .
Without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
He felt that he could not divert from himself people 's hatred , because that hatred was caused not by his badness ( had it been so he might have tried to be better ) but by his disgraceful and repulsive misery .
Do not thank me . I am not doing it of myself ... '
' But , my dear friend , do not give way to that feeling you were speaking about - of being ashamed of that which is the utmost height of Christianity ! `` He that humbleth himself shall be exalted , '' and you must not thank me ! - You must thank Him , and ask Him for help .
Forgive me for reminding you of myself .
Renewed pain for yourself , and pain for the child !
This letter achieved the secret purpose which the Countess Lydia Ivanovna hid even from herself . It wounded Anna to the depths of her soul .
' Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . '
He was aware that the teacher himself did not believe what he was saying ; he felt that by the tone in which the words were uttered . ' But why have they all agreed to speak in the same way about the dullest and most useless things ?
Tushkevich , Yashvin , the Princess Barbara ... ' he pictured them to himself . ' And what of me ?
All these were relations and friends of Kitty 's , and , though Levin liked them , he regretted his own - the Levin - world and order of things , which was being submerged by this influx of ' the Shcherbatsky element , ' as he put it to himself .
' It 's very nice at their place , ' Vasenka was saying , talking of Vronsky and Anna . ' Of course I do not take it upon myself to judge , but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family . '
' What the devil brings him here ? ' muttered Levin to himself , turning back to the vehicle . ' Why did you leave the road ? ' he asked drily , and calling the coachman , set to work to get the horses out .
' Do you know , you will bring trouble on yourself , ' said Oblonsky , having found his cap and getting up .
Here they are themselves ! ' cried the man , pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a char-a-banc coming along the road .
' Tell me about yourselves . I meet Steve in passing , but he ca n't tell me about the children .
The Count goes into everything himself .
Veslovsky offered his arm to the Princess Barbara before Tushkevich could do so , so that the latter , the steward , and the doctor went in by themselves .
Vasenka Veslovsky , her husband , and even Sviyazhsky and many others whom she knew , never thought about these things , and readily believed , what every decent host wishes his guests to feel , that all that is so well arranged at his house has cost him no trouble but has come about of itself .
' But tell me about yourself . I have much to talk to you about and I have been talking with ...
There she not only helped , but arranged and planned many things herself .
Nevertheless , her chief preoccupation was still herself - herself in so far as Vronsky held her dear and in so far as she could compensate him for all he had given up .
With him it was a sign of great displeasure , not with her but with himself .
Well , you see , any other woman in her position might fail to find resources in herself .
I restrain myself , wait , invent occupations for myself , - the English family , writing , reading , but all that is only deception , it is all a kind of morphia .
' Is it possible that I ca n't ... ? Is it possible that I ca n't take it on myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning .
And death , as the sole means of reviving love for herself in his heart , of punishing him , and of gaining the victory in that contest which an evil spirit in her heart was waging against him , presented itself clearly and vividly to her .
' Well , in that case I know what I must do , ' said she to herself , and conscious of a vague sense of wrath and a desire for vengeance rising within her , she ran upstairs . ' I shall go to him myself .
Remembering Karenin , she pictured him to herself with extraordinary vividness , as if he stood before her , with his mild , dull , lifeless eyes , the blue veins of his white hands , his intonations , his cracking fingers , and remembering the feeling that had once existed between them and which had also been called love , she shuddered with revulsion . ' Well , I get divorced and become Vronsky 's wife !
' There ! ' she said to herself , looking at the shadow of the truck on the mingled sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers . ' There , into the very middle , and I shall punish him and escape from everybody and from myself ! '
He admitted that the papers published much that was unnecessary and exaggerated with the sole aim of drawing attention to themselves , each outcrying the other .
These matters interested him , not because he justified them to himself by any general theories as he had done previously ; on the contrary , being now on the one hand disenchanted by the ill-success of his former occupations for the general welfare , and on the other hand too much occupied with his own thoughts and by the mass of affairs that overwhelmed him from all sides , he quite abandoned all calculation of public utility , and these matters interested him only because it seemed to him that he had to do what he was doing , and could not act otherwise .
It seemed to him that he had a reply to that question ; but he had no time to express it to himself before he entered the nursery .
Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien , and very sincere and honest at heart ; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence , and so separated them from worldly matters , that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days .
`` Hello yourself , and see how you like it . ''
You got to go all by yourself , to the middle of the woods , where you know there 's a spunk-water stump , and just as it 's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say :
If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom 's disjointed mutterings , he kept it to himself .
Because if he 'd had one she 'd a burnt him out herself !
`` It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be -- and laws bless me , to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream , never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour , and I never to see him again in this world , never , never , never , poor abused boy ! ''
When the worst came to the worst , she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple , but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still -- because , said she to herself , " he 'll tell about me tearing the picture sure .
`` Lordy , I do n't want to foller him by myself ! ''
If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition , and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works .
